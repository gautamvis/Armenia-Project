used its annual report to urge the incoming Obama administration to make the protection and defense of human rights the central tenant of its policy decisions on foreign and national affairs,Human Rights Watch HRW has used its annual report to urge the incoming Obama administration to make the protection and defense of human rights the central tenant of its policy decisions on foreign and national affairsThe group says that is the only way to undo what it calls the enormous damage of the Bush yearsHRWs London director Tom Porteous says President George W Bushs war on terror has been waged without regard for human rights with the result that many governments around the world have turned a similarly blind eye to the issueThe Bush years have been disastrous for human rights because the United States itself has abandoned human rights in its counterterrorism policies Porteous says And this has sent a message to repressive governments around the world that abuse of human rights is acceptable and carries no serious cost So we are calling on Presidentelect Barack Obama to reverse thatPorteous calls the last eight years depressing for human rights advocates but says the change of presidential administration is a chance for the United States to regain its global credibility as a leader on rights issuesWith that goal HRW is calling on Obama to send a clear signal that the United States is abandoning abusive tactics in its counterterrorism efforts Those efforts have included interrogation techniques that use methods considered torture under international law and maintaining a US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Cuba where socalled enemy combatants are held without charge and denied due process The group is also urging Obama to take a friendlier attitude than Bush did toward the International Criminal Court ICC and the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva possibly even seeking membership on the council and resigning the ICC treaty to show that it has rejoined the global rights communityNo Longer Human Rights ChampionThe 2009 report also criticizes governments that pay lip service to human rights in order to gain international credibility but then ignore or abuse their citizens rights in domestic policies Porteous cited China and Russia as two governments that work actively at the United Nations to undermine international human rights standards so as to protect oppressors and shield abusersThese states have all in different ways been very active in defending the rights of other states to abuse their people in the name of sovereignty noninterference and regional solidarity Porteous saysAnd because the United States has not been engaged in any of this diplomacy and because its credibility on human rights has been undermined by its own abuses this has really left the European Union as sort of the only serious champion of human rights in the world he adds And the European Union because some of its own interests and also because of some of its own internal problems has really not been up to the task of fulfilling that role effectivelyA united EUUS front on human rights abuse Human Rights Watch says would present a formidable challenge to abusive governmentsThe report cites the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza  where more than 900 civilians have been killed in fighting between Israel and Hamas  as underscoring the need for the world to work harder to prevent the human rights abuses that accompany armed conflicts todayThat means the United States must be willing to hold its allies accountable for rights violations Above all I think its important that the Obama administration give a strong indication that its going to stop turning a blind eye to abuses of its major allies that are being justified in the name of counterterrorism and that would include the abuses of allies in the Middle East including Israel Porteous saysBelow are highlights from HRWs 2009 reportIn Iran Human Rights Watch says President Mahmud Ahmadinejad continues to use national security as a reason for crushing dissent In 2008 there was a dramatic rise in arrests of political activists academics journalists and others for peacefully exercising their rights of free expression and association in Iran the report says Iran s execution of underage offenders has been widely criticizedIt also cites numerous reports of the torture and mistreatment of such detainees The countrys judiciary and the Ministry of Intelligence commit most of the countrys serious human rights violations according to the report which notes that the number of executions increased sharply in 2008 Iranian law allows death sentences for girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15The report says human rights conditions in Iraq remain extremely poor More than 25 million Iraqis have been displaced by the war and those that remain are frequent targets of attacks by Sunni and Shiite armed groups HRW cites reports of widespread torture and abuse in detention facilities which are run by Iraqs Defense and Interior ministries  Afghanistan is experiencing its worst violence since the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001 the report says Widespread human rights abuses warlordism and impunity persist The Taliban has extended its control across parts of the country once considered free and stableHRW says the government of President Hamid Karzai lacks the will to institute needed reforms and corruption is rampant In particular the report criticizes Karzai for not implementing the Action Plan for Peace Reconciliation and Justice which it passed in 2006 Most strikingly the report says Afghan women and girls rank among the worlds worstoff by most indicators including maternal mortality life expectancy and literacyTajikistans human rights problems are numerous and chronic the rights group says citing lack of access to justice due process violations and illtreatment in custody Though Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov has opened the country somewhat its still one of the most repressive in the worldIt criticizes the government for exercising what it calls excessive control over NGOs religious organizations political parties and the media and notes that authorities in the capital Dushanbe are continuing a policy of forcibly and sometimes violently evicting people living in the city center These dislocated Tajiks are resettled on the city outskirts sometimes in unsafe buildings according to HRWIn the last two years Turkmenistans government has begun to reverse the cult of personality that former President Saparmurat Niyazov built around himself HRW says citing changes for the better like a new constitution and the abolition of devastating social policies But while new President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov has ended the countrys selfimposed isolation and attracted foreign interest in the countrys hydrocarbon resources Turkmenistan remains one of the most repressive and authoritarian countries according to the reportHundreds perhaps thousands of people languish in Turkmen prisons on convictions on politicallymotivated charges HRW says independent activists and journalists in exile are under constant threat of government reprisal and no independent organization has been permitted to carry out research on human rights abuses inside the country or gain access to detention facilitiesThe Uzbek governments human rights record remains abysmal according to HRWDuring 2008 the authorities continued to suppress independent civilsociety activism and religious worship and to deny accountability for the 2005 Andijon massacre Despite this international pressure on the Uzbek government has actually declined as a result of the partial lifting of European Union sanctionsUnder President Islam Karimov HRW says the lack of rule of law is a fundamental structural problem The judiciary lacks independence and a deeply entrenched culture of impunity for abuses persistsThe report says local media outlets are not free and the government refuses to accredit foreign journalists while also blocking access to many websites offering independent information on Uzbekistan and on topics deemed sensitive by the government It also says forced child labor in the countrys cotton fields remains a key rights concernThe HRW report takes Russia to task for using cluster bombs in areas populated by civilians during its August 2008 war with Georgia and for failing to protect civilians in areas under its effective control The report says its investigators found evidence that members of the South Ossetian militia and armed criminal gangs looted and burned homes and killed raped beat and threatened civilians in these areas Inside Russia HRW says the government of President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has continued to tighten control over civil society through selective implementation of the law on NGOs restriction and censure of protected expression and the media and harassment of activists and human rights defendersIn Belarus sometimes called the last dictatorship in Europe HRW says authorities continue to use the criminal justice system to control civil society political opposition and the media The report says in 2008 as in previous years several opposition activists and journalists were arrested and jailed for participating in unsanctioned protests Violence was used against some activists and journalists during demonstrationsHRW notes that Belarus released its last remaining political prisoners in 2008 but at least 10 activists continue to serve restricted freedom sentences that permit them only to be at home or at work Armenia experienced one of its most serious civil and political rights crises since independence when security forces used excessive force in March 2008 against opposition demonstrators protesting the results of the February presidential election according to the HRW report Testimony from local human rights defenders includes reports of torture and illtreatment in custody And journalists particularly those critical of the government continue to face politicallymotivated charges

https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenian_Speaker_Europe_Political_Prisoners/1365251.html,Armenian Speaker Chides Europe Over Political Prisoners ,"December 30, 2008 17:47 GMT",YEREVAN RFERL  The speaker of Armenias parliament Hovik Abrahamian has suggested European multilateral organizations are applying a double standard toward Armenia and some other member states over purported political prisoners,YEREVAN RFERL  The speaker of Armenias parliament Hovik Abrahamian has suggested European multilateral organizations are applying a double standard toward Armenia and some other member states over purported political prisoners  Abrahamian also argued that his countrys authorities have been consistent in complying with the demands set by two successive resolutions on Armenia adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE in the wake of violence in Yerevan following the February presidential vote and a government crackdown on political opponents protesting the outcome   In an interview this week with RFERLs Armenian Service Abrahamian said that despite PACEs urgings it would be wrong to declare a general amnesty for more than 100 opposition members and supporters who were arrested and jailed in connection with the deadly March 1 clashes until after their trials are concluded  The president Serzh Sarkisian has said on many occasions that while a general amnesty is not excluded it can only happen after the completion of court trials Abrahamian said As for pardons you know that the president has already responded to three appeals to grant pardons to three citizens  One of the demands of PACEs April and June resolutions was to release opposition members detained on seemingly artificial or politically motivated charges  On December 17 the PACE Monitoring Committee for the first time described the jailed Armenian oppositionists as political prisoners and urged the Strasbourgbased body to impose sanctions on Armenia by stripping its eightmember delegation of the voting rights  Abrahamian denies the presence of political prisoners in Armenia until the completion of trials of leading opposition members The trial of seven opposition figures charged with plotting a coup began in Yerevan earlier this month amid renewed opposition claims that the defendants in the trial including Armenias former foreign minister and three members of parliament are victims of political persecution   No one has the right to use the term political prisoner I think there are no political prisoners in Armenia And the president of the republic on numerous occasions has said that no one will be condemned for their political views Abrahamian said In general I dont want the Council of Europe to apply double standards in relation to different countries since by moving to deprive Armenia of its voting right which is very unacceptable for us they will thus show a discriminative approach If so Azerbaijan should have been deprived of its voting rights still in 2001 since the presence of political prisoners there was already proved then  There has been only talk of it in Armenia and the presence of political prisoners in Armenia hasnt been grounded yet Abrahamian said I am convinced that it will be correct if the Council of Europe allows time and opportunity for trials to be completed and at that time after steps taken by the republics president we will draw conclusions  At the same time Abrahamian said Armenia highly values its relations with the Council of Europe and generally with European structures  Of course we must do everything to prevent the sanctions from becoming a reality he said During the vote on the PACE Monitoring Committees recommendation people will hear the reasons and I am sure the right decision will be made  Abrahamian went on to suggest it was in the interest of the opposition to have protracted trials and urge radical opponents not to obstruct any ongoing legal processes  I am convinced that our countrys president in general is against having political prisoners and will not allow any citizen to be convicted for his political views Abrahamian added
https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenian_PM_Defends_Economic_Policies_In_Face_Of_Global_Crisis_/1364811.html,Armenian PM Defends Economic Policies In Face Of Global Crisis ,"December 29, 2008 16:16 GMT",The Armenian prime minister believes the set of measures foreseen by the government will help Armenia cope with the negative consequences and minimize the impact of the continuing economic crisis in 2009,The Armenian prime minister believes the set of measures foreseen by the government will help Armenia cope with the negative consequences and minimize the impact of the continuing economic crisis in 2009Tigran Sarkisian said more investments in infrastructure development and several large projects to be launched by the state will provide new jobs for people to offset possible redundancies elsewhereWe should essentially increase our spending in such directions as infrastructure development including road and housing construction rehabilitation efforts in the 1988 Spitak earthquake area projects in the energy sector irrigation and drinkingwatersupply systems which coupled with a drastic increase in lending to small and mediumsized enterprises will create new jobs Sarkisian said in an interview with RFERLs Armenian Service last weekBesides we also plan to carry out several large projects that will provide essentially help in dealing with the consequences of the crisis he continued These in particular include the construction of the northsouth highway with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank a program which has regional significance and is due to be carried out jointly with Georgia as well as the construction of a new nuclear power plant and the construction of an IranArmenia railway All these programs also imply the creation of new jobs Sarkisian also referred to some international evaluations including those made by Moodys International ratings agency predicting stability for Armenia in the immediate futureBut he added All predictions made in the world today change every week and it is conditioned by the circumstance that the global financial and economic crisis is gathering new momentum and there is no methodology or institution that would be able to make precise predictions as to how long this crisis will last and what impact it will have on developing countries So I think it would be more correct if instead of spreading pessimistic sentiments which by itself creates negative expectations and deepens the crisis we should speak realisticallySarkisian concedes that Armenia is expected to end the year with a tremendous foreigntrade deficit with imports exceeding exports nearly fourfoldBut he cited the example of the United States which in the past 28 years has imported more goods than it exported and by no means is among the worlds worst economies Naturally Armenia has a very serious problem that is structural readjustments are taking place a new structure of the economy is emerging and we should be able to understand what the future of our economic system is and what structure our economy should have Sarkisian saidMany dream of the day when we will have a strong machinebuilding sector when we will manufacture and export goods like those in China or India But I think all realize well it is not a future for us he added Our strategy is to focus on an economy based on labor and intellect rather than materials which means that we should primarily pay attention to the balance of payments not the export of commodities but the export of services and carrying out economic activities not only in the territory of Armenia but also in its worldwide diasporaThe prime minister is hopeful that Armenia will manage to carry out successful reforms required for continued US government aid under the Millennium Challenge Account We have indeed made pledges to our own people to make these reforms also in terms of forming a system of good governance It is not a secret that we do have numerous difficulties such as corruption bribery an ineffective governance system low revenues the presence of more than a hundred thousand socially vulnerable families and we should overcome these difficulties also due to the Millennium Challenge Account program Sarkisian said We are extremely grateful to our American partners for the technical assistance that they have rendered to the Armenian government so that we can overcome all these existing difficulties he added Therefore we have developed a clear program which has also been appreciated by the Millennium Challenge Account office And the program of these measures has a timetable and people who is in charge of ensuring its proper executionGovernment ReformsSarkisian also rejected allegations by some government critics that in the past several months the central bank has reneged on its adopted floating policy for currency exchange rates and has sought to keep the national currency from depreciating against major world currencies with financial interventions on the foreignexchange marketOur concept that we have developed together with the International Monetary Fund in 1993 implies that Armenia sticks to the socalled floating exchange rate policy for its national currency which means that it is formed by the supply and demand existing on the market We have remained committed to this policy and will stay committed to it in the future We are not going to make artificial interventions in the formation of the exchange rate because it is fraught with many consequences he emphasizedSarkisian also spoke in favor of creating equal conditions for competition in the agricultural sector though he said this would not include protectionism He also said that beginning next month large agricultural enterprises will have to pay valueadded taxes like enterprises in other sectors do This strategy implies that agriculture like in any country of the world should also be taxable he said noting that the sector has been exempted from all taxes thus farThe prime minister also reiterated the government commitment to fight corruption and stressed the role of the active engagement of civilsociety organizations and opposition political parties in the anticorruption measuresThats why I urged all opposition political parties to have an active participation in our anticorruption program in particular through monitoring which is one of the key instruments Sarkisian said adding that this control will essentially increase public faith in the program and will raise its efficiency Rejecting RestrictionsResponding to the question about the state of democracy in Armenia in a year that has seen plenty of criticism from various international organizations of how Armenia has been handling its worstever internal political crisis Sarkisian said Freedom of speech democratic values do not imply that our country should be sliding into chaos Freedom of speech is not arbitrariness People should also have a sense of responsibilityIn particular he responded to opposition claims that the authorities restrict its freedom of assembly by refusing to provide space for its political gatheringsWe provide the government conference hall to organizations on a contractual basis and if so the rules stipulated by the contract must be respected he said We have added one point to our contract that if an organization fails to observe the rules then it does not get the conference hall at the second time of asking This is a democratic approach If we do not respect our word ourselves no one will respect itSarkisian also denied any political implications behind the parliaments decision to suspend the tenders for TV frequencies in view of the mandatory digitalization of broadcasting in the country Government critics say the move is primarily aimed at preventing A1 a television station critical of the authorities from returning to the air after it was controversially pulled off in 2002 Sarkisian said he regrets that the decision to postpone tenders for TV frequencies has become a matter of political speculation All international organizations with which I have dealt with regarding this matter fully accept our reasons Furthermore we had no alternative to this decision he said We could not announce a competition for two years because we have an international commitment to achieve digitalization in the broadcasting sphere and time should be given to the private sector to get ready for the tenders in which this transition that we must complete within five years should be consideredThe prime minister also disagrees that financial penalties against Bjni a leading mineralwater producer are in any way linked to its owner proopposition lawmaker Khachatur Sukiasian who has been in hiding since the start of the government crackdown on opposition members who backed to former President Levon TerPetrossian in the February presidential election I do not agree that there is any political persecution in this case But I agree that one must not be persecuted for political views especially in the economic sphere he said As for Bjni it is obvious that the company made serious violations evaded taxes And I would want you to focus on this issue in the first place Didnt it in fact evade millions in taxes It is essential to answer this question and by answering it we will refrain from such political speculationsThe exercise of tax control started a long time ago and it concerned not only Bjni but also other enterprises including those working in the same sphere Such violations were found at many enterprises But unlike Bjni those enterprises admitted their fault and fulfilled their tax obligations Meanwhile Bjni is trying to politicize the matter to avoid fulfillment of obligations that it has toward the state budget which is inadmissible the prime minister concluded

GMT",The gloves came off in Georgia An olive branch came out in Armenia And the prospect of a peace settlement beckoned in NagornoKarabakh,The gloves came off in Georgia An olive branch came out in Armenia And the prospect of a peace settlement beckoned in NagornoKarabakhRussia which had seen its influence in the South Caucasus wane in recent years roared back with a vengeance to stake a claim in a region that Moscow has long seen as its natural sphere of influence From the bitter August war between Russia and Georgia to Tbilisis stalled bid to join NATO to Armenias surprising overtures to archrival Turkey 2008 was a year of geopolitical tremors highrisk maneuvers and greatpower jockeying in the restive South CaucasusAnd analysts say this strategically vital region is on the brink of still more turbulence as Russia continues to reassert itself and the uneasy postSoviet status quo  with its unsettled frozen conflicts in Abkhazia South Ossetia and NagornoKarabakh  comes unraveled I think what we are seeing is the unfreezing of situations that had existed since the breakup of the Soviet Union or shortly thereafter in the early 1990s says Lawrence Sheets a Tbilisibased analyst and Caucasus program director for the International Crisis GroupYou saw that with the increasing frustration among the current Georgian leadership with the situations in Abkhazia and South Ossetia Sheets continues In terms of the situation between Azerbaijan and Armenia I think we are obviously seeing some sort of movement and that movement is the result of external factorsStrategic NormalcyThis was also the year that Western dreams of promoting democracy in the South Caucasus were dealt setbacks across the boardIn Armenia Serzh Sarkisian won the presidency in February in an election that the opposition and international observers claimed was flawed After the vote the authorities violently suppressed opposition demonstrations Approximately one thousand people were arrested and 10 were killed in the immediate postelection violence Some 67 opposition figures remain in custodyElections in Azerbaijan were not seen as free or fairThe authoritarian regime of President Ilham Aliyev in energyrich Azerbaijan too tightened its visegrip on power Aliyev won reelection in October with 87 percent of the vote in a poll that observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE said did not meet international standards Baku has also faced international condemnation for the jailing of opposition journalistsAnd Georgia which the United States has tried to hold up as a beacon of good governance in the region continued to backslide on the democratic promise of the 2003 Rose RevolutionLincoln Mitchell a Columbia University professor and the author of the upcoming book Uncertain Democracy US Foreign Policy and Georgias Rose Revolution says the domestic politics of the three countries in the region are returning to what he calls strategic normalcyAzerbaijan and Armenia are settling into being secular illiberal regimes that are really what we have in most of the former Soviet Union Mitchell says Georgia is a Westernoriented secular illiberal regime And that causes it some problems But in fact the states look more similar now than they did five years agoWatershed ConflictIf the South Caucasus is indeed entering a new period of increased Russian influence and democratic retrenchment the watershed event will clearly be the fiveday war between Georgia and Russia in AugustSince coming to power after the 2003 Rose Revolution Georgias President Mikheil Saakashvili had infuriated Moscow by moving his country closer to the West and seeking to join NATOIn a recent interview with RFERL Matthew Bryza US deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs called the war a defining momentBryza has condemned Moscows actions in GeorgiaIt is a watershed because Russia demonstrated that it is willing to be a belligerent and use force against smaller neighbors Bryza said In fact against a neighbor with a military that is maybe 1100th of its size That act has sent some powerful signals reverberating through the CaucasusThe conflict began on August 7 when Georgian forces entered the Moscowbacked breakaway region of South Ossetia claiming that separatist forces were shelling Georgian villages Russia responded with a massive retaliation with its forces thrusting deep into GeorgiaRussia pulled its troops out of most of Georgia proper following a Frenchbrokered ceasefire But Moscow continues to keep a large contingent of forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia another proMoscow breakaway Georgian province Russian troops also continue to occupy a socalled buffer zone around the two regionsFollowing the conflict Moscow recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia but only Nicaragua has followed suitAnd the war resulted in a much larger Russian footprint in the region There is a bigger Russian role in the region because now they Russians formally control South Ossetia and Abkhazia Lincoln Mitchell says Theres a bigger Russian role in the region because the only antiRussian voice in the region just got its hat handed to them by the Russian militaryRussian RealpolitikAnd although Moscow faced harsh international criticism for what many in the West called a disproportionate response it was able to weather the storm The European Union suspended talks on a Partnership and Association Agreement but decided in December to renew negotiations The NATORussia Council was also suspended although at a foreign ministers meeting in December the alliance decided to revive informal highlevel meetings with MoscowAt the same foreign ministers meeting NATO declined to grant Georgia and Ukraine Membership Action Plans MAPs a key step to membership setting back Tbilisis goal of joining the alliance quickly Eight months earlier at NATOs summit in Bucharest facing fierce lobbying from Russia the allies also declined to give Georgia and Ukraine MAPs The alliance did however promise eventual membership for the two countriesApparently many Western countries believe that the costs of alienating or isolating Russia are just too high and Moscow is aware of this Moscow has quite skillfully weaved its way through this situation Western countries are faced with a conundrum and that is choosing between Georgia as a strategic ally or Russia Lawrence Sheets saysRussia is a country of 150 million people with massive energy resources and nuclear weapons Georgia is a developing country of 4 million people he adds I think inevitably realpolitik becomes part of it and the Russians see that the price to be paid is often shortterm and one of rhetoric and doesnt boil down to much that is concreteGeorgias leadership also did not help its own case in its NATO bid Saakashvili came under heavy criticism for what diplomats and analysts describe as an illadvised move to try to resolve the South Ossetia conflict by forceMoreover Georgias reputation as a beacon of democracy in the region began to wane in November 2007 when Saakashvili cracked down on opposition demonstrations in Tbilisi and temporarily closed down independent media outletsSaakashvili won reelection as president in January And his party the United National Movement won a decisive majority in parliamentary elections in May albeit amidst allegations of voter intimidation and bullyingHopes For Karabakh PeaceIf Georgia was preoccupied with war the focus in Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to resolving the regions other frozen conflict  NagornoKarabakhOn November 2 following Russianmediated talks in Moscow Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed the first joint statement by Yerevan and Baku since the 1994 truce that ended the NagornoKarabakh war Despite the tensions in USRussian relations over Georgia Bryza stressed that Washington welcomed Moscows efforts on NagornoKarabakh a predominantly ethnicArmenian enclave within Azerbaijan that broke free from Bakus control in the early 1990s in a war that killed an estimated 30000 peopleRussian President Dmitry Medvedevs meeting on November 2 made an important contribution So I want to be fair here When Russia is being unhelpful weve got to call it like we see it But Russia is being quite helpful on KarabakhThe Moscow Declaration mainly reiterated previous positions committing the two sides to resolving the conflict peacefully according to international law and under the auspices of the OSCEs Minsk Group comprising Russia France and the United StatesNevertheless analysts took it as a sign that there could finally be movement on what has been a longstalled peace process Basically we have had a situation between Azerbaijan and Armenia that has not changed in 15 years for the most part Sheets notes And I think we are beginning to see the situation change It is changing through external dynamics in regard to Armenia and Turkey and in regard to Russias role in the regionArmenia also made strides this year in improving its longstrained relations with Turkey In a move dubbed football diplomacy Sarkisian invited his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to Yerevan to watch an international soccer match between their national teams in SeptemberThe two held an extended closeddoor meeting before heading off to the match which Turkey won 20 Turkey was among the first countries to recognize Armenian independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union But when Armenian forces occupied NagornoKarabakh and surrounding regions Ankara broke off diplomatic ties with Yerevan and closed its border with Armenia in solidarity with its ally Azerbaijan Moreover Yerevans claim that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I constitutes genocide is angrily rejected by Turkey and continues to be a major roadblock in normalizing relationsWith its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey closed Armenia seeks to normalize relations with Ankara in hopes of facilitating greater trade and investment 2008 In Review  RFERL looks back at the stories that shaped

https://www.rferl.org/a/Seven_Prominent_Armenian_Oppositionists_On_Trial_/1361523.html,Seven Prominent Armenian Oppositionists On Trial ,"December 19, 2008 10:07 GMT",Seven prominent opposition figures are set to go on trial in Yerevan on charges of seeking to overthrow the government ,Seven prominent opposition figures are set to go on trial in Yerevan on charges of seeking to overthrow the government   The men were taken into custody in the wake of violent clashes between security forces and supporters of former President and opposition presidential candidate Levon TerPertrossian in March  For many in Armenia the charges are regarded as unsubstantiated even risible while parallel investigations into the events that culminated in the violence continue  Immediately after Armenias Central Election Commission announced early on February 20 that Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian won the previous days presidential ballot with over 52 percent of the vote supporters of TerPetrossian who according to official returns placed second with 215 percent congregated in Yerevans Freedom Square to protest the perceived rigging of the outcome TerPetrossian himself claimed to have polled no less than 65 percent   Violent ProtestsThe protests continued well into the early morning hours of March 1 when police moved in to disperse the participants by force When they reassembled on the evening of the same day the tensions escalated into open violence with individual protesters attacking police and security forces who in turn opened fire Eight people were killed in the clashes including two police officers two more died later of their injuries  Outgoing President Robert Kocharian imposed a 20day state of emergency and laid the blame for the violence squarely on TerPetrossian whom ProsecutorGeneral Aghvan Hovsepian subsequently accused of employing mass hypnosis on the demonstrators  Even before the violence of March 12 police had set about rounding up prominent members of TerPetrossians campaign staff The detainees included opposition Hanrapetutiun party member Suren Sureniants who was arrested on February 25 and spent two months in pretrial custody before a group of mostly progovernment legislators signed a petition calling for his release The charges against him which included inciting mass riots and attempting to seize power were quietly dropped in June due to lack of evidence RFERLs Armenian Service reported on June 13 Eyewitness Recounts March CrackdownLess fortunate was Harutiun Urutian who headed TerPetrossians campaign in the northern Shirak region He was sentenced in April to seven years in prison later reduced on appeal to six years on charges which he claimed were politically motivated of assaulting a member of Sarkisians campaign staff on polling day   Another TerPetrossian campaign official Hovannes Harutiunian was sentenced in April to 18 months imprisonment for illegal possession of ammunition Petros Makeyan head of the small Democratic Fatherland Party and Ashot Zakarian head of the Giumri chapter of the Yerkrapah Union of Veterans of the Karabakh War were jailed for three and 2 12 years respectively in June for obstructing the work of election precinct officials on February 19  In all more than 100 people were taken into custody either in the week leading up to March 12 or immediately after the violence TerPetrossians camp argues that at least 70 of them should be designated political prisoners As of midOctober 43 had been tried and sentenced to prison terms 37 received suspended sentences and five were acquitted according to a ProsecutorGenerals Office spokesperson quoted by Noyan Tapan   Jail Terms  Since midOctober two more prominent TerPetrossian loyalists have been sentenced to jail terms Former senior Interior Ministry official Mushegh Saghatelian was jailed for five years on October 23 and former Minister of State Revenues and Hanrapetutiun party member Sambat Ayvazian for two years on November 19 both on charges of violently resisting police   Ayvazians conviction was based solely on police testimony as was that of 19 of those sentenced earlier In a statement dated October 2 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE condemned that practice as unacceptable   The trial opened on September 1 and is still ongoing of former Deputy ProsecutorGeneral Gagik Djahangirian who publicly affirmed his support for TerPetrossian at a postelection rally on February 22   Djahangirian suffered what was termed an accidental gunshot wound when police stopped his car on the outskirts of Yerevan the following evening and arrested him He too is charged with seeking the violent overthrow of the incumbent regime   The opposition newspaper Chorrord ishkhanutiun commented on December 12 that the authorities have taken a differentiated approach to those arrested in connection with the postelection protests and are acting more harshly against people who were not in opposition prior to the 2008 presidential election race Supporters of TerPetrossian claimed their candidate had won the election  The paper suggests Kocharian and Sarkisian cannot forgive the latter for aligning with TerPetrossian and thereby dealing a serious blow to the ruling regime  International Criticism  The Armenian government initially remained impervious to repeated criticism from international organizations first of the conduct of the February 19 ballot then of the March 12 violence and finally of the court proceedings against TerPetrossian supporters   But in midJune the Armenian parliament established an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 12 violence It was initially envisaged that the commission would present its findings by October 25   On October 13 however its members formally asked the parliament to extend that deadline for two months in order to enable them to incorporate the findings of a smaller more independent factfinding group established in July under pressure from the PACE   TerPetrossian declined to nominate a representative to the parliamentary commission but his Armenian National Congress is represented on the independent body  In its October 2 statement PACE registered alarm and concern at the situation of those people still held in pretrial detention and the excessive length of the investigation and urged that they be brought to trial promptly   It also voiced doubts that some of those already sentenced had received a fair trial suggesting that at least some were convicted based on political beliefs and nonviolent activities and expressed regrets that the Armenian authorities did not consider the possibility of amnesty or pardons  The seven men whose trial begins on December 19 are Aleksandr Arzumanian who served under TerPetrossian as foreign minister and headed his campaign staff former progovernment parliament members Miasnik Malkhasian and Hakob Hakobian Sasun Mikayelian Suren Sirunian Shant Haroutiunian and Grigor Voskerchian All seven insist they are innocent of the charges against them which they consider politically motivated  PACE Human Rights Commissioner Thomas Hammarberg observed on a visit to Yerevan last month that I have not so far seen any strong evidence which would make it possible for an independent court to sentence these seven persons for attempting to change power in this country with violence  The imminent trial of the seven was one of the topics that Sarkisian discussed on December 16 with visiting OSCE SecretaryGeneral Marc Perrin de Brichambaut Also on December 16 parliament member Artsvik Minasian of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun which is part of the ruling fourparty coalition told journalists that Sarkisian may declare a general amnesty for all those sentenced to date whether or not they pled guilty   Such a gesture might defuse simmering tensions and preclude the possibility of new violent protests if the seven receive draconian sentences  On December 5 three men sentenced to jail terms ranging from three to 3 12 years for their participation in the March clashes were formally pardoned by Sarkisian after admitting their guilt RFERLs Armenian Service reported on December 8   And on December 17 it was announced that coup charges similar to those faced by the seven brought against four other prominent oppositionists  former Prime Minister Aram Sarkisian no relation to Serzh Ararat Zurabian and Karapet Rubinian both prominent members of TerPetrossians Armenian PanNational Movement and former deputy National Security Service head Gurgen Yeghiazarian  have been dropped for lack of evidence Aram Sarkisian was never taken into custody and the other three were released from detention several months ago

over a month now since the presidents of Armenia Azerbaijan and Russia signed in Moscow a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to resolving the longstanding NagornoKarabakh conflict exclusively by diplomatic means ,It is just over a month now since the presidents of Armenia Azerbaijan and Russia signed in Moscow a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to resolving the longstanding NagornoKarabakh conflict exclusively by diplomatic means The November 2 announcement reasserted the mediating role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Cooperation in Europes OSCE Minsk Group and took as the basis for further discussion the principles presented to the conflict sides in November 2007 in Madrid at the annual OSCE foreign ministers meetingOn December 4 at this years OSCE foreign ministers meeting in Helsinki the Russian and French foreign ministers and US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried representing the three countries that jointly cochair the Minsk Group issued a joint statement hailing the socalled Moscow Declaration as the beginning of a new and very promising phase in our joint effort to extend peace in the South CaucasusThey called on all sides to the conflict specifically referring to Armenia Azerbaijan and the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh republic which is not represented at the formal peace talks to take concrete measures within the next few months toward reaching agreement on the basic principles for resolving the conflict Specifically the three diplomats urged the parties to engage in confidencebuilding measures including the withdrawal by both sides of snipers deployed along the Line of Contact separating the Armenian and Azerbaijani armed forcesUS Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza who also serves as the US Minsk Group cochairman told RFERL in Helsinki that the cochairs and the conflict sides need to build on the momentum of the Moscow Declaration and specifically to see the basic principles finalized And we believe they can be soon he saidBryza said it is hoped that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will meet within a couple of weeks to formalize a rapprochement of their respective positions Fried speaking on December 5 was even more upbeat saying a settlement of the conflict has never been closerAzerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov however told journalists in Helsinki on December 5 that the next meeting between the Armenian and Azerbaijan presidents will take place only in early 2009 He also said the Minsk Group cochairs presented himself and his Armenian counterpart Eduard Nalbandian with unspecified amendments to the basic principles on which consensus was reached in Madrid last year Such a reference to amendments to the basic principles may be related to the confidencebuildingmeasures section of the Moscow Declaration especially as Azerbaijan has long withheld its agreement to such a provision In this regard the Moscow Declaration is doubly significant not only as the first document signed by the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents but also in terms of a new Azerbaijani recognition of the need for confidencebuilding measures which represents an important shift in Bakus longstanding positionThose socalled Madrid Principles are believed to comprise specific aspects of an earlier broader blueprint for resolving the conflict on which Armenia and Azerbaijan have reportedly already reached agreement with unresolved issues clearly designated as such That broader framework the original Basic Principles was made public in June 2006 It comprises a phasedpackage approach to resolving the conflict meaning that the various elements of a settlement are agreed on simultaneously even though they are implemented successively with one key aspect  the final status of the NagornoKarabakh republic  to be decided by a referendum or vote While the time frame for that referendum is not specified in the Basic Principles two of the cochairs have indicated that it is between 10 and 15 years after a comprehensive peace agreement is finalizedThe Basic Principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around NagornoKarabakh with special modalities for the Kelbacar and Lachin districts that separate Karabakh from Armenia All sides are required to renounce the use or threat of force the territories would be demilitarized and an international peacekeeping force deployed there based on an undefined mission mandate A referendum or popular vote would be agreed at an unspecified future date to determine the final legal status of NagornoKarabakh At present however the two sides remain far apart on the issue of who exactly would be eligible to participate International financial assistance would be made available for a wide range of postconflict development projects including demining reconstruction and resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the waraffected regions of NagornoKarabakhNew PrinciplesThe Azerbaijani website echoazcom published on November 13 what it claimed was the text of the Madrid Principles which differ from the Basic Principles in proposing an interim status for NagornoKarabakh until its final status is determined by a referendum The purported document also advocates enhancing the role of the EU special representative to the South Caucasus in liaising with the OSCE Minsk Group Neither the Minsk Group nor the Armenian or Azerbaijani government has either confirmed or denied the authenticity of that draft Meanwhile the Azerbaijani delegation in Helsinki has muddied the waters by circulating yet another set of principles that Baku apparently insists should be incorporated into the final settlement document As summarized on December 5 by dayaz those principles are based on the preservation of Azerbaijans territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders Crucially they stress that the military occupation meaning the occupation by Armenian armed forces of seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on NagornoKarabakh be decoupled from the rest of the peace processIn other words Azerbaijan insists that the process of determining the final status of NagornoKarabakh within Azerbaijan  a process that must take place with the direct complete and equal participation of both the present Armenian population of the enclave and its former Azerbaijani residents and on the basis of their constructive cooperation with the Azerbaijani government  may get under way only after the withdrawal of all Armenian forces from the seven occupied districtsThat renewed insistence that Armenia should effectively surrender its key bargaining chip the occupied territories without having obtained any comparable concession in return cannot but compound the apprehension of many in Armenia  including the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun that is a member of the coalition government  who fear an imminent sellout by President Serzh Sarkisian in the wake of the secret talks that preceded the historic visit to Armenia in early September by Turkish President Abdullah Gul The Moscow Declaration however sought to allay Armenian concerns over that approach The third point of that declaration commits the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1354244.html,Roundtable Is EU Choosing Stability Over Democracy In The South Caucasus ,"November 28, 2008 14:57 GMT",,Its been a rocky year in the South Caucasus Questionable elections in both Armenia and Azerbaijan ended with bloodshed in one and a dynasty digging in deeper in the other Georgia meanwhile is still reeling from a devastating war with Russia in August In a season when the region is looking west for guidance what role has the European Union played through all this As part of RFERLs Caucasus Crossroad program Russian Service broadcaster Yefim Fistein spoke to Leyla Yunus the director of the Bakubased Peace and Democracy Institute David Shahnazaryan of the Concord center for political and legal studies in Yerevan and Giorgi Gogsadze a professor of social and political studies at Tbilisi State University The roundtable was conducted on November 12RFERL Giorgi how satisfied are most Georgians with the role that the EU and especially French President Nicolas Sarkozy played in ending the RussiaGeorgia war Giorgi Gogsadze Overall you can say that the Georgian public reacted fairly positively to the way the EU and particularly Sarkozy reacted to the events in Georgia More time needs to pass before we can draw definite conclusions about how the EU acted or how it should be acting But everything thats taken place so far has gone according to plan The first stage is complete Russian forces have withdrawn from the buffer zone The second stage will be sending in EU and OSCE observers onto the territory of the conflict zone It seems to me that this second stage may become a drawnout process and this may cause a certain amount of frustrations among Georgians But Im hopeful that the EU will play a very important role and will be an active organization in this process That would be something we didnt see before the conflict EUs South Caucasus PolicyRFERL Leyla how have you seen the EUs policy evolve on the South Caucasus and Azerbaijan specifically Leyla Yunus In August we were all left with the distinct impression that we were defenseless against aggression from the north It was easy to predict that there was going to be a war of aggression by Russia against Georgia All the same there was no system of defense prepared whatsoever And after Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia the system of international security collapsed We had the feeling that any state could force its way over your border and legally occupy your territory I think the European Union should summon the political will it needs to create a system of defense for the countries of the South Caucasus and perhaps not only our countries from Russian aggression Azerbaijan like Georgia and Armenia is a member of the European Neighborhood Policy aimed at EU integration Before August we could feel at least a little movement on this  a little pressure on Azerbaijan to implement the plans requirements Now its perfectly plain that the European Commission and the EU members states are simply avoiding making any demands on the leadership of Azerbaijan regarding democracy human rights or the rule of law Theyre just steering clear of it So our president Ilham Aliyev has completely reoriented himself back toward Moscow Energy interests come first This is very very dangerous for our region RFERL You said that the EU is acting as though its indifference to the suppression of human rights will ensure them good ties with Aliyev But are there really those who believe the practice of suppressing human rights really guarantee stable relationsYunus That kind of system has existed in countries like Azerbaijan for many years already Azerbaijan has been a member of the Council of Europe since 2001 in 2006 it signed an action plan for the European Neighborhood Policy This action plan is not being fulfilled In April of this year the European Commission published its first report on what steps if any Azerbaijan had taken toward fulfilling the plan In the period it covered the year 2007 there were a record number of court cases against members of the media  103 Ten journalists serving jail sentences were named prisoners of conscience There were 95 physical attacks on journalists Not a single one of these numbers was mentioned in the report Thousands protested Armenian election results in February 2008In the chapter where they talked about things like freedom of assembly and a free press and judiciary they speak only in generalities We havent had the right to free assembly  like our neighbors in Georgia have for example  since 2005 But theres been absolutely no harsh criticism of Azerbaijan of any kind from either the EU or the Council of Europe Its a very nearsighted position The authoritarian regime that we have in Azerbaijan doesnt guarantee stability It doesnt guarantee democratic development if the political opposition is destroyed and there are no free democratic elections The society is becoming radicalized Radical viewpoints are developing regarding the Karabakh conflict RFERL David has the EU position on Armenia remained more or less the same Thousands protested Armenian election results in February 2008David Shahnazaryan Id put it more bluntly EU policy toward our region  all three countries  clings to a formula stability over all Stability is far more important than democracy There are a lot of facts to support this Some have already been mentioned Ill mention some that relate to my country Armenia currently has 75 political prisoners The EU in the form of the presidency twice spoke out after the February 19 presidential elections One of their demands was the immediate release of all political prisoners The leadership the illegitimate leadership in Armenia simply ignored this And the EU  pardon the expression  simply swallowed it clean as though nothing had happenedThe EU and some other international organizations also ignored the fact that the results of the Armenian elections were completely falsified And after the vote the authorities shot and killed innocent people On March 1 10 people were killed in Yerevan The European community  first and foremost the EU  closed their eyes to all that We demanded that an international investigation be conducted into those events but that met with no understanding in Brussels or the other European capitals In Armenia today theres this kind of ingrained conviction that European values may be one thing but that actual European structures are something completely different And we understand perfectly well that we will have to establish these European values without any help or support from the European structuresCzech EU PresidencyRFERL Many commentators say that Moscow wants to complete the talks before the next EU presidency begins on January 1 Moscow believes the current EU leadership under Sarkozy will be more accommodating than the Czech leadership that will follow Giorgi whats your opinion on this In particular about the ceasefire agreement A lot of people say problems were caused because Sarkozy didnt have a good understanding of the situation on the ground He didnt understand the difference between the territory of the two autonomous regions and that of the rest of Georgia As a result Russian forces sometimes ended up on Georgian territory Now in the Western press you sometimes see the idea of Russian forces pulling back to the territory of the two republics being confused with calls for Russian forces to leave Georgia entirely That is they are setting up the status quo before the war as the final status quo of the ceasefire Questions about changes to that status quo are not discussed The war in Georgia was a considerable challenge for EU policymakersGogsadze I dont agree with those experts The point is that in the agreement between Sarkozy and Medvedev it is clearly written that Russia must return to those points that existed before August 7 before the beginning of the conflict This concerns the number of forces and the location of the socalled peacekeepers But this is where things got stuck Russia now insists that there is a new reality that now that South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been recognized they must decide themselves who will be where and in what numbers And these republics now say they have agreed with Russia about the opening of military bases on the territories of these republics So now Russia is already manipulating a completely different reality And naturally Russia does not want to return to the status quo that existed before August 7 The European Union must stick firmly to its principles and it must pressure the Russian government to comply with all the points of the MedvedevSarkozy agreementRFERL But is it realistic to expect that Wont the EU give in to the pressure of the fait accompli that Russia is presentingGogsadze Of course theyll give in Some are saying the slogan is stability versus democracy I think its actually a case of energy versus democracy or even versus state sovereignty Im afraid that Old Europe will be on the side of stability  that is on the side of Russia But New Europe  meaning the former socialist bloc countries  they have been acting in a very principled way So it is no surprise that Russia is afraid of the Czech presidency of the EURFERL David how do people in Armenia feel about the efforts of several EU countries to ratify the Lisbon agreement and create a foreign ministers post for the bloc Would that make your relations easier or more difficultShahnazaryan I think this would definitely help because today most experts view the European Union as merely an economic formation that has no coherent foreign policy or security policy This is a common opinion and I think a justifiable one I think the creation of a foreign minister would help the EU work out a common foreign policy and a common security policy And I also really hope it will help turn attention away from the mistaken policy that stability trumps democracy Because we are already seeing the results of this policy in the South Caucasus where we have neither democracy nor stabilityEU DivisionsRFERL But isnt it likely that creating this post in the absence of a real united bloc will just mean that this person will be unable to make independent decisions Wouldnt such a system mean wed stop hearing the voices of the new members and hear only the voices of those who dont want to place principles and values above pragmatic concerns Yunus Here the best hope lies in the PolishSwedish Eastern Partnership initiative If the Poles alone had put forth this initiative  which is a new project for the EUs work with the countries of the South Caucasus plus Moldova and Ukraine and possibly Belarus  maybe it would have seemed like well just the Poles But it is a PolishSwedish initiative and Germany has since moved to support it Now its already being discussed as an adopted project and its possible that in December a structure to implement the project will be created This all indicates that a door  or at least a small window  has been opened a bit and its possible to put forward initiatives I agree with my colleagues from Georgia and Armenia that the current policies of the European Union are not only ineffective but also very shortsighted How can we talk about stability in the South Caucasus after August How can we talk about stability when the ArmeniaAzerbaijan conflict is on the edge of erupting Today we have no protection from outside aggression or from terrorist acts And the main thing is that in the countries of the South Caucasus  and Im talking first of all about my country Azerbaijan  an Asiantype despotism has been established Our citizens have lost the ability to elect their leaders in a peaceful political process  legislative executive etc Our last elections were basically a rebirth of the Soviet Union In such circumstances when people hear various commissars who come in from Brussels talk about partnership they are extremely skeptical As a result the authority of liberal values is in decline among the population of the country And this is very dangerous In this situation I think that it is vital to demonstrate political will and a unified policy on the part of all the countries of the European Union in relation to the geopolitically important region of the South CaucasusRFERL I personally wonder just how important stability in the South Caucasus is for the countries of Western Europe and to what extent their perception of the South Caucasus is skewed by their energy dependence on Russia Unlike Azerbaijan Georgia has no oil but perhaps for Georgia economic cooperation with Europe is of vital significance and could help overcome the economic boycott imposed by Russia Is this aspect taken into account during discussions of the role the EU could play in GeorgiaGogsadze Georgia has not suffered seriously from the impact of the economic blockade Russia imposed several years ago but has nonetheless managed to move forward despite those restrictions Perhaps the reason for Russias aggression toward Georgia is that since economic pressure had no effect Russia switched to military means Relations with Europe and in particular economic cooperation are without doubt a key priority for Georgia but as of today the primary question is that of stability and state sovereignty I dont mean territorial integrity but sovereignty and this sovereignty either exists or it doesnt For that reason the Europeans and the Americans and the entire international community should adopt an absolutely principled stand on defending the sovereignty of independent states in order to prevent the emergence of new hotspots and regions of instability RFERL The recording of this discussion coincides with the EURussia summit in Nice eds held November 14 The EU wants that summit to focus on the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia while Russia wants to discuss a new strategic partnership agreement with the EU Poland and Lithuania wanted to make discussion of the second contingent on discussion of the first while the countries of Western Europe for the most part tried so to speak to twist the Lithuanians arm and dissuade them from taking that approach How do the prospects for its success appear from the vantage point of the South CaucasusShahnazaryan To be frank I very much fear that despite that pressure from the new EU member states Old Europe will prevail and Lithuania and the other countries will not succeed in defending not their own interests but a system of values and democracy As for Russias role and its influence in the South Caucasus it is my firm conviction that after the August events Russia is now irrevocably withdrawing from the South Caucasus This withdrawal creates an extremely explosive situation for us in the sense that the old world is receding and whenever Russia withdraws it leaves nothing but ruins behindI think all three South Caucasus states should work together to ensure that this Russian retreat should be as painless as possible After what happened in Georgia this is the beginning of the end of the Russian presence in the South Caucasus because Russia retains a foothold in the region only thanks to the NagornoKarabakh conflict and the fact that ArmenianTurkish relations are closed As a result of what happened in August a new era has begun an era which I would call that of Russias withdrawal from the South CaucasusRFERL I would agree with you that sometimes national leaders seek to portray a withdrawal as the beginning of a new era The question here is whether Russia has the means at its disposal to implement President Dmitry Medvedevs new doctrine that affirms Russias privileged interests including in the South Caucasus But how has the global economic crisis which has impacted on Europe no less than on Russia affected AzerbaijanYunus I would say that after August we have the impression that Russia is not retreating from the South Caucasus but returning You may not have noticed but the Azerbaijani leadership maintained constant contact with Moscow and after Dick Cheneys visit to Baku in early September Ilham Aliyev immediately traveled to Moscow Azerbaijans political elite is economically tied to Russia The money we receive for Azerbaijans oil goes to the ruling family while the population at large subsists on money sent by Azerbaijani migrant workers in Russia So that if the entire economy goes into decline as happened in 1998 and the flow of cash from Russia to families in Azerbaijan decreases the Azerbaijani economy will face major difficulties no two ways about it At present Azerbaijan is Europes only alternative supplier of energy If Azerbaijan were to become closely integrated with the EU and the EU in turn guaranteed Azerbaijans security and integrated not only Azerbaijan but the entire South Caucasus and if the process of trying to resolve the NagornoKarabakh conflict took place within the framework of that process of integration with the EU and if we were safe from aggression from the north then Azerbaijan would really have an interest in channeling its energy resources to Europe via Georgia or Armenia But as things are today I think that the EU is dragging its feet and therefore its possible Azerbaijan may orient itself totally toward RussiaRFERL I suspect the EU is suffering from enlargement fatigue and dreads the prospect of Turkey and possibly also the South Caucasus states becoming membersYunus Im not talking about EU membership but about whether its more expensive to drop bombs than to provide economic assistance to develop civil societyRFERL Georgia is dead set on joining NATO Why is it not devoting the same energy to integration with the EUGogsadze Georgia is indeed active on that front even though the Europeans have made it clear to us that for the next 15 years or so Europes doors will remain closed not only to Georgia but to the other South Caucasus states I think this was the biggest mistake on the part of the EU because any alliance or any country that does not dream of extending its territory is doomed to perish

Moscow on November 2 the presidents of Armenia Azerbaijan and Russia signed a document pledging their continued commitment to resolving the Karabakh conflict peacefully It was the first time that officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan had signed such a joint document since Russia mediated a ceasefire agreement in 1994 putting an end to one of the deadliest wars in the former USSR,Meeting in Moscow on November 2 the presidents of Armenia Azerbaijan and Russia signed a document pledging their continued commitment to resolving the Karabakh conflict peacefully It was the first time that officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan had signed such a joint document since Russia mediated a ceasefire agreement in 1994 putting an end to one of the deadliest wars in the former USSRThe socalled Moscow Declaration of Intent on NagornoKarabakh was an important diplomatic event in the 15year long negotiating process But it was much more important for Moscow which thus reminded everyone that it holds the key to a solution to this conflict The joint declaration was cosigned only by Russia despite the fact that other two Minsk Group cochairs the United States and France were also present A closer look at the declaration leaves no doubt that much of what was discussed during the closeddoor talks was not reflected on paper The declaration is just another expression of intent by the two leaders that they are serious about seeking a peaceful solution and that the military option can no longer be considered an alternative to peaceful diplomacyIn short both sides agreed on paper to tone down harsh military rhetoric and expedite the peace process However taking the text at face value would be overly optimistic Questions AriseEvery time Russia steps up its mediation efforts questions arise about its motives for doing so The simple answer in this case would probably be that it wants at least to preserve the level of influence that it had in Armenia and more importantly in Azerbaijan which has long been suspicious about its real intentions in the regionNow that Georgia is out of the Russian sphere of influence at least for the foreseeable future Moscow will do all in its power to keep the two remaining South Caucasus countries Armenia and Azerbaijan under its control The only way to do that is to act as an honest broker to bring about a settlement of the frozen and potentially deadly Karabakh conflict Moscows mediation could also be seen as an attempt to restore its credibility in the region following the war with Georgia which further eroded its relations with the United States Depending on who wins the US presidential election Moscow will try to showcase its good behavior to the new leadership in Washington There is one important line in the joint declaration which shows that Moscow will not mediate the potential peace deal alone bypassing its American and French partners in the OSCE Minsk Group The declaration clearly states that the peace process will proceed within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group based on the Madrid Principles endorsed by the OSCE Ministerial Council which envisage the return of occupied Azerbaijani territories and the possibility of holding a referendum on the future status of NagornoKarabakh High ExpectationsIt is hard to imagine that a Karabakh peace deal could be achieved without the United States one of the major players in the OSCE Minsk Group Azerbaijan and Armenia will not easily bow to Moscows pressure without the approval of the new administration in Washington It would therefore be premature to expect a breakthrough in the talks before January 2009 when the next US president is sworn inArmenians have high expectations for Democratic Senator Barack Obama hoping that if he is elected president he will support their causeI will promote Armenian security by seeking an end to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades and by working for a lasting and durable settlement of the NagornoKarabakh conflict that is agreeable to all parties Obama said in one of his campaign promises to ArmenianAmericansThe Armenian government will seek help from the United States if it is pressured to give up Azerbaijani territories without obtaining guarantees that the NagornoKarabakh Armenians will be able to hold a referendum on their future status Some experts in Azerbaijan and Armenia believe that Russia might try to secure a substantial military presence in the conflict zone as part of the future peacekeeping force that is to be deployed once a peace agreement is signed Azerbaijan will most probably seek support from the United States in ensuring that Russian troops do not return to AzerbaijanThe Georgian experience has demonstrated that once they come they are unlikely to leave

https://www.rferl.org/a/Russia_To_Host_Talks_Between_Armenian_Azerbaijani_Presidents/1337251.html,Russia To Host Talks Between Armenian Azerbaijani Presidents ,"November 01, 2008 14:25 GMT",The announcement on October 29 that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will meet in Moscow on November 2 at the invitation of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to discuss ways to resolve the Karabakh conflict has fueled speculation about an imminent breakthrough in the peace process,The announcement on October 29 that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will meet in Moscow on November 2 at the invitation of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to discuss ways to resolve the Karabakh conflict has fueled speculation about an imminent breakthrough in the peace processMedvedev offered during a visit to Yerevan on October 21 to host such a meeting between the two leaders But while all sides have publicly affirmed that the August war between Georgia and Russia has demonstrated the futility and risks inherent in trying to resolve conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union by military force the Armenian and Azerbaijani negotiating positions still remain far apart on several key pointsTrue a framework agreement for resolving the Karabakh conflict already exists in the form of the Madrid Principles presented by the French US and Russian Minsk Group cochairmen to the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Madrid in November 2007 That blueprint in turn was based on the Basic Principles for the Peaceful Solution of the NagornoKarabakh Conflict that were made public in June 2006The Basic Principles envisage the phased withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territories contiguous to NagornoKarabakh including the district of Kelbacar and the strategic Lachin Corridor that links Armenia and the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR the demilitarization of those previously occupied territories the deployment of an international peacekeeping force demining reconstruction and other measures to address the impact of the conflict and expedite the return to their homes of displaced persons and finally a referendum among the NKR population to determine the regions future status visavis the central Azerbaijani government in BakuRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by Rossiiskaya gazeta on October 7 as saying the two sides have reached agreement on all but two or three key points of the Madrid Principles and that there is a very real chance of resolving the conflict Lavrov added that the main obstacle is lack of consensus on the future of the Lachin CorridorSticking PointsA second problematic issue is that of Karabakhs future status Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev reiterated on October 24 during his inauguration for a second presidential term that Azerbaijan will never agree to concede part of its territory Karabakh will never be independent news agencies quoted him as saying Azerbaijan will never recognize it Neither in five years nor in 10 20 years NeverAliyevs Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian for his part told Armenian Public Television on October 27 following a visit to NagornoKarabakh during which he toured the heavily militarized Line of Contact between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces east of the NKR that a resolution of the NagornoKarabakh conflict is possible if Azerbaijan recognizes the right of the people of NagornoKarabakh to selfdetermination if NagornoKarabakh has a land border with Armenia and if international organizations and leading nations guarantee the security of the people of NagornoKarabakhSarkisian also stressed on October 27 that Armenia continues to regard the ongoing talks chaired by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europes OSCE Minsk Group as the sole forum for resolving the conflict Turkish President Abdullah Guls muchpublicized offer during his visit to Yerevan on September 7 to assist in reaching a solution has been widely construed as a bid by Ankara to muscle in on the peace process The French Minsk Group cochair Ambassador Bernard Fassier has vehemently denied any such Turkish intentYerevanbased US analyst Richard Giragosian too sees Medvedevs initiative as intended to counter and challenge a bid by Turkey to promote itself as a guarantor of stability in the South Caucasus But even more important Giragosian says is Moscows clear commitment to working together with Washington to achieving a solution to the conflictIt is a sign that Russia remains committed to the ongoing OSCE Minsk Group peace process seeking a negotiated solution to NagornoKarabakh and most importantly despite the fact that this presidential summit is being hosted by the Russians it is a demonstration and affirmation that the US and Russia still share the same goals of pursuing the Minsk Group process and trying to negotiate a solution to this last frozen conflict in the South Caucasus Giragosian saysThe US and Russia do have areas of cooperation do have areas where they could work together and in many ways it is in Russias interest to maintain at least the status quo regarding NagornoKarabakh Giragosian adds and both the US and Russia remain committed to preventing any new escalation or outbreak of hostilities especially to prevent Azerbaijan from trying to solve this unresolved conflict militarilyFrom that point of view therefore simply hosting the summit may be perceived in Moscow as more important than any actual outcomeSpeculation about a breakthrough in the peace process has focused not on the status issue but the question of deploying international peacekeepers in the Lachin Corridor and the regions of Azerbaijan bordering the NKR that are currently controlled by Armenian forces Some analysts have suggested Russia could insist that its 58th Army take on those responsibilities But Armenian Defense Minister Colonel General Seyran Ohanian told the Armenian newspaper IravunkDe Facto on October 31 that any peacekeeping force will not be 100 percent RussianMeanwhile concern is growing in Armenia that Sarkisian might be constrained to make a major concession possibly on the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory without securing any tangible benefits in return The Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD released a statement on October 31 warning that it will quit the coalition government if Sarkisian betrays national interests by agreeing to cede those territoriesThe day before on October 30 a group of prominent Armenian intellectuals and public figures announced the launch of a new movement named Unification National Initiative that will actively oppose any territorial concessions to

https://www.rferl.org/a/The_US_Election__Views_From_RFERLs_Region/1336518.html,The US Election  Views From RFERLs Region ,"Last Updated: November 03, 2008 12:56 GMT",Its only US citizens wholl be casting votes this week to choose a successor to President George W Bush,Its only US citizens wholl be casting votes this week to choose a successor to President George W BushBut the rest of the world will be watching with avid interest to see if voters elect Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama the first AfricanAmerican nominee from a major partyAs the United States heads into the November 4 election RFERL asked analysts from Iran to Moldova what the vote might mean for their countriesIranPolitical scientist Sadegh Zibakalam of the University of TehranSadegh ZibakalamIf Mr Obama is elected depending on reactions from Iran towards possible US flexibility on negotiating with Iran we may observe certain changes in IranUS relations Obviously both sides will move very cautiously but overall I dont think the situation will be worse than what it is nowIf Mr McCain is elected we will probably observe a sort of continuation of the last two terms of President Bush That means for example pressure on Iran on the nuclear issue will rise and more sanctions will be appliedIraqAnalyst Omar alMashhadaniI think US foreign policy remains consistent irrespective of who may be the White House resident What we have is a state run by institutions rather than a personalized administration It is neither George Bush nor Obama or McCain but strategic and organizational institutions that run the country especially in foreign policy As for Iraqs interests and what may be harmful or favorable to these interests there is no doubt that US interests are above all else regardless of the nominees or the presidents position which is quite appropriate I think that even statements made by Obama about withdrawal from Iraq to withdraw troops within 16 months of taking office are meant for the media and it will be different once he sits in the Oval Office The security pact being talked about these days under which US troops would leave Iraq by the end of 2011 is a case in point The coming administration will be bound by this agreement Neither Obama nor anyone else can change what George Bush has signedRussiaEconomist Mikhail DelyaginMikhael DelyaginWith any president the US president will no longer be a lame duck America will show its elbows it will pursue an active policy which has been forgotten about The United States will return to the direct struggle for global leadership And for us it will be quite a significant problem for the ideology under which Russia has been getting back on its feet Whatever happens Pakistan will be chaotic and there will be destabilization of the world order in general Whatever happens there will be opposition between China and the United States in which Russia will have to find an intermediate position We will have to lead or at least become members of a new nonaligned movement in order to be friends with both parties But making friends with the two rival parties will require quite a bit of skill and great energy which we still unfortunately do not haveKazakhstanIndependent political analyst Aydos SarymThere are mistaken assumptions among the Kazakh authorities that if Obama wins then it will be easier for the Kazakh government and if McCain wins then it will be tough for the Kazakh government But all of these assumptions are wrong They are simply mere words The United States is a country where the government has been implementing a consistent foreign policy and it does not matter if the Democrats or the Republicans come to power As far as human rights and democracy are concerned I think that it would not be easy for our regime in any caseTajikistanPolitical analyst Abdughaffori KamolFor many years power in the United States has changed between Democrats and Republicans But except for some domestic economic problems or other domestic problems in foreign policy they have pursued the same strategy Two years ago George Bush said that the policies of the United States were determined 2530 years ago and that the administration is only implementing them Therefore I dont think that for example Barack Obama will introduce some changes in relations with such a small country as Tajikistan The current political policy of the United States will be continued after the presidential election They could make only very small changes in the field of investment like to increase or decrease its level and thats all But if we take into consideration that Barack Obama supports the policy of increasing the level of troops in Afghanistan with the aim of destroying the nest of terrorism and eradicating drug cultivation in that country if we look from that point I think they could give more attention to Tajikistan and the security measures in Afghanistan would be strengthenedArmeniaAnalyst Richard GiragosianThe US presidential election is widely interpreted as a turning point in US foreign policy This contest in many ways more than any US election in many years promises to usher in a significantly new period of challenges and choices for America no matter who becomes the next US president After eight years of the Bush administration the next president faces a difficult inheritance  a massive deficit a serious financial crisis and lingering problems in both Iraq and Afghanistan Richard GiragosianIn this way no matter who wins the election it is clear that the new leader will have to embark on a serious course correction simply to contain the damage already inflicted on US power and credibility While such a shift in US foreign policy will include a broad reassessment in all areas US policy regarding the South Caucasus will also need to address the recent reassertion of Russian power and influence a trend that has only been reinforced by the aftermath of the Georgian conflict this past August From a narrower perspective however the postGeorgia shift in the regional landscape will necessitate a modification of US policy toward Armenia based on a new recognition that domestic politics and economics matter much more than the grander context of geopolitics And for the incoming US administration the case of Armenia will pose a new challenge between more aggressively pressuring the embattled Armenian leadership which is also seriously hobbled by a lack of legitimacy and the more traditional emphasis on gradual evolutionary change Yet the imperative for the United States is to no longer remain silent or timid in the face of unacceptable deficiencies in democracy in countries like Armenia or even Azerbaijan especially because the real key to lasting stability in these countries lies in holding their leaders more accountable to their own people and to meeting international standards and normsUkraineOleh Bilorus chairman of parliaments Foreign Policy Committee and a former Ambassador to WashingtonWe expect that the United States as a superpower the global leader will influence other countries including those that refrained from supporting a MAP NATO Membership Action Plan for Ukraine There is no doubt that the United States supports Ukraine but there is Germany and other countries that have doubts I think that in December this issue will be reconsidered After NATOs April summit in Bucharest there is no choice but to offer Ukraine a MAP Oleh Bilorus MoldovaCommunist Vladimir Turcan leader of parliaments Judicial CommitteeUS foreign policy is very stable so I do not think that elections will bring any fundamental changes We hope that the United States will continue to treat us and our position in a fair way the same attitude we expect from Russia including in the Transdniester problem Moldovas Russianspeaking breakaway region Weve already said that by now this conflict is a regional one it is even a conflict at the crossroads of geopolitical interestsOleg Serebria an opposition leader in parliamentA victory for Republican McCain will put the countries in our region in a better position because McCain knows very well the problem of the Black Sea region he has a very well defined and strict position toward Russia and its policy in the Black Sea region and generally in Southeast Europe I think Obama will have different priorities in foreign policy Southeast Europe will not be part of it he already signaled that his policy towards Russia will be more conciliatory and that one of his priorities will be NorthSouth not EastWest relations as a consequence our country might be put aside

served to highlight the destabilizing potential of unresolved conflicts in the Caucasus and thus lent a new urgency to ongoing efforts to find a solution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict ,The brief August war between Georgia and Russia served to highlight the destabilizing potential of unresolved conflicts in the Caucasus and thus lent a new urgency to ongoing efforts to find a solution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict Speaking on October 21 during a visit to Yerevan Russian President Dmitry Medvedev argued that one of the lessons to be drawn from the fighting over South Ossetia is that such conflicts can and must be resolved peacefully through negotiations To that end Medvedev offered to host a summit in Moscow early next month between Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and his newly reelected Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev in order to seek a solution to the Karabakh conflict based on international principles Basic Principles The September visit to Yerevan by Turkish President Abdullah Gul fuelled hopes for a normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia that could in turn facilitate an accord on Karabakh At the same time some analysts construed Guls statement that Ankara is ready to help mediate such a solution as a bid possibly supported by Russia to sideline the OSCEs Minsk Group And some political figures in Yerevan fear that under pressure from both Russia and the West Sarkisian might agree to compromises they consider unacceptable and detrimental to Armenias longterm interests  A framework agreement for resolving the Karabakh conflict already exists in the form of the socalled Madrid Principles presented by the French US and Russian Minsk Group cochairmen to the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Madrid in November 2007

Azerbaijani government in Baku  Meeting for the first time on the sidelines of a CIS summit in St Petersburg in June Sarkisian and Aliyev gave the green light for their respective foreign ministers to continue talks on ways to resolve the conflict on the basis of the Madrid Principles Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who traveled to Yerevan in early October for talks with Sarkisian and Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian was quoted by Rossiiskaya gazeta on October 7 as saying that all three cochairs see a very real chance of resolving the conflict assuming that agreement can be reached on the two or three still unresolved issues Lavrov added that the main obstacle is lack of consensus on the future of the Lachin corridor The Azerbaijani website dayaz back on April 1 quoted Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov as saying Azerbaijan has no objections to both Armenia and Azerbaijan using the corridor provided it remains territorially a part of Azerbaijan  Resolution Hopes Visiting Yerevan on October 17 US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried was even more upbeat than Lavrov He told RFERLs Armenian Service that a breakthrough in the conflictresolution process in the coming weeks is possible given that the war in Georgia reminded everyone in this region how terrible war is and thus made a resumption of hostilities less likely But Fried went on possible does not mean inevitable and there are hard decisions that have to be made on both sides If this conflict were easy to resolve it would have been resolved already  Fried did not mention any heightened role for Turkey in the peace process But meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian no relation to Serzh in Washington on October 14 US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice discounted speculation that the Minsk Group would be superseded as the mediating body  Speaking to journalists in Yerevan on September 17 French Minsk Group coChairman Bernard Fassier similarly sought to dispel the perception that Turkey was seeking to torpedo the work of the Minsk Group Fassier explained that since Turkey is one of the 12 members of the OSCE Minsk Group its efforts directed at providing assistance to the settlement of the Karabakh conflict do not imply a change in the format of negotiations He said that Turkey has always shown a constructive approach supporting the activities of the three cochairmen and that any proposal made to support the negotiations in particular from Turkey is desirable and welcome RFERLs Armenian Service reportedClick map to enlarge

part of a broader effort to minimize Russian influence in the South Caucasus RFERLs Armenian Service reported TerPetrossian accused President Sarkisian after whom according to official returns he polled second in the February 19 presidential ballot of being ready to put Karabakh up for sale and renounce Armenias longstanding political and military alliance with Russia in an effort to

reflects a real crisis in the world order and risks triggering a dangerous recurrence of past mistakes Suffice the testimony of nearly all global and regional actors which have quickly shifted gears and embarked on a collective reassessment of their respective strategic interests and to that end a diversification of policy priorities and political partnerships,The recent race of strategic realignments reflects a real crisis in the world order and risks triggering a dangerous recurrence of past mistakes Suffice the testimony of nearly all global and regional actors which have quickly shifted gears and embarked on a collective reassessment of their respective strategic interests and to that end a diversification of policy priorities and political partnershipsIt matters little whether this geopolitical scramble was directly triggered by the RussianGeorgian war and the resulting collapse of standing paradigms for the Caucasus or whether it crowned latently simmering scenarios in the halls of international power The fact is that the great game  for strategic resources control over communications and routes of transit and longterm leverage  is on again with renewed vigor selfserving partisanship and duplicitous entanglementOne of the hallmarks of this unbrave new world is the apparent reciprocal rediscovery of Russia and Turkey Whatever its motivations and manifestations Turkeys play behind the back of its transAtlantic bulwark and Russias dealings at the expense of its strategic ally Armenia raise the specter of a replay of the events of more than 85 years ago when Bolshevik Russia and a Kemalist Turkey not content with the legacy of the great Genocide and National Dispossession of 1915 partitioned the Armenian homeland in MolotovRibbentrop fashion and to its future detrimentTime To Face UpNagornoKarabakh Artsakh in Armenian was one of the territorial victims of this 1921 plot of the pariahs as it was placed under Soviet Azerbaijani suzerainty together with Nakhichevan That latter province of the historical Armenian patrimony was subsequently cleansed of its majority Armenian population and then of its Armenian cultural heritage As recently as December 2005 Azerbaijan like Armenia a member of the Council of Europe completed the total Talibanstyle annihilation of the medieval Armenian cemetery at Jugha that contained thousands of unique crossstonesNagornoKarabakh by contrast was able to turn the tide on a past of genocide dispossession occupation and partition and defend its identity integrity and territory against foreign aggression In 1991  long before Kosovo South Ossetia and Abkhazia became buzzwords  it declared its liberty decolonization and sovereignty in compliance with the Montevideo standards of conventional international law and with the Soviet legislation in force at that time Subsequent international recognition of Kosovo on the one hand and the later withholding of such recognition for South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other demonstrate that there exists no real rule of law applied evenly across the board On the contrary such decisions are dictated by vital interests that are rationalized by reference to selectively interpreted international legal principles of choice and exclusivist distinctions of fact which in fact make no differenceIts time to face up to the farce  and that goes for Moscow and Ankara too judging by recent pronouncements by highlevel officials And if the two countries are driven by the desire for a strategic new compact then at least their partners on the world stage should reshift gears and calibrate their policy alternatives accordingly Iran the United States and its European allies might find here an objective intersection of their concernsWhat Is NeededRussia and Turkey must never again find unity of purpose at the expense of Armenia and the Armenian people The track record of genocide exile death camps and gulags is enough for all eternityThese two important countries as partners both real and potential must respect the Armenian nations tragic history its sovereign integrity and modern regional role and NagornoKarabakhs lawfully gained freedom and independenceFootball diplomacy is fine but Turkey can rise to the desired new level of global leadership and local legitimacy only by dealing with Armenia from a platform of good faith and reconciliation through truth lifting its illegal blockade of the republic and opening the frontier that it unilaterally closed instead of using it as a bargaining tool establishing diplomatic relations without preconditions and working through that relationship to build mutual confidence and give resolution to the many watershed issues dividing the two neighbors accepting and atoning following the brilliant example of postWorld War II Germany for the first genocide of the 20th century and the national dispossession that attended it committing to rebuild restore and then celebrate the Armenian national heritage from Mount Ararat and the medieval capital city of Ani to the vast array of churches monasteries schools academies fortresses and other cultural treasures of the ancestral Armenian homelands initiating and bringing to fruition a comprehensive program to guarantee the right of secure voluntary return for the progeny and descendants of the dispossessed to their places and properties of provenance providing full civil human and religious rights to the Armenian community of Turkey including the total abolition the infamous Article 301 which has served for so long as an instrument of fear suppression and even death with regard to those courageous citizens of good conscience who dare to proclaim the historical fact of genocide and finally exercising

pressure from the international community the Armenian parliament set up an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 12 clashes in Yerevan between supporters of defeated presidential candidate Levon TerPetrossian and security forces that resulted in 10 deaths ,In midJune under pressure from the international community the Armenian parliament set up an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 12 clashes in Yerevan between supporters of defeated presidential candidate Levon TerPetrossian and security forces that resulted in 10 deaths It was initially envisaged that the commission would present its findings by October 25 On October 13 however its members formally asked parliament to extend that deadline for two months to enable them to incorporate the findings of a smaller more independent factfinding group that is to conduct a parallel investigationThe conduct of an independent transparent and credible inquiry into the postelection violence was one of the key demands addressed to the Armenian authorities by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE in a resolution adopted in midApril But following a visit to Yerevan in July Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg proposed the creation of the alternative factfinding group RFERLs Armenian Service on July 16 quoted former Justice Minister David Harutiunian who heads the Armenian PACE delegation as explaining that Hammarberg wanted the collection of facts and evidence relating to the violence to be a separate process entrusted to the new body while the ad hoc parliamentary commission would merely deliver a political evaluation based on those findings Harutiunian said the new body should consist exclusively of apolitical experts who enjoy public trust Experts who would be chosen by all political forcesThe ad hoc commission was initially to include two parliament deputies from each faction and one independent deputy giving a total of at least eight progovernment lawmakers and two opposition representatives But on June 19 it decided also to invite to participate in its work all political forces that received at least 3 percent of the popular vote during the May 2007 parliamentary elections but less than the minimum 5 percent needed to win seats in the National Assembly as well as defeated candidates in the February 19 presidential elections including TerPetrossian or their representativesBoth TerPetrossian and Zharangutiun Heritage the sole opposition party represented in parliament decided against participating in the work of the ad hoc commission however arguing that it would not prove capable of delivering an independent and objective assessment of events On October 2 Zharangutiun faction member Vardan Khachatrian denounced the findings of the ad hoc commission to date as a farce intended to exonerate the authorities of any responsibility for the deaths and injuries Noyan Tapan reportedKhachatrian also said on October 2 that Zharangutiun plans to launch an independent probe with the specific intention of answering the asyetopen question who issued the order to security forces to open fire on the protesters He said Zharangutiun will nominate a representative to the new smaller body which will reportedly comprise two representatives each from the government and from the opposition plus an expert from the office of human rights ombudsman Armen Harutiunian no relation to David who incurred criticism from outgoing President Robert Kocharian in April for his trenchant and objective 80page report on the chain of events that culminated in the March violence Other opposition parties have not yet commented on the planned new probeThe Armenian authorities have also asked foreign governments and international organizations to nominate representatives to the new factfinding group but to date only the United States has done so dispatching to Yerevan last week three experts who participated in an independent inquiry into the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks The three held discussions with members of the ad hoc commission one of them met on October 7 with ProsecutorGeneral Aghvan Hovsepian who went on record in March as attributing the violence to TerPetrossians use of mass hypnosis and other psychological tricks on his supportersSpeaking to journalists on October 13 ad hoc commission member Artashes Shahbazian of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun one of the four parties in the coalition government appealed to the opposition to provide materials for the ongoing investigation If you have facts that you think we are trying to conceal I ask you to publicize or present them Noyan Tapan quoted him as sayingIt is not clear whether the Armenian authorities delay in setting up the alternative factfinding group proposed by Hammarberg was the result of inertia or a deliberate attempt to prolong the investigation beyond the original October 25 deadline But the continued uncertainty benefits the authorities insofar as it provides a pretext for keeping in pretrial detention several prominent TerPetrossian associates arrested in the wake of the March violence including former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzumanian

twopronged diplomatic strategy by the EU and the United States is very evident in the South Caucasus this week and shows what the division of labor between Brussels and Washington will beThe EU has its sights set on the short term Trying to exploit whatever influence it has with Moscow Brussels aim is to get the Russian troops to pull back from as much of Georgian territory as possibleThe United States on the other hand is focusing on the longerterm objective of shoring up the resolve of the governments in the region to stand up to Moscow It believes Azerbaijan is key to this effortThe EU on October 1 formally launched its 340strong monitoring mission in Georgia Armored cars carrying unarmed EU observers set out from their bases with the aim of entering the socalled buffer zone set up by Russian troops outside the administrative borders of South Ossetia and AbkhaziaIn Tbilisi for the inauguration of the monitoring mission EU foreignpolicy chief Javier Solana on September 30 reiterated the blocs view that Russia has committed itself to withdrawing its troops from the buffer zone within 10 days of the observers deploymentI hope very much that by the end of October 10 that Russian forces will be withdrawn Solana said That is the aim that we have and that is at least for the first part the obligation that we have from the agreement And wed like very much to see that doneComplications From Both SidesUnfortunately for the EU its observer mission had trouble gaining access to the areas in Georgian proper that are still controlled by Russian soldiersMoscow is obliged to cease all military activity outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia under the terms of an agreement it signed with the EU on September 8 That agreement modifies an earlier accord reached on August 12 which allowed Russia to carry out additional security measures in Georgia outside Abkhazia and South OssetiaThe August 12 agreement also stipulates that an international conference will be convened in Geneva on October 15 to discuss the stability and security of South Ossetia and AbkhaziaPreparations for the conference have been fraught with difficulty Russia insists on the full presence of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian authorities  both of which it has recognized as independent countries Georgia on the other hand vehemently rejects any arrangements that could be seen as conferring independent status on either regionAs a result the first talks on October 15 will be lowkey featuring junior ministers from Georgia and Russia as well as mediators from the EU They will be preceded on October 14  also in Geneva  by a summit of top officials from the United Nations OSCE EU and the United StatesPresident Mikheil Saakashvili indicated last month that Tbilisi is prepared to talk to the separatists about refugees but not the status of the regionsThe next stage is and a parallel stage is returning internally displaced persons in secure and dignified conditions getting internationalization of the process  but not of the status I have to say the process  and getting Russians out of Georgias territory deoccupation of Georgia because these are right now territories occupied by a foreign military power against the will of the government of a sovereign independent country Saakashvili saidTo complicate matters further Georgia has launched criminal proceedings against the Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaderships accusing them of high treason and banditryRegional ConfidenceBuildingWhile the United States has remained on the sidelines in Georgia Deputy Undersecretary of State John Negropontes visit to Azerbaijan is the second in recent weeks by a senior US official In early September Vice President Dick Cheney was reportedly given a cool reception by Baku but this appears not to have put off WashingtonWith considerable gas and oil reserves of its own Azerbaijan holds the only viable transit route between Central Asia and Europe that bypasses Russia Without Bakus cooperation the EUs projected Nabucco pipeline between bringing Caspian hydrocarbons through Turkey to Austria would be doomed  and Russias grip on the EUs energy supplies would tightenAzerbaijan and Armenia have adopted a waitandsee posture in the aftermath of the Russian tour de force in Georgia in early AugustWestern diplomats say Azerbaijans selfconfidence which had been buoyed by the huge windfall profits it was making from oil and gas has been visibly dented Along with it were the shortterm hopes it may have entertained about retaking NagornoKarabakh from Armenia by forceArmenia forced into an uneasy alliance with Russia because of its standoff with Azerbaijan is now worried it may itself become a target for Moscow Yerevan has in recent weeks taken steps to break out of the regional isolation it finds itself in On September 6 Turkish President Abdullah Gul paid a landmark visit to Yerevan On September 30 Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian arrived in Tbilisi for his first visit to Georgia since the warDiplomats in the region say Yerevan is pressing Turkey to open up the mutual border which has been closed since 1993 Western officials say there are rumors that in order to secure a breakthrough in relations with Turkey Armenia may consider returning to Azerbaijan five of the seven Azerbaijani provinces it currently occupies around NagornoKarabakhCurrently Georgia provides the only overland access route between Armenia and the outside world and maintaining good relations with Tbilisi remains a must for YerevanThe delicate interdependence between the three countries will be brought into sharp relief this winter Like last winter Georgia will need Azerbaijani gas to survive Aside from Iran Armenia can only turn to Georgia in its quest for gas as it lacks a border with Russia and remains on nontrading terms with both Azerbaijan and TurkeyMeanwhile Russia is actively seeking to reestablish control over the region Moscow is said to be intent on frustrating any rapprochement between Yerevan and Ankara and has blocked Armenian attempts to restore a key railway link to Turkey that is owned by a Russian companyRussia is also putting pressure on Baku Russia has offered to buy all of Azerbaijans gas and oil exports at world prices There are also reports that Russian passports are being handed out in Azerbaijans restive north bordering Daghestan which could serve as a warning for Baku and certainly evokes uneasy parallels with the Russian action in the Georgias breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in August
https://www.rferl.org/a/How_Cohesive_Is_The_Armenian_Leadership/1270701.html,How Cohesive Is The Armenian Leadership ,"September 23, 2008 13:11 GMT",,Levon TerPetrossian addresses a crowd in Yerevan on September 15Two events over the past three weeks  the landmark visit to Yerevan on September 6 by Turkish President Abdullah Gul and the resignation on September 19 under pressure of parliament speaker Tigran Torosian  have again focused attention on possible fissures within Armenias coalition governmentFormer President Levon TerPetrossian pointed to those perceived disagreements in his address at an opposition rally in Yerevan on September 15 But three days later National Security Council Secretary Artur Baghdasarian the chairman of one of the four coalition parties categorically rejected TerPetrossians allegations claiming the Armenian government has never been so strong and united as it is todayGuls acceptance of the invitation extended by his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian was widely greeted both within Armenia and abroad as paving the way for a gradual normalization of relations meaning opening the border between the two countries and establishing formal diplomatic tiesBut the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD which is ambivalent about the clause in the Armenian Constitution adopted in summer 1995 abjuring any territorial claims on presentday Turkey was less enthusiastic Several hundred of its members staged protests during Guls visit and the party subsequently issued a statement advocating cautionSpecifically the statement stressed the need for Turkey and the international community to acknowledge formally as genocide the killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as a first step toward rapprochement warned against any concessions to Turkey that could weaken Armenias sovereignty the viability of its existence or the national and state rights of future generations and argued that Turkey must not be allowed to dictate to Armenia conditions for resolving the Karabakh conflict or seek to deepen divisions within the South CaucasusToo PassiveLeading HHD member Vahan Hovannisian explained the partys position to journalists on September 18 criticizing Armenian diplomacy visavis Turkey as too passive and complaining that Turkey is reaping greater benefits from Sarkisians overture than Armenia is RFERLs Armenian Service reportedAt the same time Hovannisian downplayed the diverging views between the HHD and its coalition partners and effectively gave his partys blessing to the decision by Sarkisians Republican Party of Armenia HHK to oust parliament speaker Torosian Noting that the constitutional amendments adopted in a referendum in November 2005 enhanced the role of the parliament in political life Hovannisian argued that in order to capitalize on its increased powers the legislature needs a decisive and courageous chairmanCommenting one week earlier on the rumors of Torosians impending resignation HHK Deputy Chairman Razmik Zohrabian similarly argued that a strong person should lead the strong it never happens that a ram leads an army of lions Noyan Tapan reported on September 10 Zohrabian did not explain why if it considered him insufficiently bold and decisive the HHK selected Torosian as parliament speaker in the first placeSome observers may take issue with that implicit criticism of Torosian who has sought doggedly since he was named parliament chairman in June 2007 to strengthen the parliament as an institution Rumors first emerged in June that the HHK was seeking to replace Torosian with Hovik Abrahamian who served under President Sarkisians predecessor Robert Kocharian as deputy prime minister and was named in April to head Sarkisians presidential staffThose rumors suggested that the rationale for installing Abrahamian as speaker was to pave the way for Kocharians appointment as prime minister Abrahamian who was elected to parliament just four weeks ago in a constituency previously held by his brother Henrik is widely perceived to have profited from his closeness to Kocharian in order to acquire for pennies several wineries and other enterprises The daily Chorrord ishkhanutiun on September 17 published a list of what it claimed are Abrahamians total assets They also reportedly include all intercity transport routes and two apartment buildings in central YerevanTigran TorosianIntrigues And ConspiraciesHaving warned in June that he did not intend to step down voluntarily Torosian finally capitulated on September 16 He told journalists that for three or four months everything was being done by means of intrigues and conspiracies behind the scene to force me to step down I would advise certain people to take their 30 pieces of silver and continue on their wayCiting irreconcilable differences with the parliament majority on a number of issues concerning the countrys domestic political life Torosian said he had submitted his resignation from the HHK but intended to retain his parliament mandate as an independent deputy He formally resigned as parliament speaker on September 19In an interview with RFERLs Armenian Service Zohrabian denied the existence of any irreconcilable differences between Torosian and the HHK leadership Zohrabian also said Torosian was offered various government or diplomatic posts in exchange for his resignation as speaker including that of minister for the diasporaThe HHK has formally proposed Abrahamian to succeed Torosian as speaker but the parliament has not yet voted on his candidacy Nor according to Hraparak on September 20 has Abrahamian yet attended a parliament session They say he wants to enter the National Assembly as parliament speaker and does not want to take the seat of a rankandfile deputy the paper commentedTorosians replacement was adduced on September 15 by former President TerPetrossian as evidence of growing cracks within the pyramid of power as a result of what TerPetrossian termed the redistribution of administrative resources and influence as well as property and wealth Addressing a rally in Yerevan attended by thousands of his supporters TerPetrossian contrasted Abrahamian unfavorably with Torosian Tigran Torosian is not a child of the criminal world and by appointing Hovik Abrahamian they have finally criminalized the parliament RFERLs Armenian Service quoted him as sayingRumors And OpinionsTerPetrossian also focused on the differences he said exist between Sarkisian and Kocharian He claimed that rumors about Kocharians plans to return active politics by becoming prime minister are fueled by Kocharians close associates and are directed against SarkisianThe opinion is being disseminated that Serzh Sarkisian is unable to restrain the popular opposition movement that he will lose power soon and that the whole underworld will lose everything They say Robert Kocharian is the only salvation for these people who own huge riches TerPetrossian said Sarkisian in turn is aware that he stands to be stripped of real power and reduced to a figurehead if he does name Kocharian prime minister according to TerPetrossianTerPetrossian cited the HHDs opposition to Guls visit to Yerevan as a further sign of weakness and indecision on Sarkisians part arguing that Sarkisians failure to expel the HHD from the governing coalition testifies to his inability to control the current situationWe dont think we can simply demand and he will resign Nobody resigns in that wayWhether the broad opposition movement that TerPetrossian heads could profit from the perceived friction within the countrys leadership remains doubtful however True TerPetrossians close aide Levon Zurabian told journalists on September 11 that tens of thousands of people are flocking to join the umbrella Armenian National Congress HAK inaugurated by TerPetrossian early last month and which has opened local offices in each of Yerevans electoral districts and in Armenias 10 provinces But at a press conference on September 2 TerPetrossian sounded a cautious note making clear that he will not seek to stage the kind of color revolution that toppled the ruling regimes in Georgia and Ukraine He implied that the opposition is preparing for a more prolonged and civilized struggleFor me the main slogan or the essence of our activity is the strengthening of the movement the development of the congress which will automatically lead to regime change and Serzh Sarkisians resignation he said We dont think we can simply demand and he will resign Nobody resigns in that wayTide Of ConfrontationThe biggest challenge TerPetrossian faces is to sustain if not build upon the popular support he mustered during the February presidential ballot in which according to official returns he placed second to Sarkisian with 215 percent of the vote over the next 2 12 years until the parliamentary elections due in 2011Writing on September 19 in Hayots ashkhar political analyst Aleksandr Iskanderian predicted that if the opposition fails to create a powerful tide of confrontation and that does not seem likely then everything will be as it always is in such cases there will be groups of people who criticize the authorities unite in one common network continue to oppose the regime but their potential will not be sufficient to stage a revolution Moreover their numbers will keep dwindling and they will not be able to accomplish any more than they have managed to do so farAnd as former Yerevan Mayor Albert Bazeyan pointed out in an interview published on September 19 in the opposition daily Aravot even if the standoff between Sarkisian and Kocharian precipitates a preterm presidential election there is no guarantee that the ballot will be fairRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by email subscribe to RFERL Caucasus Report

https://www.rferl.org/a/Lousy_Timing_Turkey_Caucasus_Solution/1199495.html,Lousy Timing Could Overshadow Turkeys Logical Caucasus Solution ,"September 12, 2008 11:18 GMT",Within days of the start of fullscale hostilities last month between Georgia and Russia Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan floated the idea of a Caucasus stability pact modeled on a 1999 Balkan agreement ,Within days of the start of fullscale hostilities last month between Georgia and Russia Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan floated the idea of a Caucasus stability pact modeled on a 1999 Balkan agreement But the diverging geopolitical and economic interests of the proposed five members and the ambiguous status of Georgias breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia constitute seemingly insurmountable obstacles to such an allianceAs outlined by Erdogan the proposed Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact would bring together Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia Russia and Turkey His stated intention of discussing the initiative with UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon suggests that he envisaged the UN assuming the role of patron in the same way as the European Union did for the 1999 Balkan Stability Pact which came in the wake of the Kosovo conflict Turkish President Abdullah Gul endorsed Erdogans proposal one day later on August 12 saying the Caucasus pact would be important for stability in the region and could encompass a mechanism for addressing and resolving problems presumably before they escalated into violenceThere are however several fundamental differences between the Balkans in 1999 and the South Caucasus in 2008 In 1999 the countries of Southeastern Europe including the Yugoslav successor states had a shared interest in integration into European and EuroAtlantic structures Furthering such integration was one of the primary objectives of the Balkan Stability Pact together with preventing further conflicts in the region fostering peace democracy respect for human rights and economic prosperity and stimulating regional cooperation In other words membership of the Balkan Stability Pact was intended as a winwin situation for all former adversaries Shared ObjectivesBy contrast the five proposed members of the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact have no shared objective or vision that would serve as an incentive for setting aside their differences On the contrary in some cases such as the deadlock between Armenia and Azerbaijan over NagornoKarabakh their most important policy objectives diverge or even collide to the point that reconciling them is seen as a zerosum gameEven prior to the August war Georgia considered Russia the primary threat to its stability Now having quit the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS and severed diplomatic relations with Russia it would almost certainly make any cooperation whether bilateral or multilateral contingent on Moscow retracting its formal recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states which Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ruled out doing Russia for its part has no obvious interest in promoting any regional cooperation that would strengthen Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia economically Only Turkey would stand to benefit immediately from a mechanism that would among other things safeguard the export pipelines that bring Caspian oil and gas to Turkey via Azerbaijan and Georgia That traffic was temporarily halted at the height of the August hostilities between Georgia and Russia Two further factors cast serious doubts over the viability of the Turkish proposal The first is the Karabakh conflict given that Azerbaijani leaders have for years said that including Armenia in any regional cooperation projects such as the KarsTbilisiBaku railway that is currently under construction is contingent on resolving that conflict on Bakus terms In fact it was the Karabakh conflict that thenAzerbaijani President Heidar Aliyev adduced as the main obstacle to a regional stability pact when thenTurkish President Suleiman Demirel and his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze first floated the idea in January 2000 The second factor is the exclusion of Iran which aspires to the role of a regional player Addressing the Georgian parliament in March 2000 thenArmenian President Robert Kocharian advocated structuring the proposed pact on the formula 332 meaning that Ruusia Turkey and Iran as the countries bordering on the three South Caucasus states should serve as guarantors of the pact and the EU and the United States as its sponsorsThe Brusselsbased Center for European Policy Studies unveiled in June 2000 a detailed consultative document that examined in detail the optimum composition of a Caucasus Stability Pact what issues it should address and how it might function The preface denies that it is modeled on the Balkan Stability Pact but at the same time notes the similarities and differences that then existed between the two regions The document postulated six chapters three focusing on relations among the South Caucasus states including conflict resolution and prevention and establishing a regionalsecurity system and three focusing on broader regional cooperation that would draw in Russia and the Black Sea and Caspian regions It did not rule out the inclusion of Iran in a Caucasus Contact Group that would discuss implementation of that proposed agenda and it took as a given the involvement of such international organizations as the UN the OSCE the Council of Europe the World Bank and International Monetary Fund IMF and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRDWindow Of OpportunityAlthough eminently rational and stuffed with innovative ideas such as the introduction of South Caucasus Community passports the working document was not unequivocally endorsed by any of the proposed beneficiaries although Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba told the coauthors in August 2000 that Abkhazia would like to participate on equal terms with the other eight players Iran for its part rejected the inclusion of the EU and the United States arguing for the formula 33 meaning Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia plus Russia Turkey and Iran With hindsight the window of opportunity for formalizing such a Caucasus Pact began to swing shut in the summer of 2004 when Georgia launched its first abortive effort to bring South Ossetia back under its control by military force That closure could possibly have been reversed but for the confrontational policies and brinkmanship espoused by the Georgian leadership visavis Moscow the unwillingness of both Armenia and Azerbaijan to make the concessions needed for an equitable solution to the Karabakh conflict and the protracted standoff between the United States and IranMeanwhile the geopolitical balance has changed dramatically since Erdogan resurrected the idea of a Caucasus Stability Pact one month ago Russia has formally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and is moving to cement closer military ties with both entities It could therefore insist on their inclusion in any regional forum President Gul has paid a landmark visit to Yerevan thereby paving the way for intensive discussions on the terms for establishing formal diplomatic relations with Armenia In response both to that anticipated rapprochement and to the chaos unleashed by Georgias strategic miscalculation in precipitating a war with Russia Azerbaijan is now tilting away from the West and toward MoscowThis growing mistrust and incipient polarization suggest that at least in the immediate future the sole avenue for cooperation among the countries of the region will be bilateral agreements Armenia and Turkey signed such an agreement on energy supplies during Guls September 6 visit to Yerevan In the longer term Dimitrios Triantophyllou of the International Center for Black Sea Studies was quoted by the Turkish Daily News on August 29 as suggesting the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization  of which the three South Caucasus states Turkey and Russia are all members  could conceivably lay the groundwork open channels of communication and provide the infrastructure within which diplomats from the five countries could address the political differences between them

by Turkish President Abdullah Gul to Armenia is followed by more diplomatic contacts and negotiations it may prove to have been truly a farreaching strategic event for the whole region,If the historic visit by Turkish President Abdullah Gul to Armenia is followed by more diplomatic contacts and negotiations it may prove to have been truly a farreaching strategic event for the whole regionIt will not only have a direct impact on ArmenianAzerbaijani relations and the NagornoKarabakh conflict but it will open up unprecedented doors for Armenia economically The landlocked country will reduce its dependence on Iran and Russia and it can hope to achieve strategic security after centuries of costly domination by despotic Ottoman rulers and later animosity by Turkish nationalist political forcesIs the ground ready for a continuing rapprochement between the two neighbors From the Armenian perspective conditions for a final and lasting peace with Turkey have been gaining momentum since the country became independent in 1991 As long as Armenia was part of the Soviet empire it was the Armenian diaspora that defined the political discourse and embodied the aspirations of the 8 million Armenians scattered from Los Angeles to the far corners of Russia But once Armenia became independent it was only a matter of time before its governments would be seen as the main political and diplomatic representatives of a world nation In this sense there are many similarities between JewsIsrael and ArmeniansArmenia as two nations that have been historically scattered throughout the world and only a minority of which lives in the historic homelandSince 1991 successive Armenian governments very quickly abandoned the diasporas hard line visavis Turkey and sought peace and dialogue with Ankara However the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan put Turkey in the tough position of having to choose between its ethnic kin and its problematic neighbor So far Turkey has chosen the former and has avoided diplomatic relations with Armenia and closed its vital border with its neighborBut this may gradually change now although issues remain as complicated as ever Armenia wants from Turkey a recognition of the genocide that took place during World War I Without it no Armenian government can establish truly normal relations with Turkey just as Israel could have never accepted postWorld War II Germany as a friend without German acceptance of responsibility for the Holocaust However unlike Israel Armenians most probably will not ask for the kind of wideranging compensation that Germany agreed to The great majority of Armenians for example know very well that any territorial claims on Turkey are not only out of the question but even dangerous for the safe existence of their small country Perhaps some mutual agreement to protect the Armenian cultural heritage in the former Armenianinhabited parts of Turkey could serve as a sweetener added to the recognition of the 191518 tragedy It is simply hard to imagine any other concessions from TurkeyNagornoKarabakh PuzzleThe other complication is Armenias dispute with Azerbaijan over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno Karabakh Without a TurkishArmenian rapprochement it hard to see how Armenia and Azerbaijan can solve this issue At the same time without a peace agreement for NagornoKarabakh it is hard to see how Turkey and Armenia can solve their historic differencesGeographically caught between Turkey and Azerbaijan Armenia yearns for strategic security The roots of the Karabakh war lie in the events of 191518 It is the neverending psychological trauma Armenians feel of impending annihilation at the hands of the Turks that led to the fight against Azerbaijan to secure the existence of their enclave If Turkey and the Armenians had solved their differences before the last days of the Soviet empire it is hard to imagine that the issue of Karabakh would have escalated into a bloody fullscale warOf course many at the time believed that the Russians fearing a complete loss of control over their periphery somehow encouraged the conflict based on the dictum of divide and rule Perhaps so but Russias recent actions in Georgia also pose a big question mark as to what Russia will do if Armenia moves ahead to reach a full normalization of relations with Turkey That would really give Russia cause for concern Armenia landlocked and sandwiched between Turkey and Azerbaijan was ready to be an outpost for postcommunist Russia in the region But peace with Turkey would fundamentally change the geopolitical realityIn the coming months and years Russia can still play a lot of cards it has hidden up its sleeve Turkey Armenia and Azerbaijan need all the wisdom fortitude and vision they can get to find a threeway formula that would satisfy all three parties and still either circumvent Russia or include it in the deal After all Armenia can still host Russian military bases and Azerbaijan can give a large enough piece of the oil and gas pie to its former masters in MoscowMardo Soghom is senior media market analyst for RFERL The views expressed in this commentary are the authors own and do not necessarily

https://www.rferl.org/a/Turkey_Preconditions_Relations_With_Armenia/1197132.html,Could Turkey Abandon Preconditions For Relations With Armenia ,"September 08, 2008 09:44 GMT",Two months ago during a summit in Astana on July 7 Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian extended an official invitation to his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to travel to Yerevan so they could watch together as their national soccer teams played a match Since then public opinion in both countries has been divided as to what lay behind the invitation whether Gul would accept it and whether he should,Two months ago during a summit in Astana on July 7 Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian extended an official invitation to his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to travel to Yerevan so they could watch together as their national soccer teams played a match Since then public opinion in both countries has been divided as to what lay behind the invitation whether Gul would accept it and whether he shouldThere are of course many factors hindering the normalization of relations between the two countries Several external players in particular Russia have no interest in the opening of the ArmenianTurkish border as this could lead to Armenia turning toward the West Any positive developments in Armenias relations with Turkey would be painful for Azerbaijan And within Turkey the normalization of relations with Armenia is not viewed as an urgent priorityArmenias Soccer Defeat Opens Door To Breakthrough In Turkey Relations says Barcin Yinanc of the Turkish Daily NewsEven before Sarkisians initiative Turkey was trying to use its strategic partnership with Georgia and Azerbaijan to broaden its influence in the South Caucasus without regard for its lack of formal relations with Armenia For that reason it appeared that Armenia needed a normalization of relations more than Turkey did It was also clear that Turkey required something more substantial than Sarkisians proposals to begin normalizing relations a process that would have to include establishing a joint commission to evaluate historical issues before it would agree to open the borderBreakthrough MomentThe situation changed radically however after Russia launched largescale military operations against Georgia on August 8 advancing far beyond the South Ossetian conflict zone In the wake of Guls visit to Yerevan it is obvious that it was the crisis in Georgia which demonstrated the vulnerability of the countries in the region that was the deciding factor in this breakthrough in bilateral relations For that reason all the problems in ArmenianTurkish relations including the dispute over the recognition of the 1915 genocide of Armenians and the deadlocked conflict over NagornoKarabakh have now been relegated to the back burnerTurkey was so concerned by the Russian military intervention in Georgia and by the advance of Russian forces into the southern and western regions of the country that in midAugust it dispatched Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Moscow to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev We can assume that the leaders discussed two issues that are crucial for Turkey The first was the possibility that Moscow would recognize the independence of NagornoKarabakh Ankara understood very well that Russia would not be content with simply establishing military control over South Ossetia but would seek to substantiate that military victory by legal measures such as recognizing South Ossetia as an independent state Defeat in Yerevan could lead to breakthroughThe second issue was Russias stance toward the continued functioning of the oil and gas pipelines and also the highways that link Azerbaijan and Turkey via Georgia That issue arose because Russia had engaged in maneuvers in western Georgia to secure control of the ports of Poti and Batumi and the strategic GoriPoti highway and railwayWithout going into detail we can say that the war led to the disruption of economic ties across the entire South Caucasus region The ports of Poti and Batumi were bombed some stretches of the TbilisiBatumi railroad were rendered unusable and widespread damage was inflicted on Georgias economic and energy infrastructureArmenia suffered serious economic damage because the territory of Georgia is the lifeline that connects it by trade and economic routes to Russia and Europe According to Armenian government statistics during the military phase of the Georgian conflict Armenias trade turnover fell by a factor of eightBut Azerbaijan and Turkey also experienced difficulties Exports via the BakuTbilisiCeyhan oil pipeline and the BakuTbilisiErzerum gas pipeline were temporarily halted because of the fighting Almost all energy and transport projects linking Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey were suspended and today the Georgian economy is on the verge of collapse In other words it turns out that limiting its regional cooperation with Georgia and Azerbaijan could not shield Turkey from serious repercussions A Broken LinkIt used to be difficult to envisage a situation in the South Caucasus in which Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey did not constitute a selfsufficient system But as soon as the Georgian link in the chain gave way the entire system began to break down and it became clear that in this emergency situation Armenia could be indispensable In fact the August events in Georgia have demonstrated just how important it is to have alternative mechanisms for regional cooperationFor example if Armenia had not been excluded from the oil and gas pipelines built in the South Caucasus  if even one or two of those pipelines had transited Armenian territory  then the countries of the region could have exported oil and gas via Armenia even amid the Georgian crisis Or it would have been possible to compensate at least partially for the disruption in Georgian rail traffic by rerouting trains via the railroad from Kars in eastern Turkey to Giumri in Armenia and then to TbilisiA break in the transport chainIt is of paramount importance that the Turkish leadership which was the first to realize just how serious the situation was has come to understand all these problems We can therefore expect serious and concrete new initiatives from them in the near future  first and foremost addressing the opening of the ArmenianTurkish border and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations In that context it is worth pointing out that Abdullah Guls visit to Yerevan was primarily political and the soccer match between the Armenian and Turkish teams was of secondary significance even though it served as a perfect pretext for the two leaders to meetIts a shame that the ArmenianTurkish border was not opened even temporarily to allow Turkish soccer fans to travel to the game But just the fact that a Turkish president has visited Armenia constitutes a serious breakthrough in ArmenianTurkish relations  not just from a political perspective but also from a psychological oneEven a few days ago it would have been difficult to imagine the president of a country hostile to Armenia traveling to Yerevan There is no doubt that this visit will help to surmount the huge psychological barrier of mutual distrust and tension that exists between the Armenian and Turkish peoples The visit will also contribute to the creation of a new atmosphere of good neighborly relationsIt is likely that the ArmenianTurkish border will be opened in the wake of Guls visit This would serve as a major stimulus for more active trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and for including Armenia in regional transport and energy projects In the long term it would contribute to Armenias reorientation toward the West and integration into the European Union and NATOGuls visit will also almost certainly lead to a reexamination of Turkeys relations with Armenia It is possible that Turkey will very soon abandon its preconditions for normalizing relations Yerevan has also clearly affirmed its readiness to establish diplomatic ties without preconditions The situation that has arisen in the South Caucasus requires decisive actions from the leaders of

09:40 GMT",Sometimes small coincidences lead to big events said the Turkish President Abdullah Gul to the small group of journalists that accompanied him on his historic visit to Yerevan,Sometimes small coincidences lead to big events said the Turkish President Abdullah Gul to the small group of journalists that accompanied him on his historic visit to YerevanWhen the news came last November that the Turkish and Armenian national soccer teams were drawn in the same group it is hard to know whether Gul foresaw that this small trick of fate would make him the first Turkish president in history to visit Armenia But what we know for sure from his close advisers is that when he received the news that Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian invited him to Yerevan to watch the match together his immediate reaction was positiveTurning down the invitation would have given a negative image of Turkey to the world It would have created the impression that Turkey is closed to dialogue against initiatives on human issues a close adviser to Gul says But in the costbenefit analysis it is not the cost of saying no but rather the benefit of saying yes that determined the final decision Gul embarked on this historic visit with the clear intention and hope that it would herald a new phase in the bitter relations between two traditional foesCould Turkey Abandon Preconditions For Relations With Armenia asks Stepan Grigoryan of the Analytical Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in YerevanThe visit which was criticized by opposition parties signals a significant shift in Turkeys policy toward Armenia The question of whether ethnic Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I were victims of genocide and the conflict over the Azerbaijani enclave of NagornoKarabakh poisoned relations from the outset when Armenia declared its independence in 1991 Turkey refused to establish diplomatic ties with Armenia due to its international campaign for the killings to be classified as genocide and closed its border after Armenia occupied parts of neighboring Azerbaijan Turkeys close ally With the lack of progress on both issues Turkey stepped up its isolation policy by excluding Armenia from regional projects such as the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline that transports Azerbaijani oil to Turkey via Georgia Although Armenia most probably suffered from this exclusion policy it neither withdrew its claims of genocide nor endorsed a more flexible stance on the issue of NagornoKarabakh prompting some Turkish decision makers to question the merits of the policy visavis Armenia and start looking for a way outBut former Armenian President Robert Kocharians rejection of successive Turkish overtures such as establishing a commission of historians from both countries to reach consensus on the 1915 killings meant those who favored a positive engagement with Armenia could not gain the upper hand among policymakers The debate continues today Advocates of the isolation policy point to the results of the February 2008 Armenian presidential election Former President Levon TerPetrossian who is known to be more conciliatory on both Turkey and Azerbaijan made a surprise political comeback and Sarkisians victory against him was highly contestedThe Turkish government was expecting Sarkisian to follow the same line as his predecessor But it was pleasantly surprised to see a leader more willing to break the deadlock in relations Sarkisians legitimacy was highly shaky He read the message coming from the street and endorsed a more conciliatory line with Turkey says a Turkish diplomat Even before Sarkisians invitation the two countries diplomats started to hold secret negotiations with the aim of normalizing relations Russia Changes The EquationTo what degree Turkeys policy of isolating Armenia has played a role in the current rapprochement is open to debate but what it did for sure was to push Armenia into the arms of Russia Surrounded by two hostile states it was only natural for Armenia to remain close to RussiaThe recent tension between Georgia and Russia changed the balance of forces in the Caucasus and has convinced many that it is time for Ankara and Yerevan to set aside their differences We dont want a polarization between Russia and Armenia on one side and Turkey Azerbaijan and Georgia on the other side says an adviser to the government The Turkish government is quite nervous of the fact that Russia has increased its influence in the region and a strategy to contain Moscow requires the resolution of the conflicts among Caucasian statesFurthermore the crisis has revealed yet again the need for alternative energyexport routes As the route through Georgia will remain vulnerable for some time Armenia could be an attractive alternativeThe recent war between Russia and Georgia highlighted the danger that the frozen conflicts in the region could again turn violent raising the risk of instability but at the same time created an opportunity for new diplomatic efforts to resolve those conflicts observes Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan The Turkish governments proposal for a new mechanism for resolving those conflicts the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform would encompass Turkey Russia Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia But the proposal would have lacked credibility in the absence of a real dialogue between Turkey and Armenia and hence provided another reason for Gul to go to YerevanThe Turkish president clearly took a risk He left Turkey under fierce criticism from the opposition and risked humiliation by demonstrators in Yerevan But the Armenian government kept its word and the visit which lasted only a few hours ended without incidentThe statements by both presidents suggest a genuine eagerness on both sides to start a new phase in diplomatic relations No one is expecting a change in relations overnight There will be lengthy and complicated discussions over the terms for the normalization of ties But the difference this time is that Turkey is about to embark on a new policy of positive engagement with Armenia which in turn must reciprocate with a more conciliatory line As Gul said following his talks in Yerevan the visit has broken down a psychological barrier He might also be right when he said that relations between the two countries will never be the sameThe

questions over whether the rail route would carry football Turkish fans to the Armenian capital in the days ahead of that match highlighted the dizzying scale of questions that linger between Yerevan and AnkaraThere were no official assurances that the ArmenianTurkish border would be opened or even that the rail link would be completed in time for the match In the end the Turkish side would be rooted on by the delegation led by President Abdullah Gul Turkish journalists and fans from the Armenian side of the border Turkey shut down the frontier in a show of support for Baku following the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over NagornoKarabakh The borders reopening was made conditional on a resolution of the dispute one of the worlds most stubborn frozen conflicts and on an end to Armenias efforts to seek international recognition of the mass killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey as genocideBut while little progress on the issue has been made since then the World Cup

carried outWork on the exterior of the Akhurian II Station located between Akhurik and the border was still being conducted on September 4 when there was still talk of a possible trainload of Turkish

was never reopened  and the road like the rail line fell into disrepairGod WillingA local villager said that when there was a word about the opening of the railway a few people came on SUVs and inspected the road then drove away God willing it will be opened said Mayor Ghukasian adding that such an event would be good not only for his city and the Armenian people but also for Turkey and its

World War IWider GoalsAnalysts say Yerevans hope is that a thaw would lead to a permanent reopening of the TurkishArmenian border which has been closed for 15 years Ankaras interest in a detente is seen as part of a larger Turkish strategy of stabilizing relations with its bordering states including Greece Syria Iraq and now ArmeniaMy presidents visit to Yerevanis going to be an important step to open doors for dialogue with Armenia Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told ReutersThe overture came quickly on the heels of Russias crossborder military operations to back separatists in Georgia and Moscows subsequent recognition of their independence a situation that Babacan has described as alarmingBabacan said the war between Russia and Georgia dislodged a series of frozen conflicts in the Caucasus raising risks of further instability but also creating opportunities for new diplomatic efforts to resolve themThe current circumstances we believe are conducive for such a bold step as the bilateral visit Babacan said in an interview late on September 5 in Avignon France where he was attending a meeting of EU foreign ministers Babacan said the fighting in neighboring Georgia showed we need to come up with a fresh approach to resolution of conflict in the CaucasusThe minister rejected Turkish opposition criticism of the rapprochement with Armenia saying it was time for more open

60000 ethnic Armenians Caught between the demands of the Armenian diaspora for Turkey to admit genocide 90 years ago and Turkeys denials most prefer not to talk about the events  Modern Armenia is a small landlocked country on Turkeys eastern border The ancient kingdom of Armenia at its peak stretched from the Mediterranean to the Caspian seas and included much of the territory of modern Turkey  The Muslim Turkish Seljuk and then Ottoman empires ruled Armenian regions from the 11th century until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire during World War I The territory that is now modern Armenia was seized from Persia by Russia in the 19th century was briefly independent following World War I but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920 After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 ethnic Armenians in Turkey became an officially recognized minority like Jews and Greeks and were allowed to run their own schools  The border between Turkey and Armenia has been closed for 14 years because of a dispute between Turkeys ally Azerbaijan and Armenia over the territory of NagornoKarabakh During World War I thousands of Armenians were marched from the Anatolian borders toward Syria and Mesopotamia now Iraq and Armenians say some 15 million died either in massacres or from hunger and thirst in the desert Video Hopes For An Open BorderRFERLs Armenian Service asked residents of the

considerable diplomatic resources to broker peace between Russia and Georgia since their conflict broke out last month over Georgias breakaway republics South Ossetia and Abkhazia,Western governments have deployed considerable diplomatic resources to broker peace between Russia and Georgia since their conflict broke out last month over Georgias breakaway republics South Ossetia and AbkhaziaBut efforts to pacify the entire South Caucasus with its complex history and critical role as a trade and energy conduit have also come from more unexpected quarters  namely Turkey At the peak of the RussiaGeorgia conflict on August 13 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan floated plans to create a socalled Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact that would include the three South Caucasus countries plus two regional heavyweights Turkey and Russia The idea in fact is not new Former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel suggested creating a panSouth Caucasus grouping in the late 1990sBut the armed conflict in Georgia brought the project back to the foreWeve been looking for ways to create a more friendly atmosphere in the region since the 1990s says Oktay Aksoy a researcher with Ankaras Foreign Policy Institute But the latest developments prompted Turkey to think that proposing a kind of platform in which all countries related to the region could participate may give them a chance to smooth out their differences Russia eager to keep the West and NATO at arms length in the South Caucasus has thrown its weight behind the regional pactSpeaking during his visit to Turkey this week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said such a grouping would help participating states mend fences without other countries imposing their own prescriptionsThe three other wouldbe members  Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan  have met the project with more caution Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili for one said her country would not consider joining the group until all Russian forces remaining from the August fighting pull out of GeorgiaThe proposal also got a cold reception in the United States a close ally of Turkey where officials complained they had not been informed in advance and criticized the initiative for failing to include Western nationsHigh StakesTurkey nonetheless appears determined to go ahead with the project which it has already discussed in separate talks with Russian Georgian and Azerbaijani officialsAnkara has much to gain from the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation PactSuch an alliance would boost its diplomatic clout in an increasingly strategic part of the world  giving it a valuable opportunity to stir its longdormant bid to join the European UnionReducing tensions in the South Caucasus would by extension protect Turkeys vast trade and energy interests in the regionThe Caucasus is an important neighborhood for Turkey notes Aksoy Its stability is necessary not only because it neighbors Turkey but also because it is a passageway between Turkey and Central Asia Anything upsetting stability there is a concern for Turkey It is also a route through which Turkey imports its oil and gas and it seeks to be a transit route for these resources to EuropeTurkey is heavily dependent on Russian energy  63 percent of the natural gas and 29 percent of the oil that it consumes hail from RussiaAnkara also meets much of its growing energy needs with Azerbaijani oil coming through the BakuTbilisiCeyhan BTC pipeline  currently the only transnational pipeline that transports Caspian oil without crossing Russian territoryThe war in Georgia and the standoff it has sparked between Russia and the West has set off alarm bells in Ankara Any military conflict between Western and Russian forces vying for influence in the region would put Turkey in the spotlight as the neighborhoods only NATO country  a prospect that would wreck its relations with Russia Turkeys leading trade partner A clash between NATO ie the West and Russia is taking shape in the region Azerbaijani political analyst Rakhim Musabekov tells RFERL In this situation Turkey is on the front line It will have to be a forefront for the West in its battle against Russia It will bear the brunt of this and of a possible frontal conflict with all the losses and the risks it would involve Turkey is trying to find ways to avoid these scenariosUphill BattleTurkeys Caucasus initiative however faces huge diplomatic hurdles before it can get off the ground Relations between Moscow and Tbilisi are at a historical low after their August war Armenia and Azerbaijan remain locked in a bitter dispute over NagornoKarabakh an Armenianmajority rebel territory located within Azerbaijan While Moscow helped the Armenian side in the war that broke out in the enclave in the early 1990s Turkey has traditionally supported Azerbaijan with which it shares strong ethnic and religious tiesThe BTC pipeline has also angered Russia which is waging an aggressive campaign to gain a grip on Azerbaijans vast energy resourcesTurkey itself has no diplomatic relations with Armenia due to the NagornoKarabakh standoff and Yerevans demands that Turkey recognize as genocide the mass slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 Turkey strongly denies the genocide accusations and insists both Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks died in the fightingLast but not least Ankara is embroiled in a nasty trade dispute with Moscow after allowing two US ships to transit the Bosphorus Strait to provide aid to Georgia following the hostilities with Russia With so many challenges before it many believe Turkeys plans to create a South Caucasus alliance is doomed to failureTurkeys ambition is understandable But I think its chances of implementing this idea are extremely small mainly because it will be impossible in the foreseeable future to reconcile the interests of Georgia and Russia says Musabekov I have equally little hope that Turkey will normalize its relations with Armenia to such an extent that it is able to influence Yerevan and persuade it to adopt a compromise that is acceptable for AzerbaijanAnkara would certainly have to tread an even finer line between Russia and the WestTurkeys minority populations from throughout the region also limit its room for diplomatic maneuverWhen looking at the situation in Georgia Abkhazia South Ossetia Chechnya and so forth one has to bear in mind that to some extent these are internal problems for Turkey because there are immigrants from all these areas of the Caucasus living in Turkey and acting as lobbies says David Barchard a history professor at Ankaras Bilkent University Theyre not very visible lobbies  I dont think youd read about them in the Turkish papers  but they are there both in the parliament and the cabinet So Turkey will always have to tread something of a delicate line in order to avoid offending these different and in some cases conflicting minorities Not All So BleakBut theres also cause for optimism about the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation PactTurkish President Abdullah Gul is breaking down a historic barrier by accepting Armenias invitation to attend a football match in Yerevan this weekend a major diplomatic step that could signal a thaw between the two countriesA statement on the Turkish presidents official website said the September 6 match  in which Armenia and Turkey will vie for qualification for the 2010 World Cup  will be instrumental in removing the barriers blocking rapprochement between the two statesLandlocked Armenia too is interested in normalizing relations with Ankara The war in Georgia has disrupted Armenias oil and grain deliveries the bulk of which travel by rail from Georgias Black Sea ports Reopening its sealed border with Turkey would enable Armenia to diversify its import routesSuch rapprochement is likely to find strong support in Russia which has heavily invested in Armenia and is eager to use the country as a springboard to expand its markets throughout the regionBarchard believes the pact has the potential to grow into a constructive regional groupingThere have been some formulas which have been quite successful One is the Black Sea Economic Cooperation pact in which Russia plays a full part Barchard says Its not been a very lively organization it was regarded by some people  I suspect by the United States  as fairly moribund but it has continued to function So I think there must be some prospect that something of this sort could happen with the Turkish initiative It might actually develop into some kind of watch group specifically on the CaucasusShould it fail to ease the regions simmering tensions however the proposed grouping could end up being little more than a talk shop  or what Barchard describes as a grand media circus

immediate aftermath of the Russian military intervention in Georgia last month most diplomats around the world focused on what might be done to resolve or at least minimize the international fallout Most commentators for their part focused on the ways in which this one event might herald a new Cold War,In the immediate aftermath of the Russian military intervention in Georgia last month most diplomats around the world focused on what might be done to resolve or at least minimize the international fallout Most commentators for their part focused on the ways in which this one event might herald a new Cold WarBut already those two groups are paying less attention both to the former given that there does not seem to be any obvious solution and to the latter insofar as whatever happens will not be comparable to the military and ideological confrontation between East and West after World War IIInstead they are considering the myriad ways in which the Georgian events are having an impact on an increasingly large number of more general issues around the worldOf those issues the following are among the most importantAssumptions ShatteredFirst the Georgian crisis has shattered many of the assumptions in both East and West about how oil and gas from the Caspian Basin can best be transported to international markets and as a result about the relations both between producing and transit countries and between those two categories and the rest of the world  Both Caspian Basin oil and gas producers and Western powers have wanted oil and gas export pipelines from that region to bypass Russia but at the same time ruled out Iran as an alternative Given the continued standoff between Azerbaijan and Armenia over NagornoKarabakh that left only one route available Georgia and Russian actions there have called into question the security of those pipelinesAs a result some Caspian Basin states are now considering exporting their hydrocarbons via Russia even if that gives Moscow leverage over them while some Western countries that want to punish Russia are discussing allowing exports via Iran and still others are pushing to resolve the Karabakh crisis in order to allow the export of oil and gas via Armenia As of now neither the countries of the region nor any of the major outside powers have reached any final decision but the mere discussion of these possibilities changes not only the geoeconomics of the region but the geopolitics of the world Such discussion creates the real possibility that old allies may find themselves at odds while old enemies may start cooperating with each other possibilities that none of them could have imagined prior to the Georgian crisisQuestions Of National DefenseSecond Russian intervention has unexpectedly returned questions of national defense to the center of discussions about national security leading some countries to reassess not only their relationships with neighboring countries but also their military budgets and their preferred alliances Even after the end of the Cold War no country assumed that military power was irrelevant but few expected that such power would ever be employed against them Their military establishments were about national pride or about playing a role in peacekeeping operations rather than about defending their national existence Russias actions in Georgia have demolished that selfconfident assumption and now countries are having to decide whether they must reach an accomodation with neighboring states that might be prepared to use force form alliances that will actually protect them from such armed aggression or build up their own military establishments either to ensure that they will be able to preserve their independence or to serve as a trip wire until the international community can respond These issues were not on the table a month ago they now are in many countries far from Georgia Nontraditional ToolsThird the response of the international community to the RussianGeorgian clash has highlighted the continuing and perhaps even growing importance of what might be called nontraditional tools for putting pressure on other countries If Russias actions in Georgia called attention to the continuing importance of military factors the Wests response has highlighted the growing importance of other factors including but not limited to capital flows visa arrangements and diplomatic activities Russia has watched its stock market collapse the ruble decline in value and capital flow outward at unprecedented rates It has forfeited the chance for its citizens to secure visafree travel to European Union countries in the near future and faces more restrictions elsewhere And it has experienced a loss of face as a result of the failure of all but outcast states Belarus and Venezuela to follow its lead in recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia of the Wests decision to slow its admission to the World Trade Organization and of the effective eclipse of the NATORussia Council and the G8 which is rapidly reverting to the G7These things are definitely hurting Russia and will affect its behavior over time Yet because they are not capable of forcing the Russian leadership to back down immediately many in the West and some in Moscow dismiss their importance But in conflicts of interest that involve major powers such responses are both safer and more important And over time they are likely to prove more effective as wellTerritorial IntegrityFourth the events in Georgia have reopened questions about the proper balance between the right of nations to selfdetermination and the right of states to have their territorial integrity respected by other members of the international community  The international community in fact consists first and foremost of states that have a vested interest in the defense of their territorial integrity and that look with suspicion at the widely proclaimed right of nations to selfdetermination to an extent that may call the former principle into question Not surprisingly most of the time the world comes down on the side of the former and against the latter but by its actions in Georgia Moscow has opened the door to more demands based on the latter It may well come to regret having done so when its own increasingly restive national minorities formulate such demandsFifth the events of the last month in Georgia have shattered the selfconfident assumptions both in the West where many policymakers believed that clashes between the major powers were a thing of the past and in the Russian Federation where many senior officials thought they could act with impunity because the West could neither unite nor respond to Moscows actions in the socalled Near Abroad Twenty years ago many in the West were prepared to accept the notion that the world had reached the end of history with its corollary assumption that the future would be both nonviolent and dull The intervening years have cast doubt on that for many but Russias actions in Georgia have destroyed that view in the minds of almost allUnlike a generation ago few now expect the future to be peaceful while many more expect that the 21st century may turn out to be as violent in its way as was the 20th That disillusion may in fact prove to be the most serious and longlasting consequence of

Lavrov is scheduled to arrive in Ankara on September 1 where bilateral discussions will focus on the presence in the Black Sea of US warships transporting humanitarian aid to Georgia The deputy chief of the Russian armed forces General Staff Anatoly Nogovitsyn said last week that according to a 1936 agreement ships belonging to nonlittoral countries may not remain in the Black Sea for longer than 21 days Turkish media quoted Nogovitsyn as warning that Russia will wait until that deadline expires after which it will hold Turkey responsible for the situation Lavrov will also be talking to the Turks about Ankaras proposed Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact that would encompass Turkey Russia Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan Details of this platform have not been disclosed but Turkish media quoted government officials as saying that it aims at strengthening peace stability mutual respect and trade in the region Georgia severed diplomatic relations with Russia on August 29 in the wake of the August 8 incursion of Russian forces into Georgia and the formal recognition by Russia on August 26 of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states Armenian forces still occupy several districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to the breakaway NagornoKarabakh Republic Turkey currently has no diplomatic relations with Armenia Its preconditions for establishing such ties are a settlement of the Karabakh conflict the definitive recognition by the Armenian government of the current border between the two countries and an end to lobbying by Armenia for recognition that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire constituted genocide Those fundamental differences militate against a formal pactLiving With The BearTurkey heavily depends on Russian gas and trade Although it was not targeted during the recent hostilities the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline that transports Caspian oil to Turkey and Europe is vulnerable to attack especially in the event that Moscow succeeds in replacing Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili with a leader willing to accommodate Russian interestsBulent Aliriza of the Washingtonbased think tank CSIS tells RFERL that Turkey sandwiched between Russia and the West has no illusions about the immediate success of the Caucasus Pact The Turkish objective is rather to facilitate talks between the five countries that would reduce tensions and ultimately strengthen stability and support regional relations and trade Concerned by the increasing Russian influence in the Caucasus and the Black Sea Turkey is desperately looking for calmer waters Much like Germany it cannot afford to take sides with either Georgia or Russia because although Turks traditionally sympathize with Georgia it needs Russia On the other hand despite its strained relations with Armenia Turkey wants to preach stability although on its own conditions Thus Turkish President Abdullah Gul has not accepted an invitation from his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian to attend a TurkishArmenian soccer match in Yerevan on September 6 Such soccer diplomacy appears unlikely even though it would be a nice cosmetic moveRussia and Armenia look favorably on the Turkish proposal And why shouldnt they Unconditional normalization of relations would legitimize the status quo By contrast Azerbaijan and Georgia have not committed themselves and have little reason to do so as talking business as if no territorial disputes existed would cement their lossesA Turkish proverb says Dont name a still unborn baby Asked if the proposed Caucasus Stability Pact is such a stillborn infant Aliriza said that would be going too far Its about talks defusing tension and opening the door to more stability in the region In view of the conflicts between the five countries it would be premature in the case of the Caucasus Stability Pact even to presume a pregnancy let alone a stillbirth Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin appealed to the European Union on August 29 to act independently rather than follow the foreignpolicy interests of the United States That is precisely what Lavrov hopes to achieve during his visit to Turkey that even if it does not express support for the Russian intervention in Georgia Ankara should remain neutral and let Moscow pursue its agenda in the Near Abroad If the EU is split on this issue it can be no surprise that Turkey dependant on Russian gas and desperate for regional stability and trade is trying not to provoke the neighboring bear that has woken hungry from hibernation Abbas

https://www.rferl.org/a/Caucasus_Diary/1194956.html,Caucasus Diary ,"August 29, 2008 16:23 GMT",,Downtown Yerevan Yerevan ArmeniaArriving in Yerevan is a little like arriving in Las Vegas The terrain yellow desert and scrubs is similar to Nevada and the road from the airport is banked by neonlit casinos There is even a smaller version of the Las Vegas cowboy sign whose swinging arm directs gamblers to a particular casino Like Las Vegas Armenias capital city is a tourist resort During the Soviet period which ended in September 1991 it was popular with Russian tourists But since vacation options for Russians were strictly limited the locals had little incentive to upgrade hotels and other tourist facilities The town was a pleasant historic backwater Very historic as it happens One of its main potential selling points was that Armenia was supposedly the first nation to convert formally to Christianity in the 4th century But that was hardly emphasized under Moscows rule In fact wherever you see an attractive public building such as an opera house  and Yerevan has quite a number of them  it is almost certainly erected on the ruins of an Armenian Orthodox church Today Yerevan is popular with Russian investors and developers Russian investors own almost the countrys entire infrastructure In Yerevan a massive building boom is in progress Vast cranes dominate the skyline One resident counted 75 from her office terrace Accordingly the hotels restaurants and bars are all getting a sophisticated facelift There is still an aroma of the Third World in the dusty side streets But Yerevan will soon become a real capital city and a universally popular tourist destination  or rather it would do so if it were not located in the southern Caucasus next door to a fullscale international crisis in GeorgiaOn the way to lunch I receive a call on my mobile phone from a friend in Oxford I postpone the conversation explaining that I am in a taxi in the middle of Yerevan I get a fine example of British oneupmanship in reply Oh did the taxi take a wrong turning But you can see his point the southern Caucasus is the Rubiks Cube of international disputes Every time you try to solve one crisis you make another worse Next door to Armenia is oilrich and Muslim Azerbaijan Both countries claim the territory of NagornoKarabakh which the Soviets assigned to Azerbaijan even though its population was mainly ethnic Armenian They went to war over it in the late 1980s even though both were constituentstates of the USSR at the time In 1994 an eventual ceasefire left the Armenians in possession of both NagornoKarabakh and some part of Azerbaijan proper Refugees exist on both sides Nothing is settled The dispute is one of those frozen conflicts that Russia has cleverly exploited to maintain indirect control of its near abroad Armenia and Azerbaijan are each anxious to keep Russia on its side Neither likes Russian dominance of the neighborhood both accept it as a fact of life But other powerful neighbors also intervene Sympathetic to Azerbaijan on ethnoreligious grounds Turkey has imposed a blockade on Armenian trade going through its territory That is a real restraint on Armenias otherwise very healthy economy growing in recent years at an average of 13 percent thanks to privatization and other reforms Still the Turkish blockade means that a very high proportion of Armenias trade has to be conveyed by railway through Georgia to the port of Poti on the Black Sea That railway is now vulnerable to Russian disruption aimed at Georgia  and Poti is still in Russian military hands A Graham Greene sort of place is how a friend described Yerevans mixture of exoticism and dustiness to me in advance I should have thought it rather an Eric Ambler sort of place after the British espionage thriller writer The Mask of Dimitrios Journey into Fear Topkapi who specialized in innocents abroad getting drawn into dangerous mysteries against seedily exotic backdropsMaybe I had these gloomy thoughts however because on the day before I left Prague a different kind of Eric Ambler kind of place one of my colleagues in Radio Libertys office in Armenia was beaten up He was the 16th journalist to be beaten up in Armenia in the last six months or so No one has yet been arrested for these attacks Armenias president made a very strong statement ordering the police to investigate the attack zealously Since this was a big story in Yerevan I was interviewed by two woman journalists one of whom had herself been roughed up from opposition newspapers As executive editor of Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty I welcomed the presidents remarks as a first step towards providing the media with proper protection from political violence and official unconcern But I couldnt help noticing that my interviewers exchanged skeptical glances Suspicion between the media and the government is only one example of a wider problem Armenia is an exceptionally divided society and has been since March 1 when police shot demonstrators protesting against abuses in an election in which the ruling partys candidate was elected with an implausible 52 percent majority Tanks on the streets of Yerevan in March Ten people died including one policeman and one soldier from the Interior Ministry more than 100 demonstrators and opposition figures were arrested and a state of emergency was imposed for a time This was a shock to an Armenian public that had been assuming that gradual if erratic progress towards real democracy was unstoppableA coalition of opposition parties has since been holding more or less permanent demonstrations in Yerevan  demonstrations that are declared illegal but allowed to proceed At the same time the government has been proceeding too  with trials of demonstrators US and European officials and human rights NGOs appeal solemnly for dialogue between government and opposition But its not clear what they would talk aboutPresident Serzh Sarkisian has made some modest conciliatory gestures of talking with the opposition and the leading opposition figure Levon TerPetrossian has responded by placing most of the blame for the brutal crackdown on the previous president But in a struggle for power  which is whats going on  there has to be more than thatA Western diplomat suggests over lunch that the president is waiting for a substantial number of demonstrators to be convicted by the courts of using violence He could then issue an amnesty all round while pointing out that the opposition had been shown to be quite as blameworthy as the government though he might not phrase it exactly that way Reconciliation would then proceedThat may happen Sarkisian seems to want something like it But the real underlying question is will the tragedy of March 1 push Armenians on both sides of the divide to accept truly fair elections and just as important fair campaigns leading up to them Americans and Europeans are here in droves urging such an outcome and offering the inducement of greater economic integration with the West as a quid pro quo But as my diplomat friend points out the Russians are also here in force smoothly asking Why bother with all that pious nonsense Come over to the dark side Good money and no questions asked Given that Russian influence on Armenia is so strong anyway it is significant that this appeal is not more effective Both government and opposition keep talking to their Western interlocutors if not to each other It is possible that simple admiration for democracy is the reason One would like to think so But it is also possible that Armenians a famously shrewd and even crafty people have some doubts that their powerful neighbor will ultimately prove to be the winning side even locallyWhen I go down to the Hotel Yerevans business center to write this diary my email directs me to a blogging entry by the Hollywood writerdirector Rob Long who happens to be an old friend and colleague from the American magazine National Review Rob was writing his blog from down the road in Azerbaijan where he was attending a conference Sometimes life is like an Eric Ambler novel he writes going on to wonder if a recent attack on the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline supposedly carried out by the terrorist PKK may instead have been the work of well  what Hollywood and Eric Ambler used to describe as a certain power to the east Or since were in the Caucasus to the northWhat if a large powerful state  a state with huge resources a history of meddling fomenting instability supporting terrorism  that has been saddled with a sluggish backward economic system suddenly casts off that system and becomes instead a sort of enormous powerful ruthless gangsterstate What would it be capable of How would we stop itNot bad questions  questions also being asked by Armenians and Azerbaijanis as well as by Georgians Some representatives of the unnameable power to the north were probably attending the same conference as Rob in light disguise If life can sometimes be like an Eric Ambler novel what would one of Amblers cynical spymasters make of these new industrial spies Indeed what would they make of Rob himself Maybe they would mix up the twoI ran into one of our notquiteexSoviet friends in the bar You have to wonder what Moscow Circus is thinking about these days They go to immense trouble to get the clothes accent and haircut exactly right  and then they saddle the poor fellow with a ridiculous cover story A Hollywood director who talks my ear off about fly fishing Really Why not a Highland ghillie who dreams of being a tapdancer I bought him a stiff vodka ignoring his pathetic requests for Scotch just to show I was onto himStill an important diplomatic breakthrough occurred while I was in Yerevan The TurkishArmenian youth soccer match ended in a 21 victory for the Armenians Significantly both sides were cheered by the crowd after a goodnatured game in the presence of Turkish diplomats This was considered a good omen for the adult TurkishArmenian game in September to which President Sarkisian hasPresident Serzh Sarkisian  invited his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul Guls acceptance is still uncertain but the ArmenianTurkish railway is being reopened until after the match to allow Turkish fans to attend more easily and the smart money is betting that the soccer summit will now take place If so that would be merely the start of a long process of negotiations on a range of issues from the Turkish massacres of Armenians in World War I  were they stateordered genocide or something less heinous  to the lifting of Turkeys embargo on Armenian trade But it would be a start that few people expected a month ago Observers then assumed that Azerbaijan had enough clout with Ankara to head off any such talks What changed matters is the Russian attack on Georgia A shiver of instability has run through the Caucasus and all the major players except Russia are anxious to restore mutual security as best they can All three countries in the southern Caucasus are nervous about the threat to the oil and gas pipelines posed by ethnic and regional instability All of them especially Georgia at present would like to see Russian dominance diluted by other powers All now seem more prepared to reduce the level of their local conflicts NagornoKarabakh has been consigned to the icebox for the moment Talks between Ankara and Yerevan are on the agenda But can anything more substantial and positive be doneVartan Oskanian was Armenian foreign minister for 10 years until this April He now heads a think tank the Civilitas Foundation in Yerevan He is one of the few Armenian politicians who exerts moral authority over government and opposition at home and enjoys high repute abroadIn his office overlooking the city he sketches out Caucasian realities The Russians are dominant but the Caucasus wants to be part of modern Europe Their people want prosperity and freedom For that however the Caucasian neighbors need a level of security which NATO cannot provide in the teeth of Russian opposition So faster integration into the European Union is probably part of the answer That would be acceptable to the Russians since being heavily invested in Armenia they too would gain from closer EU ties All this would be progress but not quite enough of it There has to be a security component in any stable longterm solution If NATO is not the answer what is Turkey has recently woken up from almost a century of sleep on foreign policy It is now almost hyperactive sponsoring SyrianIsraeli talks appointing a dozen or more ambassadors to African countries and  most important  suggesting a new Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform Oskanian was intrigued by this proposal but also moderately skeptical Not much that was concrete had been advanced He wanted to see more details A few days later in the International Herald Tribune he embraced it more warmly  noticing in particular that Turkeys leaders have specifically mentioned including Armenia in such a pact  and argued that it might ultimately promote a wider USEuropeTurkishRussian security guaranteeOther experts are more skeptical of the idea Zeyno Baran of the Hudson Institute points out that Turkey recently delayed the passage of US ships heading for Georgia through the straits She fears that the proposed pact would promote a RussoTurkish alliance in the Caucasus at the expense of NATO America and Georgia Maybe Baran has a good record of foresight in such matters On the other hand a Caucasus stability pact would among other things dilute Russian influence over the Caucasus by the simple expedient of increasing Turkish influence It is hard to imagine a RussoTurkish pact lasting long even if one were to be established NATO and the United States are for the moment on the back foot in the Caucasus And something is needed soon to counter and restrain an adventurist troublemaking and resentmentdriven Russia Much may depend on the soccer match on September 6 in Yerevan Perhaps this time the Armenians should plan to lose Tbilisi GeorgiaSeated in an openair restaurant overlooking the River Mtkvari enjoying a light lunch of mountain trout and Georgian salad one finds it hard to believe that Russian tanks are only about 25 kilometers away  indeed that they may be even closer by the time the Turkish coffee arrives Yet Tbilisi has only a few signs of being a capital city at war National flags hang from many buildings Newspapers have ironic antiRussian headlines such as Peacekeepers Go Home Some pavement satirist has sprayed the features of Vladimir Putin on the pathways so that pedestrians tread on his face And so onPosters with a red star and Nazi swastika in front of the Russian Embassy in Tbilisi But there are no bomb shelters No one looks up anxiously at the sky when a plane is heard Refugees head into the capital from South Ossetia for help rather than away from it in panic The city itself is prosperous and modernizing On its central boulevard the old Institute of MarxismLeninism is being redeveloped as a Kempinski Hotel The winding streets and squares of medieval Old Tbilisi are now home to smart restaurants and bars And these are full of seemingly carefree people enjoying themselves well into the small hours As for political life the Georgian government is in place and functioning normally President Mikheil Saakashvili addresses large crowds and hosts distinguished foreign visitors Its ambassadors launch legal suits against Russia at The Hague As I walked into a ministers office for an interview I crossed with a senior official of the European Union emerging from it There is an eeriness about such normality when only a hours drive away Russian soldiers are systematically destroying Georgias military and some civil infrastructure occupying towns and villages establishing buffer zones in Georgia proper to add to their annexation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and arresting Georgian soldiers All in all this is a very postmodern kind of war The Russians have plainly won the military outcome though as yet we know little about how the actual battles went the losses in the air war and so on Equally plainly however they are losing the propaganda war Almost no impartial observer believes their claims of genocide and ethnic cleansing by the Georgians The figures for the civilian dead and wounded in hospitals and morgues are far below the original Russian allegations of thousands that served to justify their military intervention And the Georgian refugees tell horrifying stories in their turn of murders and ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian militias that Russian troops failed to halt Now the Russians may be losing the diplomatic and economic wars tooPoland has already signed the US missile defense deal that Putin has been vehemently opposing NATO has agreed that there cannot be business as usual as long as Russia occupies Georgia Western Europeans are becoming nervous about their dependency on Russian energy China and the Central Asian countries at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit expressed disquiet about the Russian intervention and recognition of the breakaway Georgian provinces A forthcoming European Union summit will at least discuss sanctions against Russia And nervous investors took 16 billion out of Russia in the week following its military success So far these reactions have been mild  too mild in the opinion of critics such as Charles Krauthammer All the same they have prevented the Russians marching to Tbilisi and suiciding Saakashvili So farGeorgians are well aware of these postmodern realities Temur Iakobashvili is their minister for national reintegration  which surely must be the most optimistic ministerial title in history But he is bleakly realistic when I interview him for RFERLHis first point is a concession  yes there was a miscalculation by Georgians when they launched the attack in early August But Georgians were not the only people who miscalculatedWhen I was at a press conference in Brussels in May of this year and I said we were on the brink of war I saw a lot of worried faces coming to me and saying You are using very strong connotation War is a very very strong connotation for the European virgin earIt is so strong a connotation that the Europeans simply averted their eyes from the gathering storm But as Trotsky remarked You may not be interested in war but war is interested in youNow that the war has taken place it is forcing the Western Europeans to revise all their prewar assumptions about the role of Russia the superiority of soft power over hard power the dominant role of economics in international relations and much elseIakobashvili was also realistic about how this postmodern war would be fought I dont see that there is any military component of pressuring Russia but there is a political componentshowing them the political price of not complying with an agreement Here the problem is neither military nor economic but psychological the cultural pessimism and even defeatism of the West My Hudson Institute colleague Charles Fairbanks who lives half the year in Georgia points out that the United States is far more powerful than Russia which has an economy in the range of South Koreas and that superiority has multiplied vastly since we strove successfully against the Soviet Union Only the tunnel vision that comes from immersion in a crisis can conceal this dominant realityGeorgian officials Western businessmen and locally based diplomats feel exactly the same thing sometimes very impatiently On my final night in Tbilisi one Western diplomat outlined the string of financial and economic measures that the West could impose either to alter or frustrate Russian policy Some positive measures  aid and investment programs for Georgia  were already in the pipeline The eventual package might be so generous that Georgia would be halfintegrated into the EU A prosperous independent Georgia still outside Russian control despite the war would significantly weaken Russias influence throughout the Caucasus The stakes of this new great game were very high as an energy company executive said over the same dinner If the Russians remained in Georgia proper they would exercise de facto control of all energy pipelines going from Central Asia to Western Europe If they then forged an alliance with Iran on the Gulf as well these two antiWestern powers would have a chokehold on Europes main energy supplies For the moment however the Russians had limited ability to disrupt and were vulnerable to economic and diplomatic penalties The country was weaker than it looked  overdependent on energy prices needing foreign capital and management skills facing a demographic crisis that ultimately threatened a shortage of Russians The West had at its disposal a series of negative incentives  expulsion from the G8 etc  that could be very effective for the immediate futureBoth positive and negative incentives however required a united West to back them If Europe and America or different European countries split into different camps then the Russians could win this postmodern war And they saw it in such terms Did the West

https://www.rferl.org/a/Georgia_Woes_Ripple_Other_Frozen_Conflicts/1194375.html,Georgia Woes Could Send Ripple Through Other Frozen Conflicts ,"August 27, 2008 15:56 GMT",Separatist leaders in South Ossetia and Abkhazia had been eagerly awaiting a sign from the Kremlin after the Russian parliament urged President Dmitry Medvedev to recognize Georgias two separatist regions ,Separatist leaders in South Ossetia and Abkhazia had been eagerly awaiting a sign from the Kremlin after the Russian parliament urged President Dmitry Medvedev to recognize Georgias two separatist regions They were not disappointedMedvedevs decision the following day August 26 to officially recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia marked a major strategic shift for Moscow Russia has backed both provinces since they broke away from the central Georgian government in the early 1990s But until this week it had stopped short of recognizing their sovereignty and had been a nominal participant in international efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement The move which followed a largescale Russian military operation in South Ossetia this month is sure to have ripple effects on other frozen conflicts areas where Moscow wields considerable influence  Moldovas Transdniester and NagornoKarabakh an Armenianmajority territory located within Azerbaijan Medvedev himself has been quick to draw parallels with the different frozen conflicts simmering in the postSoviet region Certain recent events have shown how dangerous the conflict potential in some frozen conflicts as theyre commonly called can be the Russian president told his Moldovan counterpart Vladimir Voronin on August 25 in Russias Black Sea resort of Sochi in a tacit warning against any attempt by Chisinau to retake its breakaway province by force This became particularly apparent in South Ossetia where as a result of aggressive actions  after Georgias leadership had basically gone crazy  all those problems became exacerbated and essentially an armed conflict took place This is a very serious warning to everybody and I think we should consider other existing problems in this context nowThe South Ossetian conflict has sparked fears in Moldova that Moscow could now move to recognize the independence of Transdniester whose separatist leadership has been pushing for integration with Russia The conflict has given the province new strategic importance since it borders Ukraine  which like Georgia has angered Moscow by seeking closer ties with the West and the NATO military allianceMedvedevs decision to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia has certainly raised hopes of independence in Transdniester and radicalized the stance of its separatist leadership which announced last week it was breaking off all contacts with Moldovan officials until they denounced Georgias aggression against South OssetiaBut Grigory Volovoi who heads a human rights group in Transdniester says the odds of Russia recognizing Transdniester are lowMost people in Transdniester think that since the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was recognized Transdniester can expect the same But the situation is completely different Volovoi says Relations between Moldova and Transdniester lack the ethnic element characteristic of the GeorgianSouth OssetianAbkhaz conflict More importantly Transdniester doesnt have the trump card that Abkhazia and South Ossetia had  a common border with the Russian FederationMoldovas President Voronin right with Medvedev in SochiMedvedev perhaps eager to repair the diplomatic damage caused by Russias heavyhanded actions in Georgia has offered Voronin reassurances that Moscow is still committed to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis I see good prospects of reaching a settlement he said on August 25Voronin appeared receptive to the message likening frozen conflicts to dangerous volcanoes and vowing to prevent a repeat of the violence that rocked South OssetiaPolitical analysts say a quick resolution of the conflict is not on the cards Despite his conciliatory tone and his close ties with Moscow Moldovas Voronin may be reluctant for now to accept a Russianbrokered deal that grants Transdniester broad autonomy  a move that could hurt the popularity of him and his Communist Party at home ahead of next years parliamentary electionsThe deal would also allow Transdniester to secede if Moldova chooses to join neighboring EU member Romania in one stateWatching Closely In Baku YerevanThen there is NagornoKarabakh The disputed territory  which is home to an Armenian majority but lies within Azerbaijans borders  differs from the other frozen conflictsUnlike South Ossetia Abkhazia and Transdniester the population of NagornoKarabakh doesnt hold Russian passports and doesnt seek extensive Russian patronage Rather its goal is outright independence or barring that reintegration with Armenia Officials in both Azerbaijan and Armenia have been notably muted on Russias actions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia Baku is keen to regain control over the disputed territory and has steadily built up its military in an implicit threat to take the region by force But Azerbaijani officials have avoided any harsh statements on Russia in recent weeks perhaps wary of stirring resentment in Moscow Azerbaijani political commentators and journalists however have been much more vocal in denouncing Russias military operation in Georgia I think Russia is capable of repeating this aggression against Azerbaijan by using the conflict in NagornoKarabakh says Vefa Quluzade who served as foreignpolicy adviser to former Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev Its Russia that occupies 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory under Armenias flag its Russia that hampers any step toward a resolution Russia doesnt want this conflict to be settled because it needs this conflict to harass Azerbaijan to get Azerbaijan back into the Russian empireArmenia which has far stronger ties with Russia has been slow to take sides in the RussiaGeorgia conflict Military maneuvers in NagornoKarabakh in 2005Russia helped Armenian forces in the NagornoKarabakh war and has a military base in Armenia Russias efforts to gain a grip on Azerbaijans vast energy resources has also served Armenias interests in NagornoKarabakh by blocking a resolution of the conflict in Azerbaijans favorOn the other hand the landlocked country depends heavily on neighboring Georgia through which the bulk of its imports  including Russian oil  transits Setting a collision course with Tbilisi could also prove disastrous for the 450000 ethnic Armenians currently living in GeorgiaRecent events have raised concerns in Armenia that the Russian offensive in South Ossetia could embolden Azerbaijan to launch a similar military operation to seize NagornoKarabakh But Tom de Waal a Londonbased Caucasus expert says Armenians have no reason to worry for now I think it would actually show them how dangerous it would be to start a war in the Caucasus the amount of destruction that can be caused and how dangerous that could be for Azerbaijan de Waal says I think that would be quite a sobering lessonMedvedevs recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia is nonetheless bound to affect the fate of NagornoKarabakh since Russia together with the United States and France cochairs the Minsk Group a body created by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE to foster a peaceful resolution of the conflictIt will complicate the Karabakh peace process because of the fact that the Russians and the Americans are two out of three mediators de Waal says of a process that has already been dragged out over more than 15 years Russia and the United States have managed to cooperate quite well in the Minsk Group up until now on Karabakh but I think the USRussian relationship is now so bad in the Caucasus that it will be hard for them to trust each other as they have in the past in the Minsk GroupThe World StageRussias recognition of Georgias breakaway regions further soured relations with Washington which has consistently backed Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvilis drive to bring back South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the foldUS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice branded Moscows decision regrettable saying it violated UN Security Council resolutionsPerhaps one of the greatest casualties of Russias intervention in Georgia are the international monitoring bodies that until now played a formal role in determining the fates of the regions disputed territories De Waal says the violent standoff between Russian and Georgian forces over South Ossetia dealt a severe blow to international peace efforts in frozen conflict areasIt has shown that having monitors on the ground means very little if one of the two sides or both the sides want to fight de Waal said The OSCE monitors in South Ossetia were completely irrelevant just as the UN was in Abkhazia  when the Abkhaz wanted to retake the Kodori Gorge they just basically told the United Nations Were going in and youd better get outRFERLs Moldovan Azerbaijani and Armenian services contributed to this report

clout growing faster than a speeding bullet Presidents more powerful than a locomotive Able to ignore demands for political reform at a single bound Look On the shores of the Caspian Nations in transition Developing countries No Its the postSoviet petrostates,Economies and geopolitical clout growing faster than a speeding bullet Presidents more powerful than a locomotive Able to ignore demands for political reform at a single bound Look On the shores of the Caspian Nations in transition Developing countries No Its the postSoviet petrostatesWith oil and gas prices at stratospheric highs these are the new supermen of the international arena nimbly casting off the drab garb of developing transiting and emerging nations to perform astounding feats of outsize influence Four of them have arisen on the territory that was once the Soviet Union Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Russia and Turkmenistan Each reaps a significant portion of GDP from the export of oil and gas and all pose difficulties for Western nations that wish to woo them for their resourcesThe competition for those resources is fierce even as democratic reform in all four countries requires an exceptionally powerful and perhaps uniquely curved magnifying glass to be seen All of this was on display in July with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev touring Azerbaijan Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan while the US Helsinki Commission held hearings on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan wrestling with the vexed issue of resources and reformsMedvedevs southern jaunt on July 36 sought to advance Russian energy policy which pursues two complementary goals in the former imperial hinterlands ensuring a steady supply of gas for the Russian pipeline network and torpedoing alternate export routes The first aim arises because Russia which makes vast sums from its gas exports to Europe and faces declining yields at its current domestic fields has chosen in recent years to buy gas from its southern neighbors instead of investing the huge amounts needed to develop new fields at home The second aim is a natural consequence of Russias desire to establish and maintain its status as a 21stcentury energy superpowerAzerbaijan is unique among the smaller postSoviet petrostates in that it freed itself from export dependence on Russia in the 1990s with the BakuTbilisiCeyhan oil pipeline In Baku then Medvedev pushed a proposal for Russia to buy gas from Azerbaijan which recently began producing enough of the stuff to stop purchasing it from Russia If Russia were to begin acquiring Azerbaijani gas it could boost the gas balance of statecontrolled Russian export monopolist Gazprom while at the same time denying potential supplies to the planned Nabucco pipeline a European project intended to reduce the continents dependence on Russian gas The deal would advance both aims of Russian energy policy For now Baku is mulling the proposalIn Turkmenistan which sends the bulk of its gas exports  some 50 billion cubic meters bcm a year  north through Russia a much smaller quantity goes to Iran Medvedev elicited a rather fuzzy verbal commitment from his Turkmen counterpart Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov to stick to the terms of a 2003 deal between the two countries up through 2025 the official Turkmen news agency reported on July 4 But that deal was supposed to see Turkmen exports to Russia rise to 6070 bcmyear by 2009 a provision that seems unlikely to be met given lackluster production increases in Turkmenistan and the construction of a new Chinesefunded pipeline that is set to come online within three years and eventually move 30 bcmyear 7000 kilometers across Eurasia to ChinaPresidents Berdymukhammedov left and MedvedevTurkmenistan is a small country that gained limited notoriety through the megalomaniacal excesses of former dictator Saparmurat Niyazov who managed to rename the months of the year after himself and members of his family before his death in December 2006 He was succeeded by Berdymukhammedov a dentist whose greatest achievement had been presiding as health minister over the apparently neartotal destruction of the Turkmen healthcare systemLittle of this would matter in the international arena if Turkmenistan were not a petrostate of course with naturalgas reserves coveted from Brussels to Beijing Brussels dreams of securing Turkmen gas shipped across the Caspian to Azerbaijan through a projected undersea pipeline to lessen Europes dependence on Russia Moscow hopes to head this off at the pass and hold on to those same cubic meters And China is already building its new pipeline from Turkmenistan with potentially ominous implications for both European and Russian designsHave Oil Have InfluenceTurkmenistan is a particularly striking example of how petro can catapult any state to the front lines of a global struggle for resources But the same goes for Azerbaijan Kazakhstan and Russia which owe much of their current prestige and prominence to the sudden wealth and winsomeness only oil and gas seem able to confer And they are well aware of this power flexing their newfound muscles at home and abroad in ways that confound and at times confront Western interestsIn an address to Azerbaijani diplomats in early July President Ilham Aliyev harshly rejected Western criticism of Azerbaijans record on human rights and political reforms It is impossible to put pressure on us he said adding If we didnt react to this or were silent a few years ago today we are no longer silent After blasting double standards in the Council of Europe which had warned Azerbaijan a few days earlier of serious steps in the event of a failure to observe democratization obligations in the countrys fall presidential election Aliyev closed his speech with a sarcastically veiled threat I stress that when we joined international organizations we assumed obligations and are fulfilling them If our membership doesnt please someone let them say so What will happen if were not members in some international organization Will Azerbaijan failKazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev was considerably more diplomatic while making a similar point in remarks to the 17th Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe OSCE in Astana on June 29 Kazakhstan is slated to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010 a decision that took Western members some time to make in light of Kazakhstans spotty record on democracy and the OSCEs own past criticism of elections there Touching on democratization only toward the end of his remarks Nazarbaev stressed the importance of national and cultural specifics in reform and insisted that his country will pursue a Kazakh path to a democratic societyMeanwhile as Joanna Lillis noted in a July 22 article on eurasianetorg Nazarbaevs administration has recently presided over an aggressive effort to increase the states control over the oil industry feuded with one international consortium over the development terms of the Kashagan oil field and compelled another to cough up new export dutiesRussia Leading The WayRussia as befits the largest petrostate in the region has gone the farthest on all fronts During the eightyear presidency of Vladimir Putin Moscow made it crystalclear that it would no longer accept pointers on democracy The OSCEs decision to cancel monitoring of Russias 2007 parliamentary elections and 2008 presidential election amid disputes over visas and limitations closed that chapter in Russias relations with the WestRussia has also muscled its way into energy joint ventures with foreign companies and shut off oil and gas shipments to its neighbors at politically sensitive junctures Most recently the British half of the AngloRussian joint venture TNKBP has found itself under attack from a group of four Kremlinfriendly Russian billionaires in a dispute that forced TNKBP head Robert Dudley a British national to flee Moscow for an undisclosed location outside Russia to escape harassment The Times reported on July 31 Meanwhile the Czech Republic saw oil shipments from Russia briefly drop nearly 50 percent after it incurred Moscows ire by agreeing to host elements of a US missiledefense system the International Herald Tribune reported on July 30Nazarbaev in the Kazakh capitalAgainst this backdrop the 2008 Nations in Transit report by Freedom House a USbased NGO warned that oil and gas profits are fueling an assault on democratic governance in the former Soviet Union The report noted that Azerbaijan Kazakhstan and Russia have slid backward on virtually all democratic indicators since 1999 Turkmenistan failed to make this list only because it had no room left for deterioration on democracy by the end of the 1990s Whats more Freedom House argued that the resourcehungry West is facilitating the process Energy needs are increasingly distorting relationships between democracies that consume hydrocarbons and the authoritarian states that produce themThough this view is hardly conventional wisdom among Western policymakers who remain eager to gain and maintain access to Eurasias hydrocarbon wealth the counterpoint came in a July 1 oped in the International Herald Tribune by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger titled Unconventional Wisdom Focusing on the largest and most important of the postSoviet petrostates Kissinger argued that we are witnessing one of the most promising periods in Russian history one rife with opportunities for strategic cooperation between the erstwhile Cold War adversariesKissinger made his case using the same material as Freedom House  governance  but drawing radically different conclusions Surveying the recent anointment of Dmitry Medvedev as successor to Vladimir Putin in a process that resembled a palace intrigue more than a democratic transfer of power Kissinger nonetheless plugged a presidential election that marked a transition from a phase of consolidation to a period of modernization He then concluded The growing complexity of the Russian economy has generated the need for predictable legal procedures A more succinct argument for hydrocarbonfueled authoritarian modernization is hard to imaginePushback Vs ModernizationThese two views  lets call them pushback vs modernization  were in clear view at recent hearings on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan by the US Helsinki Commission with testimony by outside experts arguing either that the countries are pushing back harder and harder against demands for reform or that they are modernizing in their own way at their own paceAt the July 22 hearing  Promises to Keep Kazakhstans 2010 OSCE Chairmanship  Andrea Berg a researcher for Human Rights Watch said the Kazakh government has made almost no concrete progress toward implementing reform pledges in connection with its impending chairmanship At the July 29 hearing  Human Rights and Democratization in Azerbaijan  Christopher Walker director of studies at Freedom House laid out a detailed hardhitting case of new wealth serving to propel and intensify authoritarian practicesMartha Olcott a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment who is one of Washingtons most experienced and respected observers of Kazakh politics advanced a nuanced version of the modernization thesis on July 22 The Kazakhs she said are likely to continue to reform their political system albeit not necessarily at a pace that we try and set for them She concluded that Kazakhstan is in a strategic position has real regional weight and has a sufficiently diverse as well as wealthy economy to be a donor country in most senses of the term This kind of country does not take well to lecturing This leaves us room for attempts at persuasion but mostly the need to hope they make the right choices on their ownThe same goes for the rest of the postSoviet petrostates of course And what it points to is not a disagreement among experts in Washington for the testimony cited here differs primarily in emphasis All of the preceding from the actions of the petrostates themselves to the statements from their leaders to the attempts of experts to clarify the situation for policymakers suggests that the dominant Western paradigm for dealing with the postSoviet world no longer fits the current reality of confidently ascendant petrostatesThe Western paradigm is still premised on the assumption that postSoviet states have both the incentive and the desire to conduct reforms that will aid a transition from the repressive communist past to a future of democratic politics and free markets This paradigm underlies institutional architecture from organizations like the OSCE to democracypromotion efforts funded by Western governments and informs policy which evaluates postSoviet states on their progress in a transition from the dismal past to the hopedfor future In this paradigm authoritarianism is supposed to be a holdover not an outcomeThe problem is that the assumption doesnt hold for postSoviet petrostates With boatloads of money pouring in and more money looming on the horizon what rational incentive is there for a largely unfettered and entrenched ruling elite to fetter its ability to siphon off profits by advancing the rule of law and making itself accountable or increase its chances of losing power by enacting political reforms and holding free and fair elections And with democratic societies the highest per capita consumers of energy what reason is there for policymakers answerable to voters to antagonize energy suppliers in a world of evermorefrenzied competition for access to oil and gasNone of this is particularly new Tomas Carothers hailed the end of the transition paradigm in a January 2002 article for the Journal of Democracy The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about the price of oil and the pace of freedom moving in opposite directions in a MayJune 2006 piece for Foreign Policy titled The First Law of Petropolitics But in Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Turkmenistan and most importantly Russia these trends are coming together in a way that urgently requires a new paradigmNew RealitiesThat paradigm will emerge from the myriad pushes and pulls of reallife realtime policymaking that imperfect amalgam of global trends domestic politics and individual interventions The most an analyst can offer is a guide to the realities we now confront In the postSoviet petrostates they areThe transition from communism is over and it has come to rest on authoritarianism A rapacious elite sits athwart the flow of petrodollars controls the political arena and maintains a veneer of democratic respectability through sham elections that do not offer a real chance for a competitor to come to power The elite has neither the incentive nor the desire to implement reforms that would threaten its economic interests or political power Technocratic modernization is possible but democratization is improbableThe petrostate elites are globally aware and brimming with confidence They know the kind of rhetoric Western democracies want to hear in public forums and will provide it ably on occasion But they are no longer in search of advice and they will be increasingly vocal about their objections to Westernsponsored changeThe era that began with the Helsinki Accords in 1975 is drawing to a close The Helsinki Accords provided a mechanism for the West to support the demands of dissidents in the Eastern Bloc through a formal framework of compliance with the obligations that states assumed This era entered its heyday in the 1990s The comments by Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev quoted above Russias rejection of OSCE election monitoring and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaevs insistence on a Kazakh path to democracy even as his nation prepares to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE all point to its closure In the new era the enforcement of compliance with Westernsponsored obligations on democratization and human rights will be a less and less important component of international affairsThese are the factors that will shape a new paradigm for dealing with postSoviet petrostates We cannot be sure whether it will emerge or what it will look like if it does but if it is to meet the challenges of todays world it should include the followingAn end to the pretense of transition When Western officials tout the imaginary successes of transitions that have not in fact taken place the resulting impression of hypocrisy and naivete undermines efforts to promote democracy abroad The authoritarian leaders of petrostates are increasingly outspoken Reciprocity is called forStrong publicly articulated arguments to explain why democracy is a better system of government than authoritarianism  because it calls rapacious elites to account safeguards individual rights makes real change possible and ensures an orderly transfer of power The time when democracys allure could be assumed has passed Petrostates are enjoying temporary economic security while their elites are using statecontrolled media to present this as the justification for permanent authoritarian rule An intellectual counterattack is neededAn honest admission of national interest Western democracies should be clear that they support the spread of democracy not simply out of principle but also because it advances their national interests  relations between states founded on common values and the rule of law are stronger and more stable and business more easily conducted Western prestige has declined sharply in the postSoviet world since the heady days of the early 1990s and arguments premised on altruism will fall on deaf earsNew strategies to promote democracy Much of the infrastructure that emerged in the 1990s to support reform through international organizations and local NGOs assumed that the postSoviet powers that be had at least a grudging willingness to change That condition no longer holds and the democracypromotion community will have to engage in wideranging reassessments and collective brainstorming to come up with new approachesContingency plans for the failure of petroauthoritarianism Petrostates often fall into socalled robust authoritarianism that can last for decades but the first law of the authoritarian polity is that it is perfectly stableuntil its not We will be far better placed to deal with the unpredictable challenges of petroauthoritarianism gone awry if we realize sooner rather than later that while crisis and collapse may seem improbable

https://www.rferl.org/a/How_Can_the_Human_Rights_Situation_In_Armenia_Be_Improved/1188181.html,How Can The Human Rights Situation In Armenia Be Improved ,"August 03, 2008 14:31 GMT",,Two years ago on February 17 2006 the Armenian parliament elected me as its first human rights defender ombudsman with over 60 percent of the vote   The institution of ombudsman in Armenia is still in the formation stage due to the unfortunate fact that here  as in many other former Soviet republics  neither the government nor the population at large fully acknowledge the crucial role it can and should play in public life   One of the ombudsmans most important duties is to systematically identify and bring to public attention both serious abuses of human rights and instances of maladministration From the very beginning of my sixyear term I have raised those issues in my annual and ad hoc reports at interim press conferences and in specific recommendations to the government Sometimes the response is constructive cooperation but on some occasions the authorities disregard my conclusions and recommendations or create artificial obstacles to implementing my recommendations   Such obstructionism is shortsighted counterproductive and risks undermining peoples trust in national institutions At the international level it can be damaging to Armenias national interests Noncompliance by government agencies with my offices recommendations generally results in Armenian citizens taking their cases to the European Court of Human Rights That court has received about 1000 complaints against the Republic of Armenia since 2002 and has handed down 16 rulings to date   True we have made some progress But I cannot consider the situation satisfactory as long as some government institutions ignore their duty to observe basic human rights For example my office receives numerous complaints about the tendency of the ProsecutorGenerals Office to insist that suspects be remanded in pretrial custody even when the outcome of their case could not possibly be affected by permitting the accused to remain at liberty pending trial I have called in my annual reports for 2006 and 2007 and most recently at a press conference on July 11 for an end to this unacceptable practice  which is a leftover from the Soviet criminal justice system  but without success   Even more serious is the problem of double standards and the selective implementation of justice An analysis of complaints addressed to my office shows that court officials frequently refrain from using their right to enforce the compulsory penalty prescribed by law when the debtor is a state entity or official Approximately 80 percent of court rulings in which a city mayor a regional governor or a police officer are recognized as debtors are either not enforced at all or are enforced only after a considerable delay   This is a clear violation of the principle of equality before the law Many officials affirm their commitment to universal values such as freedom human dignity and equality but in practice often flout these values For that reason it is incumbent on the state to create all the political social and legal safeguards needed to guarantee human rights and freedoms in practice   In Armenia as in many other transition countries an oligarchic system of governance has taken root that to a considerable extent controls the media political parties and state institutions That economic elite then set about trying to supplant the political elite Business and politics merged into a single corporate group within which the same persons functioned as both businessmen and politicians or statesmen Business figures became powerful enough to exert a decisive influence on public policy either through personal connections or by successfully lobbying their personal interests At the same time entities outside those oligarchic groups were effectively deprived of any possibility of engaging in economic activity This has disproportionately widened the income gap between different segments of society and precluded the formation of a middle class that could become the social basis of state stability   Those negative trends have undermined the key principle of democracy that there are no rights without responsibilities and no responsibilities without rights Today rights are concentrated in the hands of a small group of people while responsibilities are binding for the majority of society   I believe that the recent developments in Armenia  specifically the crackdown that followed the February 19 presidential election  were conditioned by the harsh governing system the overcentralization of power an artificial system of checks and balances social and economic polarization the fusion of business with government the absence of any public control over the authorities and a deficiency of civil liberties All this has resulted in the estrangement of one large part of society from the government and its total lack of trust in public institutions electoral mechanisms the judicial system and the media   It is a regrettable fact that in the Republic of Armenia as in the majority of transition countries domestic stability is usually achieved through the dominance of one institution of power such as the presidency rather than a system of checks and balances between the three branches of power Today Armenian society faces a choice to develop by strengthening democratic values and institutions or to reinforce authoritarian trends in power thereby widening even further the gap between the authorities and the majority of society   Reporting to parliament three months ago on the combination of circumstances that led to the violent clashes in Yerevan on March 12 between police and protesters I argued that at a minimum we need to create a framework in which government officials can be held publicly accountable and in which a strong opposition can function freely without taking to the streets reform election legislation guarantee the pluralism and impartiality of the electronic media and eliminate economic monopolies as a first step towards dismantling the oligarchic system of government Doing so would reduce the current polarization of society that constitutes a breeding ground for political extremism There can be no halfmeasures At this juncture to imitate reforms would be both pointless and dangerous   Armen Harutyunyan has served since February 2006 as Armenias humanrights ombudsman The views expressed in this commentary are the authors own

Armenia can be summed up in the single phrase the launch by a decisive statesman of a policy that inspires hope ,Serzh Sarkisians first 100 days as president of Armenia can be summed up in the single phrase the launch by a decisive statesman of a policy that inspires hope Of course 100 days is too short a period to solve the numerous problems which the country faces problems which require longterm and consistent work But it is long enough to outline to both the political elite and society at large the optimum path of development given that there is no alternative to democracy in ArmeniaAt his swearingin ceremony on April 9 President Sarkisian declared the need to tackle Armenias problems and he has already set about doing so He has stressed the need for transparency in internal policy and for effective measures to target corruption He has tried not only in his public pronouncements but also through the work of his team to gradually create an atmosphere of trust and justice Some legislative restrictions on public meetings marches and rallies have been lifted A new parliamentary commission has been formed to investigate the violent clashes between police and demonstrators in Yerevan on March 1 Opposition politicians now appear more frequently on television Tax and customs bodies have begun working more openlyThese measures are not purely cosmetic the Armenian authorities are not trying simply to create a good impression These 100 days showed that the Armenian authorities understand better than anybody else the problems our country faces and that those problems have given rise to popular discontent The Armenian government has enough willpower to implement radical changes in order to create a developed and democratic Armenia Armenian society has emerged from the postelection period What is needed now is for the authorities and the opposition to join forces and combine their efforts We need a strong Armenia and not violent social upheavalPresident Sarkisian has affirmed that none of those arrested in connection with the March 1 violence should be sentenced simply for their political views He appealed to the courts to be impartial and to differentiate clearly between serious criminals and those who have committed only minor infractions The fact that many people taken into custody in the wake of the violence have been discharged and others released on bail speaks for itself The authorities have rejected political repression in favor of developing democracy step by stepIn line with his election manifesto Sarkisian has shown himself equally decisive and consistent in the realm of foreign policy He has abandoned the passive reactive foreign policy of the past decade for one that is proactive Vivid proof of this was his invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to attend the soccer match between the Turkish and Armenian national teams in Yerevan on September 6 an initiative that demonstrates the readiness of the Republic of Armenia to establish diplomatic relations with Ankara Sarkisians political evolution has led him to understand that there can no longer be closed borders Nearly two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall building new walls will benefit no oneMany people evaluate Sarkisians most recent steps toward democracy as undertaken only under pressure in response to two successive Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe resolutions condemning the Armenian authorities response to the Yerevan violence But I must stress that the aim of the Armenian leadership is to develop the country by implementing Sarkisians preelection program It is equally important to remember that even the most democratic states would need a long time to come to terms with the kind of tragedy we experienced on March 1 Personally I would be very happy if the radical opposition opted for constructive cooperation and dialogue but unfortunately they show no signs of doing so They have not delegated a representative to participate in the work of the ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 1 violence arguing that it is incapable of delivering an impartial assessment Zharangutiun Heritage the only opposition party represented in parliament has declined the offer to chair one of parliaments standing committees But the Armenian leadership cannot achieve democracy and progress on its own it takes two hands to applaud Democracy must strengthen its positions in the field of law by respecting the constitution In every country the constitution serves to reconcile the need to protect the basic freedoms of the individual with the need to maintain law and order It means wherever one persons freedom ends a second persons rights begin All members of society ought to accept those inherent restrictions It is not fortuitous that the president has repeatedly appealed for a dialogue between the authorities and societyDuring the first 100 days of the Sarkisian presidency the radicals have continued their destructive activities They continue to disseminate inaccurate factual information and deliberately misleading assessments of the governments activities just as they did during the runup to the February 19 presidential election and in the weeks that followed And they denounce as bureaucrats those of our European colleagues who hail the progress Armenia has made during

https://www.rferl.org/a/Abkhazia_Bryza_Nagorno_Karabakh_Turkey_Armenia/1185188.html,Bryza Does Russia Wish To Be A Facilitator Or A Party To Conflict ,"July 21, 2008 15:31 GMT",,Georgia and Russia are eyeing each other warily over Abkhazia There are rumblings about rapprochement between Armenia and Turkey Peace talks on NagornoKarabakh are gaining fresh momentumThe volatile South Caucasus has been making more than its share of news recently and Matthew Bryza the US deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs has been in the center of the actionBryza spoke on July 18 with RFERLs Brian Whitmore about the developments in this explosive and strategically important region   RFERL Theres currently a lot of movement on Georgia and Abkhazia German Foreign Minister FrankWalter Steinmeier is engaging in a bit of shuttle diplomacy between Georgia Abkhazia and Russia to push that peace plan Can we expect to see movement on this issue given that each side has already rejected key components of the plan   Matthew Bryza I am just beginning to see the press reports on the Steinmeier visit and it looks like the Abkhaz side echoed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovs statement yesterday July 17 extremely unhelpfully and rejected the core concept of what it takes to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Abkhazia conflict That is the link of Georgia issuing a nonuseofforce pledge with the return of internally displaced Georgians to Abkhazia   That is the absolutely essential bargain that must be struck to be able to move a peace process forward So I think were quite worried when Abkhazia echoed by Moscow says they wont now agree to that bargain which we have talked about for years It makes me think that somebody wants to scuttle this goodfaith effort by the UN Friends for Georgia grouping Britain France Germany Russia and the United States and by the German foreign minister not to mention by the US secretary of state who was in Tbilisi last week and all of us in the UN Friends process to which I am the US representative   So those are very worrisome public statements coming out of both Sukhumi and Moscow and I hope its just posturing I hope we will get back to where we were during my own visit to Tbilisi and Sukhumi in May which was quite close to an announcement of a bargain or the outlines of a bargain or a deal based on what I said before  the pledge not to use force on the Georgian side and the pledge that Georgian IDPs internally displaced people could return to Abkhazia And then we would hope that there would be a deescalation of the military tension in the sensitive AbkhazianGeorgian region of the Kodori Valley   Not A Good Faith Set Of PreconditionsRFERL The Georgians have also rejected signing the nonuseofforce pledge arguing that this would constitute sort of a de facto recognition of Abkhazias statehood But a lot of people are interpreting that as posturing Do you find the Georgian position unhelpful in this regard   Bryza What the Georgians have said is we are not going to issue a nonuseofforce pledge as a precondition for starting direct negotiations with the Abkhaz The Russian position and the Abkhaz position is the same There cannot be direct peace talks unless the Georgians issue the nonuseofforce pledge as a precondition and unless the Georgians pull out their police from the Kodori Valley which is sovereign Georgian territory   It is impossible for any negotiating party to agree to the core elements of the bargain that needs to be struck as a precondition for launching the negotiations That is not a goodfaith set of preconditions The Georgians have clearly said that of course they are willing to issue that nonuseofforce pledge as part of a broader bargain  that I outlined a moment ago  during direct negotiations with the Abkhaz and the Georgians I just cant understand how anybody who is in favor of peace could possibly say at this moment of high tension regarding the Abkhazia conflict that there ought to be preconditions to the Abkhaz and Georgians sitting down for direct talks I think Tbilisi shares that view but that is US policy   RFERL Russia appears to be playing two roles in this process One official as a member of the Friends group the other unofficial as the de facto patron of the Abkhaz side Can Russia be an honest broker in this situation   Bryza Thats a fair question We have said clearly that Russias behavior since April 16 when the Kremlin issued instructions for the Russian government to strengthen its ties to the separatist regions of Georgia that those actions undercut Russias role as facilitator of the UN Friends process And Russia took further steps that undercut its role as the facilitator when it shot down the Georgian unmanned aerial vehicle UAV on April 20 and then moved paratroopers with heavy artillery into Abkhazia without consulting Georgia which violates the 1994 Moscow ceasefire agreement Not to mention that the shootdown is a violation of the UN Charter And just as we got Georgia to a point where it was deescalating by not flying any more of those UAVs the next day Russia sent in rail construction troops without consulting the Georgians again   So every step of the way when weve worked with the Georgians meticulously to get them to deescalate the Russian side has decided to take a very provocative step And so if thats the way it is going to behave and still be a member of the Friends process it is very difficult practically to get the Friends process to move forward and to finalize this useful paper that our German coordinator of the Friends helped us agree upon back on June 30 in BerlinSo you ask a core question And the question really is to put it in a different way Does Russia wish to behave as the facilitator of the Friends process or as a mediator rather than as a party to the conflict That is an open question   RFERL Georgia wants Russia out of the UN Friends Group but I dont know that the United States have gotten officially to that point yet   Bryza Definitely not Russia has to be part of the process its just inevitable Russia has the peacekeepers on the ground Russia is geographically contiguous to Abkhazia Russia is trying to use Abkhazia as a construction site or colony for the Sochi Olympics Russia is going to be part of the game and frankly the Abkhaz look toward Russia today for security  physical security economic security political securitySo the way out of this cant be that Russia is not part of the process that is absolutely impossible We want Russia in the process    The way out of this is that the international community and most importantly Georgia provides the Abkhaz with those types of security  physical economic cultural and political What I mean by the latter is that for any agreement to resolve the Abkhazia conflict 250000 Georgian internally displaced persons will have to return to Abkhazia and there are only 55000 or so Abkhaz So when those Georgians come back the Abkhaz must not be worried about being overwhelmed politically or culturally Their cultural rights need to be preserved and of course they need to retain some kind of disproportionate political role in Abkhazia just as weve negotiated in Bosnia for minorities there and just as weve talked about in Cyprus or as Kofi Annan had incorporated into his Cyprus settlement plan    No Restrictions No PreconditionsRFERL The United States has its own proposal to replace or supplement the peacekeeping mission with an international police force Is this plan working in concert with the Friends Group plan   Bryza Yes everything we do aims to support the Friends process and at the same time get direct talks going between Abkhazia and Georgia If one of the Friends has decided it is against AbkhazGeorgian direct talks then that party is making it impossible for the Friends agenda to be realized and we are still going to do everything we possibly can to get the Abkhaz and the Georgians to be able to talk face to face with no restrictions and no preconditions But we believe that by so doing we are actually moving the Friends process forward because thats the only way you can fulfill the Friends mandate of trying to resolve the conflict    We are also working to try to implement or further develop Phase One of this Friends plan So everything weve been doing  when Secretary Condoleezza Rice was in Tbilisi and my boss Assistant Secretary Daniel Fried was there which led to this talk of some other US paper  is really an attempt to get phase one of this Friends plan moving The Phase One focuses on military deescalation    Georgia President Mikheil SaakashviliSo were supporting the Friends process Our proposal is definitely  at this point at least  not to replace the CIS peacekeepers Thats an issue that has to be worked out between Georgia and Russia in the context of the existing agreements The 1994 Moscow ceasefire agreement calls for the consent of the host government as do CIS documents So Georgia and Russia have to work out the status of the CIS peacekeepers    Were not calling for the removal of the CIS peacekeepers thats not our business we have said in Security Council resolutions that we encourage cooperation between CIS peacekeepers and the UN observer mission in Georgia That said we do definitely see the need for some security capabilities to complement the CIS peacekeepers  not necessarily to replace but to complement Why Because in the Gali district in southern Abkhazia Georgia there is a serious lawenforcement problem The Abkhaz police are unable to provide law enforcement for the population there which is where the largest concentration of ethnic Georgians are the CIS peacekeepers dont have a mandate there Something has to happen there needs to be a capability    What we could see there could be a joint Georgian and Abkhaz police with international oversight be it UN or EU oversight Back up in the Kodori Valley similarly there could be joint Georgian and Abkhaz police that have strong international oversight in the form of the EU or the UN So were trying to think through whether or not these models are workable as a way to complement the existing CIS peacekeepers    RFERL The US and Georgia are holding joint military exercises near Tbilisi and Russia is conducting military exercises in the North Caucasus Both sides said these exercises were planned a long time ago But some commentators said that with tensions so high this isnt really a good idea Do you think these exercises harm help or are neutral as far as the peace process goes   Bryza I cant comment on Russian plans or motivations What I can say is that we had had this exercise planned for a couple of years In fact the participants are not just the US and Georgia it is also Azerbaijan Armenia and Ukraine as part of the NATO Partnership for Peace partners effort We do one such annual exercise in some country among the NATO PfP partners and this year it had just so happened to fall to Georgia    Our decision was do we cancel it or do we go ahead after Russia turned up the pressure on Abkhazia And our decision was we should go ahead this was planned for a long long time It is mostly a tabletop exercise in Tbilisi there arent massive maneuvers planned its much more modest than what Ive heard is going on on the Russian side in the North Caucasus I would hope it enhances security throughout the region by helping to increase the professionalization and cooperation of all these military forces professionalism is of course the key to military security    Effort Under Way That Is GenuineRFERL Lets take a look at Armenia The new president Serzh Sarkisian has published a comment in The Wall Street Journal intimating that a rapprochement with Turkey is in the works He invited Turkish President Abdullah Gul to Armenia to watch a football match in September And now Turkish newspapers are reporting that Turkish and Armenian officials recently held secret talks in Bern Do you think something is up   I can say with some confidence that yes there is an effort under way that is genuine in both Yerevan and Ankara to try to normalize relations between the two countries Bryza Yes I do I was just in Yerevan a week and a half ago and saw President Sarkisian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian I was with the foreign minister extensively during his visit in Washington this week We spent a couple hours together over lunch And then I was in Ankara last week on Thursday and Friday July 1011 meetings with the prime minister and deputy foreign minister and the Caucasus team and the prime ministers adviser on foreign policy and the military So I think I have a pretty good feel for what people are thinking and can say with some confidence that yes there is an effort under way that is genuine in both Yerevan and Ankara to try to normalize relations between the two countries RFERL Are we to assume that Gul will accept Sarkisians invitation    Bryza I sure hope so I certainly cannot speak for President Gul or the Turkish government but we sure hope that he does takes advantage of this golden opportunity to use an international event that just is a gift on the calendar to advance all these processes that Ive just mentioned   I should also recognize that President Sarkisian took a courageous step by inviting President Gul and then also by talking about the possibility of a historical commission which engendered a lot of opposition and criticism from Armenian politicians who used to call for those very same steps   RFERL Russia seems to be taking the lead on this possible detente Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has traveled recently to Armenia and Turkey Sarkisian was in Moscow when he made his invitation to Gul Is it acting in concert with the United States    Bryza I dont know of any single step the Russian government has taken to encourage rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia Thats not a critical statement thats just a statement of fact So I am taken aback by the notion that Russia is somehow leading in this effort Turkey and Armenia are doing this themselves Maybe the Russians are saying things quietly behind the scenes I dont know Im completely unaware of that   RFERL One analyst weve spoken to  someone who follows these things really closely  said he thinks the Russian diplomats got the order to surpass the American initiative on this one   Bryza Great Great if they did I havent seen any evidence thereof but wed welcome it If Russia is encouraging rapprochement between these two countries that would be a terrific thing   RFERL Were your recent trips to Turkey and Armenia tied to the rapprochement talks or was this just a routine visit   Bryza Whenever I go to these places there are just so many items on the agenda And so agenda items include energy  I was in Turkey with US Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy Boyden Gray And then all the stuff I do bilaterally with Turkey  of which Armenia and reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia is a toplevel issue as are general issues in the Caucasus and Georgia   So we talked about that Cyprus Turkeys EU accession and the domestic situation in Turkey and of course our cooperation with Turkey in Iraq not only against terrorists but also to facilitate the participation by Sunnis in the political life in Iraq So theres a lot on the agenda in Turkey   In Armenia I went there also with TurkeyArmenia rapprochement as an issue but primarily of course in my capacity as a Minsk Group cochair to focus on NagornoKarabakh And of course the domestic political situation as Armenia recovers from the problems with the elections and the tragic aftermath   Talks Actually Are JumpStartedRFERL The TurkishArmenian relationship is of course bound up in the NagornoKarabakh talks But those negotiations appear to be stalled Is there any way to get them jumpstarted    The talks actually are jumpstarted We dont talk so openly about whats happening and so I wouldnt expect folks on the outside to know the degree of movement thats under wayBryza The talks actually are jumpstarted We dont talk so openly about whats happening and so I wouldnt expect folks on the outside to know the degree of movement thats under way but on June 6 the presidents Sarkisian and Ilham Aliyev had their first meeting in St Petersburg and the statements that they made afterward were indicative of a process that is indeed full of life President Aliyev said that the two presidents established a certain degree of trust in each other which was amazing And President Sarkisian echoed that And then both presidents called on the Minsk Group to reinvigorate its actions now that the Armenian elections are over And both presidents called on us the Minsk Group cochairs to work with their foreign ministers to try to bridge the gaps in the remaining couple of issues out there in the Basic Principles that were proposed by us cochairs back in November in Madrid   So obviously that was a key focus of Foreign Minister Nalbandians visit here in Washington and we the Minsk Group cochairs are going to get together with the foreign ministers again I hope its going to be on the 31st of July or 1st of August in Moscow So the process is going yeah The question is of course can the two sides bridge the gaps on the final couple of issues Of those issues a few of them are quite easily resolvable and then one or one and a half will require some tough compromises   RFERL Can you tell us any more about these outstanding issues   Bryza I cant because that would not be fair to the negotiators themselves   RFERL But what you seem to be suggesting is that theres movement on NagornoKarabakh and movement on a TurkeyArmenia detente Is something really big going on   Bryza I dont know Youve got wheels that are turning but wheels that may not lead to a resolution of any of these issues But diplomacy is about both process and results And the art of diplomacy is using the process to help parties who think they cant find common ground to find that common ground So Im feeling positive momentum as a result of the process but it would be a little bit reckless to predict a positive outcome  or a negative one for that matter Weve got to keep our noses collectively to the grindstone and embrace this positive momentum and try to channel it toward the results we seek   RFERL We all know there have been a lot of false starts on this How optimistic are you right now compared to previous times when we thought progress was at hand on this issue   Bryza I guess I remain kind of skesimistic We invented that term skesimistic in our Minsk Group Lots of skepticism and optimism as well I dont know if I can quantify it but I can say the prerequisites on Karabakh for reaching agreement on the basic principles may be falling into place   The two presidents seem to have a certain level of trust in each other and have demonstrated a readiness to engage in a giveandtake that does take into account each sides needs and interests Those are the key prerequisites But that is not a guarantee that the final differences are bridgeable In any negotiation on something as sensitive and complex as NagornoKarabakh its the last issue or the last couple issues that are often the hardest to resolve So I cant predict what will happen but I am paid to be an optimist and I feel that those who pay me for that optimism are being well served   We Have Seen Some ProgressRFERL Before we move on to issues pertaining to Azerbaijan is there anything you would like to add about Armenia Turkey and Karabakh   Bryza Yes there is President Sarkisian came into office under very difficult circumstances an election that was questioned and unprecedented postelection violence for the South Caucasus on March 1 and 2 He faces really serious challenges but he seems to understand what these challenges are and I personally have confidence in his ability to address those problems which still require some work   Armenian President Serzh SarkisianWhat those are are arrests of opposition politicians opposition activists for their participation in the events of March 1 and 2 There still is a political divide between the government and opposition that we would like to see closed There are still some restrictions on freedom of assembly So all those issues need to be worked through   We really want to see the release of those activists and politicians who are still under arrest There are some trials pending for people who were arrested on March 1st and 2nd for political reasons We would like to see all that go away and be resolved in accordance with the rule of law and democratic principles   Again though that all said we do sense that the president Sarkisian does recognize these serious challenges and the need to restore democratic principles We have seen some progress on rule of law in the economic sphere under his prime minister Tigran Sarkisian  same surname no relationship So overall the domestic situation in Armenia is hopefully on a more positive trajectory   There will be a big decision that our Millennium Challenge corporation will have to take  I mean the board will need to take  in September about whether to continue the program And the board decided in June to follow a waitandsee approach and hope that the at that time very nascent signs of a restoration of democratic momentum will gain their own momentum I hope that is what we are now seeing but it is too early to tell   I think that it is by virtue of restoring the democratic momentum that Armenia will become more confident and more able to advance the NagornoKarabakh peace process Just as I would argue that rapprochement with Turkey should also help Armenia become more able to be more flexible in the negotiations And we want to see the same thing happen on the Azerbaijani side   We hope that as these processes move forward Azerbaijan will see it in itself to use its burgeoning economic wealth as a way to bring the parties together rather than increase any sort of tension And as far as using wealth to build understanding President Aliyev has actually shown that vision and we commend him for thatAzerbaijani President Ilham AliyevRFERL Azerbaijans presidential election is scheduled for October Do you think the current environment in that country with so many journalists in prison and the atmosphere of intimidation so strong is conducive to free and fair electionsBryza President Ilham Aliyev seems to understand the importance of conducting an election that the international community recognizes as free and fair That goal is a central focus of our relationship with Azerbaijan with his government and with him So we hope that his election will prove to be just that    Its true however that the arrests of journalists what people are reporting as harassment of them and limitations on freedom of assembly work against the perception and perhaps the reality that the election will be free and fair We have been working through our embassy and our assistance programs that are managed here and in Baku to try to get the mechanisms of democracy of an election in place so that the election will be as free and fair as possible    I cant handicap what the outcome will be now but I can say that as in Armenia where we had an unprecedented level of violence after the election  an election that was questioned  so do we want to make sure that the procedures are in place to make sure this election is seen as free and fair as possible    RFERL How much leverage does the United States have to get these journalists out of prison   Bryza I dont know how to assess how much leverage we have I can just say that getting these people out of jail is a high priority its something we work on every day  I do and our ambassador does We need to be constantly pushing on that issue I should just add that Azerbaijan is an important friend of the United States  Azerbaijan overall the entire country We have a lot of important issues on the agenda    We have three key sets of strategic interests  expansion of political and economic freedom to reform or democratic and market economic reform security cooperation and of course energy cooperation with Azerbaijan We need to be moving forward in all three sets of those interests and encouraging Azerbaijans evolution toward democracy as a key element We know that in the long run stability will come from legitimacy which requires free and fair elections So thats what were pushing toward

diplomacy to defuse longstanding tensions with neighboring Turkey,Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian has decided to try a little football diplomacy to defuse longstanding tensions with neighboring TurkeyDuring a visit to Moscow in June Sarkisian made waves by publicly announcing that he would like his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to come to Yerevan to watch a World Cup qualifying soccer match between the two countries in SeptemberThe Armenian leader repeated the invitation in a commentary titled We Are Ready To Talk To Turkey published in the US daily The Wall Street Journal on July 9 There is no real alternative to the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between our countries Sarkisian wrote It is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold to this new open doorThe Turkish Foreign Ministry says it is studying the proposalThe sports element lends Sarkisians overture a tantalizing historical appeal evoking memories of the pingpong diplomacy of the 1970s  when an exchange of tabletennis teams helped set the stage for eventual rapprochement between the United States and ChinaBut what caused many observers to wonder aloud whether the current initiative might just lead to something serious was Russias apparent willingness to throw its diplomatic weight behind the idea  and grab the mantle on an issue where US diplomats have until now played the leading role Russian diplomats have been given the task of moving beyond the American initiative to normalize ArmenianTurkish relations David Hovhannisyan a former Armenian diplomat and Yerevanbased political analyst saysHovhannisyan adds that it is highly unlikely that Sarkisian would have made his dramatic gesture in Moscow without his hosts consent Moreover just a week after Sarkisians visit to Moscow Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Istanbul with the Armenia issue reportedly part of his agendaAdding to the air of anticipation Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian flew to Washington for an official visit this weekMoscow has developed a good relationship with Ankara and being able to continue to develop that relationship without complications emanating from its support for Yerevan would be something that I think the Russian government would welcome says Bulent Aliriza director of the Turkey Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in WashingtonMosaic Of DistrustTurkeys frosty relations with Armenia however are part of a larger mosaic of deep animosities historical grievances and bitter tensions that have long plagued the regionTurkey was among the first countries to recognize Armenian independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union But when Armenian forces occupied Azerbaijans NagornoKarabakh region Ankara broke off diplomatic ties with Yerevan and closed its border with Armenia Most analysts say it is highly unlikely that Turkey would make any moves toward rapprochement with Armenia without Azerbaijans consent  making ArmenianTurkish reconciliation tightly bound to a settlement of the NagornoKarabakh issueMoreover Yerevans claim that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I constitutes genocide is angrily rejected by Turkey and continues to be a major roadblock in normalizing relations In an attempt to entice Istanbul Sarkisian has offered to have a joint commission of Armenian and Turkish scholars investigate the claimsObservers in Turkey nevertheless remain skepticalTurkeys president Abdullah GulIt looks like Armenia seriously wants to negotiate but as far as we see there is no change in their position on Karabakh or on questions of Turkeys territorial integrity Omer Lutem head of the Armenia department at the Istanbulbased Eurasian Strategic Research Center told RFERLs Azerbaijani Service in a recent interview Will they give up on their claims of genocide or will they fight Will they make changes or not It is not clear If there will not be any changes how will the question be resolvedAlizira agreed that untangling this web and resolving these issues would prove to be a complicated task There have been a lot of false dawns on this front he saidBut some observers say that the politics of the region at this particular time gives Moscow plenty of incentives to try Moscows MotivesRussia has been steadily losing influence in the South Caucasus in recent years Relations with Georgia are embroiled in deep hostility over the proMoscow separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and over Tbilisis bid to join NATO Azerbaijan whose energy wealth grants it a degree of independence from Moscow is increasingly looking West as well Russia maintains a large degree of influence in Armenia where it maintains a military base and has invested heavily  particularly in the energy sector Alexander Iskandarian director of Caucasus Media Institute in Yerevan calls Armenia Russias only trusted partner in the South Caucasus adding that it is not in Russias interests to have such an ally isolated with its borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan closed Moreover Russian firms investing in Armenia badly want the border opened so they can use the country as a springboard to expand into markets throughout the region and beyondWhen Russia was in a different position in the South Caucasus the fact that Armenia was so isolated wasnt so troublesome Since the situation has changed Russia is less satisfied with this situation Iskandarian says If the road to Turkey were open and it will open if there would be normal diplomatic relations Russian capital here could use this It could go to the Turkish market export goods and services And Russian capital and Russian investment in Armenia is not small This opens possibilities and makes entry into the Southern European and Middle Eastern markets cheaperTotal Russian investment in Armenia reached 12 billion this year A spinoff company of Russias former electricity monopoly Unified Energy Systems operates Armenias only nuclear power plant and would like to use Armenias grid to sell power to Turkey and elsewhere in the region The statecontrolled naturalgas monopoly Gazprom owns a majority stake in Armenias gasdistribution network Russian investment is also heavy in the banking and gaming sectors Questions remain however about whether Russia has enough over Turkey and Armenia to broker a dealI dont think that they have much leverage on the Turkish side of the fence and Im not sure how much leverage they have on the Armenian side of the fence Aliriza says Secondly the RussianTurkish relationship which is so important to Moscow and to Ankara for so many reasons is not going to be a function of the TurkishArmenian relationship from Moscows point of view

shift President Serzh Sarkisian has confirmed he is ready to accept in principle Turkeys proposal to form a commission of Armenian and Turkish historians that would examine the 191518 mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire,Signaling a major policy shift President Serzh Sarkisian has confirmed he is ready to accept in principle Turkeys proposal to form a commission of Armenian and Turkish historians that would examine the 191518 mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman EmpireSarkisian on June 26 made clear through a spokesman however that such a commission should be created only after Turkey agrees unconditionally to establish diplomatic relations and open its border with Armenia But on June 30 the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD one of four parties represented in the coalition government joined other opposition parties in criticizing Sarkisians support for the Turkish proposalThe proposal for a joint commission was formally made by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a 2005 letter to thenArmenian President Robert Kocharian Erdogan suggested that the proposed commission determine whether the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire constituted genocide and said his government would accept any conclusion it reachedIn a written reply Kocharian effectively rejected the idea and came up with a counterproposal to set up a TurkishArmenian intergovernmental commission that would deal with this and other issues of mutual concern Other Armenian officials backed by local and diaspora scholars dismissed Erdogans move as a Turkish ploy designed to scuttle international recognition of the Armenian genocide They also said that by agreeing to the proposed study the Armenian side would signal a willingness to consider doubts regarding the genocide questionWe are not against the creation of such a commission but only if the border between our countries is opened Sarkisian declared during a visit to Moscow last week His press secretary Samvel Farmanian reaffirmed this in a statement issued on June 26 We are not against any study of even obvious facts and widely accepted realities Farmanian said Agreeing to a study does not mean casting doubt on the veracity of facts However the creation of such a commission would be logical only after the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of the border between our countries Otherwise it could become a tool for dragging out and exploiting existing problemsArmenias leading opposition groups including the Popular Movement headed former President Levon TerPetrossian were quick to condemn Sarkisians comments saying that by accepting Ankaras proposal in principle he called into question the very fact of what many historians regard as the first genocide of the 20th century Farmanian rejected that argument It is strange that the genocide issue is being exploited by individuals who had done everything in the past to condemn that tragic page of our history to oblivion he said in a jibe at the more conciliatory line that TerPetrossian adopted visavis TurkeyThe opposition concerns have since been echoed by the HHD which has for decades been known for its hard line on Armenias relations with Turkey The partys official position is that Turkey must not only admit to the genocide but also compensate the descendants of victims and cede large swathes of its formerly Armenianpopulated territory to Armenia Successive Armenian governments have stressed however that Armenia has no formal territorial claims on Turkey Genocide recognition by Turkey will not lead to legal consequences for territorial claims Kocharian stated in a 2001 interview with a Turkish TV stationWe have received the necessary explanation and clarification from the president Giro Manoyan a spokesman for the HHDs governing bureau told RFERL Also the presidents spokesman and the foreign minister have publicly clarified that the presidents consent pertains to another kind of commission In Manoyans words Sarkisian believes the wouldbe commission should not determine whether or not a genocide occurred in 191518 and should instead research various details of the genocide In any case our approach is that there was no need to make such statements and create this confusion in the first place he saidManoyan also expressed his partys unease about Sarkisians stated intention to invite Turkish President Abdullah Gul to the firstever game between the national soccer teams of Armenia and Turkey which will be played in Yerevan in early September I think that if the president of Turkey visits Yerevan at least one part of our society will express its attitude he said On July 1 the daily Taregir offered an alternative explanation for Sarkisians affirmation of support for the establishment of a TurkishArmenian commission of historians As is known Moscow has always been jealous about the prospect of a normalization of relations between Yerevan and Ankara says the paper The Kremlin has always managed to torpedo all initiatives aimed reopening the TurkishArmenian border fearing the loss of its influence in ArmeniaHowever there have been suggestions lately that Russian capital which is increasingly establishing itself in Armenia is keen to use our country as a launch pad for occupying the vast Turkish market That is Moscow is not against an open border provided that border is under its control So maybe Sarkisians proposal should be viewed in that context
https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenia_Long_Hot_Political_Summer/1181449.html,Armenias Long Hot Political Summer ,"July 03, 2008 11:22 GMT",With the onset of a traditionally hot summer Armenia remains susceptible to months of political volatility ,With the onset of a traditionally hot summer Armenia remains susceptible to months of political volatility Since the inauguration less than three months ago of Serzh Sarkisian as Armenias third president the confrontation between the new leadership and the opposition led by former President Levon TerPetrossian has shown little sign of abatingThe country faces a simmering political crisis rooted in the mass protests that followed the controversial February 19 presidential election in which official returns showed Sarkisian polling over 52 percent of the vote versus 215 percent for former President Levon TerPetrossian Those protests culminated in a violent clash between opposition demonstrators and riot police on March 12 that left at least 10 people dead and many injuredAfter imposing a state of emergency reinforced by sweeping restrictions on the freedoms of press and assembly outgoing President Robert Kocharian left office burdened by a sudden unpopularity in reaction to what was widely regarded as an unjustifiable overreaction to opposition demonstrationsBut most importantly after eight years of holding the countrys highest post Kocharian bequeathed his successor a dangerous legacy of distrust and discontent Sarkisian has inherited a crisis of confidence that has eroded confidence in the government and faces a further challenge in the form of public demands for change Moreover three crucial new developments have contributed to a political crisis unprecedented in Armenias recent history Series Of TestsSarkisians first impediment is a distinctly new political context insofar as the population has emerged from years of apathy to voice fresh and strident demands for change This means there can be no return to the preelection status quo as the Armenian people have expressed a new sense of impatience and outrageThe most visible affirmation of a public no longer mired in apathy and passivity has been the oppositions success in maintaining its political momentum through rallies and demonstrations On June 20 in the first opposition demonstration following the lifting of the state of emergency TerPetrossian was able to mobilize thousands of supporters in Yerevan That initiative posed a crucial twopart test for the opposition and its leaders It was first and foremost a test of numbers  an indication as to whether the public had the appetite for sustaining the protests into the hot summer It was also a test of resolve pitting the authorities against the opposition as a detachment of riot police initially attempted to deny access to the planned venue before backing down at the last minute in the face of the crowds determination That very public lastminute backdown by police emboldened the demonstrators It also tended to validate the opposition decision to proceed with the unsanctioned rally after the municipal authorities attempt to contain the rally by only granting permission to use a remote sports arenaThat initial success was followed a week later by a demonstration in Gyumri the countrys secondlargest city Several thousand TerPetrossian supporters turned out despite inclement weather The Gyumri city authorities granted official permission and police maintained a respectful distance with no interferenceDespite the limitations of such rallies in achieving concrete political demands they provide the opposition with a mechanism for maintaining momentum and they exert a very public pressure on the government With these goals in mind the opposition is planning another rally on July 4 coinciding with a traditional diplomatic reception at the US Embassy celebrating American independence that is usually attended by much of Armenias political and business elite The second impediment facing Sarkisian stems not from the opposition but from the inherent limits on his own power and authority In other words just as the Armenian people have been reinvigorated by a new sense of dynamic activism the Armenian government finds itself hobbled by an equally new and somewhat overwhelming unpopularity and skepticism This is at least in part rooted in the opaque nature of the Armenian political system where dissent is seen as a direct threat to the state rather than as characteristic of a healthy democracy Within such a closed political system there is no mechanism for expressing political discontent a lack that exacerbates underlying tensions Consequently the crisis is likely to become more acute in the coming monthsThird Sarkisian faces another new rival than just the freshly united opposition Surprisingly while that rival is a former president it is not TerPetrossian but rather Sarkisians outofoffice  but not outof power  predecessor Kocharian who is still exerting influence over the government Kocharian succeeded in implanting within Sarkisians team one of his most loyal henchmen former presidential chief of staff Armen Gevorgian while a second longtime Kocharian associate ProsecutorGeneral Aghvan Hovsepian who has repeatedly argued that the March 1 crackdown was entirely justified remains in his post Kocharian is thus still in a position to wield influence from within to preempt decisions counter to his power or interests Turning A PageKocharians ability to shape the political agenda is likely to prove fleeting insofar as it is based on his personal influence over key parliament deputies and one of the four parties in the coalition government Bargavach Hayastan Prosperous Armenia Such parliamentary power although effective in the short term is unsustainable over the medium term since deputies naturally gravitate to the official center of power It is a political maxim that that power erodes without position over the long term and Kocharian  unlike his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin  does not hold the premiership Sarkisian is growing stronger every day while his predecessors influence is erodingManaging the Kocharian challenge is a more manageable task for the current president The deeper and more fundamental impediments come from the governments more lasting degree of weakness and disabilityMoreover the Armenian government must now learn to govern  not just rule  the country Yet it is disabled by its weakness and undermined by a lack of legitimacy and an absence of any real popular mandate This not only calls into question the authority of the state but also seriously erodes the governments capacity to implement the difficult policies needed to satisfy mounting demands for change and expectations for reform Thus as the political crisis remains far from resolved and likely only to continue the hot Armenian summer of 2008 may usher in a potentially unprecedented autumn of change possibly marking the last page of this chapter of Armenian politicsRichard Giragosian is an independent analyst specializing in international relations economics military security and

key demands addressed to the Armenian authorities by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly PACE in a resolution adopted in midApril,On June 16 the progovernment factions within the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously in favor of setting up an ad hoc commission to investigate the March 12 clashes in Yerevan between supporters of defeated presidential candidate Levon TerPetrossian and security forces that resulted in 10 deaths The conduct of an independent transparent and credible inquiry into the postelection violence was one of the key demands addressed to the Armenian authorities by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly PACE in a resolution adopted in midAprilAt its first session later on June 16 the newly established commission which is due to present its findings to the National Assembly by October 25 elected Samvel Nikoyan Republican Party of Armenia HHK as its chairman The deputychairmans position was reserved for a representative from Zharangutiun Heritage the sole opposition party represented in parliament The commission was initially to include two parliament deputies from each faction and one independent deputy giving a total of at least eight progovernment lawmakers and two opposition representatives But on June 19 it decided to invite to participate in its work all political forces that received more than 3 percent of the popular vote during the May 2007 parliamentary elections but less than the minimum 5 percent needed to win seats in the National Assembly and also defeated candidates in the February 19 presidential elections including TerPetrossian or their representatives  As of the afternoon of 19 June seven invitations had been sent out RFERLs Armenian Service reported In addition to TerPetrossian the other forces invited were the National Accord party of Artashes Geghamian the United Labor Party of Gurgen Arsenian and the Nor Zhamanakner New Times Party of Aram Karapetian Invitations were also sent to former presidential candidates Tigran Karapetian Aram Harutiunian and Vazgen Manukian Geghamian and Manukian have both named representatives who attended a session for the first time on June 24 Noyan Tapan reportedThe Zharangutiun Heritage faction opted out of the June 16 vote on setting up the commission and was not even present at the chamber at the time of voting Zharangutiun faction member Armen Martirosian told RFERL the same day that the faction was unlikely to participate in the commissions work because our basic proposals were not accepted Zharangutiun faction secretary Stepan Safarian similarly told RFERL that there is a preliminary decision to abstain from having any representative in the commission But on June 17 Zharangutiun Chairman Raffi Hovannisian proposed Myasnik Malkhasian and Sasun Mikaelian both of whom are currently being held in pretrial detention on charges of organizing mass unrest and attempting to seize power stemming from their alleged involvement in the March 1 violence RFERLs Armenian Service reported Both men are nominally still members of the HHK parliament faction despite having thrown their support behind TerPetrossian Commission Chairman Nikoyan rejected that proposal as insulting and not serious given that under the commissions statutes factions may only nominate their own members Noyan Tapan reported on June 18  Speaking to RFERLs Armenian Service in prison on June 19 Malkhasian and a second arrested proTerPetrossian parliamentarian Hakob Hakobian both questioned whether the newly formed commission will prove capable of conducting an impartial and objective inquiry in light of the imputed bias of some of its members including Nikoyan who Malkhasian said has made televised statements exonerating the Armenian authorities The commission cannot work independently Malkhasian said There can be no impartial inquiry because no particular investigation is being conducted today in connection with what should be the main focus of the investigation  the people who died There has been no clarification regarding who fired the shots and under what circumstances those people died There should have been an investigation concerning the wounded those who inflicted damage on state property But the investigation today is moving in a different direction They arrest people and after that they try to fabricate charges against them  Hakobian for his part expressed regret that the ad hoc commission chose not to coopt the proposed opposition parliamentarians If the commission wanted to clarify anything they should have been happy to involve Myasnik Malkhasian and Sasun Mikaelian in its work Because both of them were on the ground and did not commit any wrongdoing Hakobian said  The sole nonaligned deputy on the commission Lyova Khachatrian stepped down on June 24 explaining that he did not wish to contribute the widespread negative perception of the commission a perception he feared was reinforced by his own friendship with ProsecutorGeneral Aghvan Hovsepian Noyan Tapan reported on June 25  Also on June 17 the same day that it ruled to establish the ad hoc commission the Armenian parliament adopted by a vote of 80 votes in favor and four against a statement enumerating measures the authorities have taken to fulfill the demands outlined in the PACE April resolution RFERLs Armenian Service reported Those demands included the conduct of an independent inquiry into the March 1 violence the immediate release of opposition supporters detained in the aftermath and the annulment of legal amendments restricting the right to stage public rallies and demonstrations  While up to 70 opposition supporters remain in pretrial detention the parliament voted in the second reading on June 11 to lift those restrictions Two PACE rapporteurs who visited Armenia on June 1617 concluded that the Armenian authorities were dragging their feet in complying with the resolutions requirements But during a vote late on June 25 during its summer session the PACE declined to discipline Armenia for its perceived failure to meet its demands instead granting the Armenian authorities six more months to comply fully with the April resolution RFERLs Armenian Service reported on June 26 One of the two rapporteurs former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott reasoned that two months is not enough time to implement all the changes for which weve called We believe that Armenia is going in the right direction and changes are being made On June 20 between 1000030000 people attended a rally in Yerevan in support of TerPetrossian who interpreted that show of support as evidence that the population at large does not believe the official election results that gave Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian over 52 percent of the vote compared to 215 percent for TerPetrossian It was the first opposition mass rally for which the municipal authorities granted permission since the restrictions imposed by parliament in the wake of the March violence Addressing that rally TerPetrossian again demanded the immediate and unconditional release of those of his supporters still in detention as a precondition for dialogue with the authorities and for the holding of preterm parliamentary and presidential elections in order to restore political stability A followup rally is scheduled for July 4

But Azerbaijani authorities seem unlikely to take note  both the government and the ruling party have dismissed the resolution as biasedIsmayilova says only extreme measures can pressure Baku into cleaning up its act Its pretty difficult given that Azerbaijan has a huge oil wealth that is only going to increase in coming years she says In the past the Azerbaijani government needed international credit international aid like technical assistance programs Now thats no longer needed The only mechanism that the Council of Europe can use to obligate the country to fulfill requirements is threatening the country to cease its membership in the organization But so far this message hasnt been sentLimited Action On ArmeniaAnother country that came under fire in Strasbourg this week was Armenia where police clashed with opposition protesters following the victory of Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian in the February presidential election The clashes the worst civil violence in Armenias postSoviet history left 10 people dead and prompted a state of emergency Speaking on June 25 at a news conference in Strasbourg Council of Europe SecretaryGeneral Terry Davis said the council was keeping a close eye on the probe into the casualtiesPolice in Yerevan are responsible for investigating those deaths and identifying the people who killed other people and charging them bringing them before a court Davis said I keep asking this question I shall continue to ask it and no number of inquiries or investigations or anything of the sort can absolve the police from their responsibility in a democratic societyPACE members this week met for an urgent debate on Armenia after the organizations corapporteurs concluded Armenian authorities had made insufficient progress following the February eventsBut they stopped short of stripping Armenia of its voting rights within the body choosing to postpone the debate until January Harsh Words For Georgian OppositionPACE also had harsh words for Georgia whose President Mikheil Saakashvili lost some of his democratic credentials in November when he sent police to forcibly disperse thousands of opposition protesters and imposed a state of emergencyThe assembly members however concluded that the countrys May 21 parliamentary elections  which handed most seats to Saakashvilis party and its supporters  were mostly in line with international standardsDavid Kakabadze the director of RFERLs Georgian Service believes PACEs assessment was too lenient I think the report was a bit too rosy Even though there were some critical remarks I cannot say that it was critical enough he says Even a member of the Georgian delegation whom I interviewed yesterday said the opposition will be outraged when they read this report because it was definitely quite positive on Georgia But she said that most of the violations that the opposition is citing are not documented well enough to be reflected in this reportThe Georgian opposition also received its share of criticism at this weeks PACE session Terry Davis called on opposition leaders to challenge the government within the limits of democratic discussion debate and argument and played down the oppositions accusations of voting fraudIts not right to assume that because you lose an election theres been cheating on the other side Davis said on June 25 Sometimes you lose an election because the majority of people actually prefer the other candidate and the other parties You have to accept that I think the situation in Georgia has been exaggerated to some extent both inside Georgia and outsideThese strong statements may help change the view that PACE is losing its authority But for now many member states would like to see still tougher action from the Council of Europe Deputy Dmitry Diakov the leader of Moldovas opposition Democratic Party says the country is making little progress in terms of democratic reform despite the presence of the councils Monitoring CommitteeMonitoring helps countries that want to achieve it he says Moldovas entry in the Council of Europe in 1995 marked the beginning of a romantic period that lasted several years and during which we made very good progress Things are different nowadays we have become a problematic country for the Council of Europe a country that doesnt fulfill its obligations fully and on time  a country that promises and fails to deliver Democracy in Moldova is developing but unfortunately it has become very specificThe Council of Europe currently monitors 11 member states Albania Armenia Azerbaijan

https://www.rferl.org/a/1144645.html,Caucasus US Explains Policy On Frozen Conflicts And Closed Borders ,"June 19, 2008 09:31 GMT",,By that Fried was referring to the Caucasus specifically Azerbaijan Armenia and Georgia  three very different states that share similar problems All are struggling to quell internal separatist conflicts to establish independent judicial institutions and modern financial systems and in general to build new identities as sovereign successful nationstatesFried offered his comments to the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs which heard that US foreign policy toward all three countries is to support them as they journey along the same path toward full democracy and marketbased economies that their neighbors to the West have already traveled Fried said no outside power  he mentioned Russia specifically  should be able to extend its sphere of influence over the threeWe do not believe that any outside power should be able to threaten or block the sovereign choice of these nations to join the institutions of Europe and the transAtlantic family if they so choose and if we so choose Fried saidAzerbaijan Bellicose Rhetoric Thanks to its abundance of oil and natural gas Azerbaijan has enjoyed three straight years as the worlds fastestgrowing economy But Fried said the United States remains concerned about a relative lag in democratic reforms including respect for fundamental freedoms such as a free press and the right to assemble He said finding a peaceful resolution of the breakaway region of NagornoKarabakh is one of Azerbaijans biggest challengesThe United States he said supports Azerbaijans territorial integrity but believes the regions final status must be determined through negotiations that take into account international legal and political principles He acknowledged the progress that Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev made when they met in St Petersburg on June 6 but said more must be done and cooler heads must prevailRenewed fighting is not a viable option Fried said We have concerns about occasional bellicose rhetoric from Azerbaijani officials and we have urged the government and will continue to urge the government to focus on a peaceful resolution of this dispute noting the benefits a resolution would bring for all of the CaucusesA few committee members expressed concern at what they said was Azerbaijans intent to go to war with Armenia Congressman Joe Knollenberg Republican Michigan quoted President Aliyev as saying at any moment we must be able to liberate our territories by military means He asked Fried what the United States has done to stop this war machineFried agreed that the bellicose rhetoric that sometimes comes out of Baku is unhelpful and said US diplomats had cautioned Aliyevs government against using warlike language The United States has also raised the issue of Azerbaijans energy exportsWeve also explained to them frankly that Azerbaijans wealth comes from the export of gas and oil and that a war puts that at risk very quickly Fried said It is also the judgment of the United States that Azerbaijan does not have a military superiority over Armenia and that a war would be costly to both sides and unwinnable by either oneRussian Campaign Of Pressure Against GeorgiaAs for Georgia Fried said the Black Sea country faces security challenges Along with Ukraine the country failed to win a Membership Action Plan at the NATO summit in Bucharest this springFried said Georgias desire to join NATO has provoked a campaign of pressure from Russia and listed actions Moscow has taken to punish the Georgian government including the suspension of air and land links and intensifying its relationship with separatist authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions where Russian peacekeeping forces have been deployed since the early 1990s These steps counter Russias own professed policy of supporting Georgias territorial integrity damage Russias role as a facilitator of the UNs mediating process in Abkhazia and risk destabilizing the broader Caucasus region Fried said The United States supports Georgias territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and we hold that Abkhazias status should be determined through a negotiated compromise Weve called on Moscow to reverse its unconstructive actions taken recently and work with us and with others in a diplomatic process to resolve these conflicts On Armenia Fried said geographic isolation widespread corruption and recent setbacks to democratic development have prompted the United States to make supporting Armenias integration into the region a particular priority Solving the NagornoKarabakh conflict would be a major step forward on that integration he said So would normalizing relations between Armenia and Turkey which has imposed a blockade on Armenia since 1993 Fried saidMany members of the committee questioned Fried about what the United States is doing to help end the 15yearold Turkish blockade of Armenia The World Bank estimates that Turkey and Azerbaijans blockades of Armenia reduce Armenias GDP by up to 38 percent annuallyFour US House members recently introduced the End the Turkish Blockade of Armenia bill which calls upon Turkey to end its blockade of ArmeniaFried said the United States supports a normalization of relations as well as the opening of the TurkishArmenian borderReconciliation will require political will on both sides and does require dealing with the sensitive and painful issues including the issue of the mass killings and forced exile of up to 15 million Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire Fried said Turkey needs to come to terms with this history and for its part Armenia should acknowledge the existing border with Turkey and respond constructively to efforts that Turkey may makeArmenian Genocide Debate ResurfacesIn his description of the mass killings of more than a million Armenians by Turkish troops in 1915 Fried avoided the word genocide in line with the Bush administrations policy No US president has ever used that politically charged word to describe the event and the Armenian government and Armenian diaspora have lobbied hard throughout the years to change thatIn October 2007 the House Foreign Relations Committee narrowly passed a resolution to officially describe the massacre as genocide but the legislation was withdrawn when USTurkish relations quickly soured as a resultAt this hearing Representative Diane Watson Democrat California  who represents an area of California that is second only to Moscow in number of ethnic Armenians  pressed Fried on whether the State Department has specifically instructed its officials not to use the term Armenian genocide even though it acknowledges that what happened was a mass targeted killing of an ethnic groupFried said the massacre is a matter of historical record and the United States does not deny what happened but confirmed that US officials do not use the term because to do so would not contribute to a reconciliation between Armenia and Turkey Watson pressed Fried several more times to go on the record and answer yes or no to the question of whether the Bush administration considers what happened to be genocide Fried continued to insist that it does not deny the massacre Finally Watson declared the exchange fruitless and turned off her microphone As the hearing proceeded tensions between Georgia and Russia over Abkhazia were flaring anew drawing a warning from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev not to provoke his countrys troops in the breakaway zoneOn June 17 Georgian officials said they had detained four Russian peacekeepers transporting guided missiles near the western Georgian city of Zugdidi outside the disputed territory Russian officials denied the charge and a Georgian Interior Ministry official said the soldiers would be released because Georgia had no authority over themBut by late on June 18 Georgia had returned only the truck in which the soldiers were traveling In a statement the Kremlin said that Medvedev spoke by telephone with his Georgian counterpart Mikheil Saakashvili telling him the provocations were unacceptable The statement said that Saakashvili promised to sort the situation out and the two leaders agreed on the need to stay in touch with the aim of resolving existing problems and developing bilateral relationsRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias

inauguration as president on April 9 Aliyev refused to meet with Sarkisian on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Bucharest several days earlier RFERLs Armenian Service reported on March 31,It was the first such toplevel meeting since Sarkisians inauguration as president on April 9 Aliyev refused to meet with Sarkisian on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Bucharest several days earlier RFERLs Armenian Service reported on March 31The two presidents agreed on June 6 that their foreign ministers should continue the ongoing talks on ways to resolve the conflict on the basis of the socalled Madrid Proposals presented to the conflict sides in November 2007 by the three cochairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group In an interview with Russias Vesti24 television on June 2 Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian characterized those proposals as a good basis for finding a solution to the conflict In addition the cochairs will travel to Armenia and Azerbaijan at the end of this month for further talks aimed at narrowing the differences between the two sides Both Nalbandian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov described the June 6 talks to journalists as constructive and positive RFERLs Armenian Service reported On June 10 the website kavkazuzelru quoted Mammadyarov as saying that Sarkisians approach differed slightly from that of his predecessor Robert Kocharian in terms of unspecified nuances The two ministers also explained on June 6 that the Madrid Proposals were not discussed during the talks as the approach of both sides requires further evaluation US Minsk Group coChairman and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza made the similar point that the Madrid Proposals are simply proposalsand the two sides do not agree with them completely the website dayaz reported They need to be perfected and both the mediators and the presidents agreed to continue work to that end Bryza continuedThe written text of the Madrid Proposals has not been made public but they are reportedly based on the socalled Basic Principles for resolving the conflict that the cochairmen went public with two years ago These principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around NagornoKarabakh with special modalities for Kelbacar and Lachin districts separating Karabakh from Armenia proper according to the text posted on June 28 2006 on the website of the US Embassy in Yerevan Demilitarization of those territories would follow A referendum or popular vote would be agreed at an unspecified future date to determine the final legal status of NagornoKarabakh An international peacekeeping force would be deployed added the statement A joint commission would be agreed to implement the agreement International financial assistance would be made available for demining reconstruction resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the waraffected regions of NagornoKarabakh The sides would renounce the use or threat of use of force and international and bilateral security guarantees and assurances would be put in placeIn a June 5 interview with the Russian news agency Regnum Bryza said the Minsk Group cochairs see their task as developing an agreement or formula that would allow the two sides here  Armenia and Azerbaijanis  to agree on the status of Karabakh I do not know what their agreement will be All I know is that we need to try to get two sides to get to an agreement on status and thats going to take a long long time Bryza acknowledged the risk involved in insisting that Armenian forces be withdrawn from the seven districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to Karabakh that they currently occupy before a firm agreement is reached on the unrecognized republics future status visavis the Azerbaijan Republic noting that the withdrawal will not happen unless the Armenian side feels it has secured from Azerbaijan a concession of comparable magnitude Similarly Bryza continued on the Azerbaijani side there is a political risk to giving to Armenia what Armenia needs to agree to give back the territoriesAt the same time Bryza stressed that an Armenian withdrawal would improve the security situation in the conflict zone and lessen the potential for a resumption of hostilities such as took place in March of this year He said that there are many elements of this peace plan that are attractive to Armenia including the provision of a land corridor the socalled Lachin corridor connecting Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia Such a land link is one of Armenias three basic requirements from any potential peace plan While Bryza continues to insist that any solution to the Karabakh conflict will require concessions from both sides some Azerbaijani officials clearly believe that Baku is in a stronger position to resist any unpalatable concessions in the wake of the adoption in midMarch by the UN General Assembly of a resolution condemning the continued occupation by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani territoryCommenting on the June 5 St Petersburg talks Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Xazar Ibrahim told journalists in Baku on June 9 that resolution has given rise to a totally new situation He also stressed that discussion of Karabakhs final status should not begin until Armenian forces have withdrawn from all the Azerbaijani territory they currently control and he implied that Baku will insist that the proposed referendum on Karabakhs final status should exclude any variant that would not preserve Azerbaijans territorial integrity and that it might not even grant the disputed region autonomy within Azerbaijan Like Bryza Ibrahim did not mention any time frame for conducting such a referendum but the online daily zerkaloaz on May 28 quoted former Russian Minsk Group Cochairman Vladimir Kazimirov as saying that it should be held no later than five years after the signing of a formal settlement rather than waiting for 1015 yearsMammadyarov on June 10 inferred that Azerbaijans commitment to resolving the conflict peacefully rather than militarily itself constitutes a concession and that the only other concession it would agree to would be to grant NagornoKarabakh any conceivable level of autonomy within Azerbaijan In that context the example he cited was that of Tatarstan within the Russian FederationNalbandian for his part told journalists in Yerevan on June 11 that he considers it imperative that representatives of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh republic participate in the final stage of negotiations on resolving the conflict Noyan Tapan reportedRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by

President Serzh Sarkisian has been hobbled by a daunting set of challenges ranging from internal political tension that shows little sign of dissipating to a looming economic crisis driven by sharp price rises for food and energy that is only expected to worsen in coming months,Since his inauguration less than two months ago Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian has been hobbled by a daunting set of challenges ranging from internal political tension that shows little sign of dissipating to a looming economic crisis driven by sharp price rises for food and energy that is only expected to worsen in coming monthsYet even against this backdrop of internal challenges there have been recent signs suggesting a possible new opportunity for a breakthrough in Armenias strained relationship with its western neighbor Turkey Even before his election as president Sarkisian outlined his vision of how ArmenianTurkish relations could be positively transformed by Turkeys admission to the EU In an article published in December 2006 in The Wall Street Journal and again in an interview with the Financial Times one year later Sarkisian expressed support for Turkeys bid for EU membership albeit for purely pragmatic geopolitical reasons suggesting that EU membership would make Turkey more predictable and thus strengthen Armenias national security  In a positively worded message on February 21 Turkish President Abdullah Gul  one of the first foreign heads of state to congratulate the new president  expressed the hope that Sarkisians election victory will permit the creation of the necessary environment for normalizing relations between the Turkish and Armenian peoples who have proven over centuries they can live together in peace and harmony I sincerely hope thatan atmosphere based on reciprocal trust and cooperation can be established that will contribute to regional peace and prosperity Gul added A subsequent letter from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan last month similarly noted the need for a new dialogue with Armenia  In response the new Armenian prime minister Tigran Sarkisian no relation to the president was quick to reaffirm Armenias desire for a constructive dialogue and the establishment of normal relations without preconditions This was also echoed in a second formal response from Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian who admitted that earlier efforts to bring about an ArmenianTurkish rapprochement failed and called for a fresh approach and new style to be followed by unspecified positive steps Speaking in Brussels on May 28 at a session of the North Atlantic Council Nalbandian again stressed that Armenia sets no preconditions for the normalization of relations with Turkey He further noted that the preamble to the Individual Partnership Action Plan IPAP Armenia signed with NATO in 2005 affirms that Armenia seeks normalization of relations with Turkey and is determined to pursue constructive dialogue including direct talks with Turkey towards this end At one level the exchange of letters and professed readiness to embark on a new dialogue seemingly reflect a renewed sense of optimism especially as Armenia has reiterated that it has no preconditions to any normalization of relations with Turkey Yet such optimism  if indeed it is sincere and not pro forma  could prove misplaced in light of a sobering record of earlier halfhearted diplomatic initiatives and illfated unofficial attempts at forging a common ground between the two countries  Over the past 15 years there has been only minimal contact between Armenia and Turkey That absence of formal relations stems from two main impediments Turkeys support for Azerbaijan in the conflict over NagornoKarabakh and its reaction to attempts by the worldwide Armenian diaspora to obtain broad international recognition of what they call the Armenian genocide of 1915 These two factors have come to dominate Turkish policy regarding its small neighbor resulting in the imposition of an economic blockade in 1993 and a stubborn refusal to even establish formal diplomatic relations  But to date Turkey has gained little from that policy and in fact has actually lost significant diplomatic and economic opportunities Moreover many Turkish officials have privately admitted that Turkish foreign policy regarding Armenia has become far too limited and seemingly hostage to Azerbaijans implacable opposition to any improvement in relations with Armenia  Despite the poor record of past initiatives the potential benefits from even the most basic and rudimentary form of engagement are clear for each country For Turkey opening its closed border with Armenia would constitute a new strategic opportunity for galvanizing economic activity in the impoverished eastern regions of the country which could play a key role in the economic stabilization of the already restive largely Kurdishpopulated eastern regions and thus address a significant national security imperative of countering the root causes of Kurdish terrorism and separatism with economic opportunity  Likewise an open border with Turkey would offer Armenia not only a way to overcome its regional isolation and marginalization but also a bridge to larger markets crucial for economic growth and development In addition the commercial and economic activity resulting from opening the ArmenianTurkish border would foster subsequent trade ties between the two countries that in turn would lead to more formal cooperation in the key areas of customs and border security And with such a deepening of bilateral trade ties and crossborder cooperation the establishment of normal diplomatic relations would undoubtedly follow  Thus the opening of the closed ArmenianTurkish border could not only bring about a crucial breakthrough in fostering trade links and economic relations but may also serve as an impetus to bolster broader stability and security throughout the conflictprone South Caucasus  Yet the divide between potential and reality seems as wide as ever as participants at a oneday conference on ArmenianTurkish relations in Yerevan on May 20 acknowledged Organized by the Yerevanbased Analytical Center on Globalization and Regional Cooperation with the support of the Eurasia Partnership Foundation and the US Agency for International Development the conference brought together several leading Armenian and Turkish experts and analysts for an open discussion of the prospects for a normalization of relations between the two countries and helped to dispel some of the more disturbing stereotypes of Turks that have come to drive Armenian perceptions  As one of the participants later wrote in the May 22 issue of the Turkish Daily News the conference was able to forge a shared recognition of a lack of clarity and a gap between declarations and practice on both sides Highlighting a new sense of optimism Diba Nigar Goksel a senior analyst at the European Stability Initiative and the editor in chief of the Englishlanguage Turkish Policy Quarterly went on to stress that it also seemed hopeful that the sides could move closer to a shared view of history as long as they set reasonable expectations adding that sometimes it takes a trip eastward to appreciate how far Turkey has traveled and the untapped potential it has for more influence  But at the same time the conference seemed to confirm that any breakthrough in ArmenianTurkish relations hinges above all on timing given that in the past each side has on more than one occasion extended a cautious hand to the other but those overtures have never coincided This divergence has also assumed a new political dimension as the new Armenian government is in desperate need of a strategic breakthrough in foreign policy as it struggles to overcome the ongoing internal political crisis  Yet even this imperative for progress from the Armenian side is not enough to overcome the stalemate in relations as the truly revolutionary degree of change now under way within Turkey suggests little likelihood for a breakthrough And while the dynamic process of redefining and reassessing the very tenets of Turkeys national identity and strategic orientation may present a new opportunity for modifying its failed policy toward Armenia Turkey seems wary of alienating its traditional ally Azerbaijan As recently as May 26 the Turkish daily Zaman quoted Economy Minister Mehmet Simsek as saying that the border with Armenia will not be opened until Yerevan solves its problems with Ankara and with Turkeys regional ally Azerbaijan Simsek added that Armenia has more to gain than Turkey from establishing normal relations between the two countries and therefore Armenia should take the first step toward rapprochement  Therefore while it may seem attractive to blame Turkey for failing to seize the initiative and reap the benefits from a fresh approach toward Armenia the real impediment lies in Turkeys desire to allay Azerbaijani concerns at least in the short term

https://www.rferl.org/a/1144553.html,US HumanTrafficking Report Finds Key Criminals Often Go Unpunished ,"June 05, 2008 07:38 GMT",,The report helps determine whether the United States imposes sanctions or other punishments on countries that are seen as not doing enough to fight the practice The report puts countries in one of three levels or tiers that represent how well the United States views such efforts Tier 1 for those doing a good job down to Tier 3 for those doing an unacceptable jobVirtually all of the nations of Eastern Central and Southeastern Europe are in Tier 2 while Russia and Tajikistan are on the socalled watch list of Tier2 countries because they could slip to Tier 3 Uzbekistan is among four countries that have moved up It used to be designated as a Tier3 country and now is on the Tier2 watch list Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are in Tier 2 except for Turkmenistan which is listed as a special case because of the lack of information from the countryGeorgia in classified as Tier 1 while Armenia and Azerbaijan are on Tier2 watch lists Afghanistan is classified as Tier 2Iraq and Kosovo are listed as special cases due to their political transitionsOn May 29 the UN issued a report declaring that the rate of crimes against people and property in the Balkans has improved to the point that the Balkans are considered safer than Western Europe But the State Department report says human trafficking remains a problem in the Balkans particularly in MoldovaMoldova fell to Tier 3 for the first time reflecting its governments failure to tackle traffickingrelated corruption as reflected in the handling of several highprofile cases of complicity by government officials in trafficking said Mark Lagon the State Departments senior adviser on trafficking in persons This failure created a significant impediment to the governments ability to fight trafficking overallMay Lose Financial AssistanceLagon said the State Department hopes the new government in Moldova will root out corrupt officials improve the countrys weak law enforcement and make other efforts to protect victims of human traffickingUntil then Moldova  along with Fiji and Papua New Guinea  may lose some US financial assistance that isnt involved in trade or humanitarian aidIn releasing the report Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice noted that since the United States began issuing the annual reports in 2000 an increasing number of governments around the world have given greater attention the problem of human traffickingToday  because of our efforts the efforts of our allies and reports like the one we are releasing today  there is much greater global awareness about the brutality of human trafficking she said Globally human trafficking is a multidimensional threat It deprives people of their human rights and dignity it increases global health risks it bankrolls the growth of organized crime and it undermines the rule of lawBut Rice said the more governments delve into the problem the more trouble they find Certainly she said traffickers have always found ways to kidnap and transport people for labor and prostitution and theres never been a shortage of victims in regions such as Southeastern Europe India China and the PhilippinesBut Rice said that even in countries where such practices are uncovered the people responsible for this 21stcentury slavery too often go freeFor the first time in this years report we closely examined prosecution data and made a disturbing discovery Rice said Although more countries are addressing sex trafficking through prosecution and convictions the petty tyrants who exploit their laborers rarely receive serious punishment We see this as a serious shortcoming and as we move our efforts forward we and our allies must remember that a robust law enforcement response is essentialNGOs Not Properly TrainedWhats equally disturbing is that nongovernmental organizations NGOs  which frequently offer the first refuge for victims who manage to escape the traffickers  arent trained or otherwise equipped to handle the victimsLagon said that last winter he met two young Romanian women at a shelter in Bucharest for survivors of sex trafficking in Western Europe They finally escaped to the care of an NGO in the West then were repatriated to the Bucharest shelter But Lagon said that once the two women were back in their native country one was eventually found to have an advanced case of tuberculosis and the other was suffering from severe syphilisWhy werent these women given proper medical attention before they were repatriated The time loss made their conditions immensely worse Lagon said Despite increased attention by law enforcement to sex trafficking we are not seeing  as the findings of this report show  significant victim protection and victim services provided This trend has to be reversed or well never be able to help significant numbers of victims become survivors The dehumanized must be restored to their full humanityLagon said the purpose of the report is to diagnose the problem of human trafficking and from year to year to track progress  or lack thereof  in combating it In compiling the report he said hes highlighted five trends in worldwide human trafficking that need special attention by governmentsWeak prosecution of labortrafficking offenses Secondly weak traffickingvictim protection Third forced labor creeping into new growth industries Fourth domestic servitude and luckily problems there are gaining recognition Lagon said And fifth closing a window of vulnerability for migrant workers is an imperativeBut Lagon said the thread that unites these five trends is something even more disturbing  the demand for slave laborers and sex workers

East is edging out the South in the struggle for recognition among the blocs neighbors The initiative has effectively shortcircuited what has come to be known as the borders of Europe debate within the EU Stockholm and Warsaw have forced the major players in the bloc to admit at least tacitly that their eastern neighbors  Belarus Ukraine Moldova Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan  are all located in EuropeAccording to the principles laid out in the EUs own founding document the Rome Treaty they are legally eligible to apply for EU membership should they so wish True in the short term the Eastern Partnership idea may not go beyond tinkering with the practical workings of the existing European Neighborhood Policy ENP currently a catchall for the EUs various neighbors But Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has left little doubt that sooner or later the entire concept of the ENP must change As he told his EU colleagues in Brussels on May 26 the EU has European neighbors in the east whereas to the south there are just neighbors of EuropeMany observers agree that Poland and Sweden are forcing the EU to admit the obvious  that the blocs eastern neighbors cannot forever be denied a shot at EU membership Even Germany and France both skeptical of further enlargement are coming around to the view that it may serve the EUs interests to acknowledge eastern ambitions sooner rather than laterEuropean Identity AspirationsMichael Emerson a senior analyst with the Brusselsbased Center for European Policy Studies says Sikorski is essentially stating the obviousFundamentally it is uncontroversial that the eastern neighbors  which are all members of the Council of Europe  have a certain European identity and aspirations and perspectives possibly for some of them Emerson says Whereas that is not the case for the Mediterranean Arab statesObvious it may be but so far the continental old member states  afflicted as they are by enlargement fatigue  have been loath to admit thisStill this is changing FrankWalter Steinmeier foreign minister of the EUs largest member state Germany spoke of the Eastern Partnership with approval on May 26 He said the EU has every interest in stabilizing Eastern Europe He added however that that does not necessarily mean preparing its countries for accessionFrench Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said after the meeting that it is no sin to go east and south at the same time France has so far championed the EUs southern neighbors securing for them twothirds of the 12 billion euros earmarked for the ENP between 200713 ENP participants include Algeria Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Egypt Georgia Israel Jordan Lebanon Libya Moldova Morocco the Occupied Palestinian Territory Syria Tunisia and Ukraine Frances role is all the more significant as it will hold the next EU Presidency between July and DecemberMajor Gesture Toward UkraineThere are suggestions that France is trying to placate eastern member states in order to win support for its own Mediterranean Union for the southern neighbors endorsed by EU leaders in March But there are signs Paris may have more noble motives Diplomats in Brussels say France is preparing a major gesture during its presidency toward Ukraine which has long claimed it is more than a mere neighborDuring the French presidency we will be very open especially for Ukraine because we would like to get out of this negative position the EU had in the past says Michel Foucher a former senior French diplomat and currently a member of the Robert Schuman Foundation a French think tank And we think its important to have a kind of opendoor policy toward Ukraine which is not to make decisions not prescribe solutions but not to exclude anything if I may say soUkraine which is presently negotiating a new partnership accord with the EU wants an Association Agreement All new Eastern European member states had Association Agreements with the EU before they were given candidate statusFoucher said an Association Agreement is one option adding that Paris at this stage is leaning toward the formulation privileged partnership This would evoke uneasy echoes of Turkeys travails which is being offered just such a designation as an alternative to full EU membershipBut according to Foucher the idea that eastern neighbors are European and therefore theoretically eligible for EU membership is uncontroversial in Paris The problem he says  mentioning Belarus Armenia and Azerbaijan by name  is the timing and internal political situation of some of the countries Attitudes Toward East ChangingGerman analysts also bear out the impression that attitudes toward the East are changing on the continentJoerg Himmelreich a senior transAtlantic fellow at the German Marshall Foundation says Berlin sees no problem in the idea that Ukraine Belarus Moldova and the South Caucasus belong to Europe He says Germany has acted with caution however for fear of upsetting FranceSo far it was always concern for France which caused Germany to hesitate to pursue a more active integration and accession policy toward the eastern European neighborhood Himmelreich says And it is right therefore that now the Polish foreign minister is taking up this objectiveHimmelreich suggests the PolishSwedish initiative  spearheaded by Sikorski and his Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt  may be viewed as serving as a proxy for Germanys own longterm interests which Berlin is presently unable to act on Himmelreich says the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats in the current German governing coalition are blocking all of each others foreignpolicy initiatives The situation is likely to remain at an impasse until the next federal parliamentary elections in December 2009 Himmelreich says Foreign Minister Steinmeiers Ostpolitik is fadingJan Techau head of the Alfred von OppenheimCenter for European Studies in Germany notes the Eastern Partnership initiative addresses a plan left over from Germanys EU presidency in the first half of 2007 At the time Germany spearheaded the launch of a Black Sea Synergy initiative designed to engage the eastern neighbors as well as Russia and Turkey The idea however has stalledBoth Techau and Himmelreich suggest Germany will at some point overcome its present preoccupation with Russia  which vies for primacy in the postSoviet space  and become more assertive in pursuing its own interests in the East Himmelreich predicts this will be accompanied by a more active German stance in GeorgiaLarger RealignmentIt seems hardly a coincidence that the Eastern Partnership initiative was unveiled on May 26 the same day EU foreign ministers approved strategic partnership talks with Russia The PolishSwedish proposal appears to be part of a larger realignment of the EUs Ostpolitik which could lead to a more active stance in the future This seems to involve encouragement by Berlin and Paris for a leading role for Poland among the new member states even if under some notional Swedish tutelagePolands first test was the normalization of relations with Russia It dropped its 18month veto on the EURussia talks and negotiated an end to a subsequent Lithuanian veto In return Poland is being conspicuously consulted by France and Germany when it comes to contacts with Russia After a fourday tour of Russia in midMay Germanys Steinmeier met Sikorski for a friendly lunch on May 25 And French President Nicolas Sarkozy was in Poland on May 28 just one day before a visit to Paris by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin

to reinforce the blocs ties with its eastern neighbors  with a view to putting at least some of them on the path to EU membership,The initiative unveiled at an EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels seeks to reinforce the blocs ties with its eastern neighbors  with a view to putting at least some of them on the path to EU membershipIt also reflects growing concerns among the EUs newer member states that the bloc is neglecting its eastern neighborsSpeaking ahead of the EU foreign ministers meeting at the European Policy Center on May 26 Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said closer ties with countries like Ukraine and Moldova are hampered by what he called enlargement fatigue within the EUThe EUs current European Neighborhood Policy ENP makes no distinction between the blocs eastern and southern neighbors ENP participants include Algeria Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Egypt Georgia Israel Jordan Lebanon Libya Moldova Morocco the Occupied Palestinian Territory Syria Tunisia and Ukraine Crucially the ENP is designed to remain noncommittal about countries future membership prospectsThis is a circumstance Poland wants to change Sikorski said Warsaw and Stockholm are looking for an ideological enhancement of the ENPWe in Poland make a distinction between the southern dimension and the eastern dimension of the ENP and it consists in this  to the south we have neighbors of Europe to the east we have European neighbors Sikorski said He said that this constitutes a big difference These are countries  Belarus Ukraine Moldova  whose entire territories lie in Europe and by the provisions of the EUs founding Treaty of Rome they all have the right one day to apply to fulfill the criteria for EU membership and perhaps to become membersMeanwhile the EUs southern member states have secured twothirds of the 12 billion euros 189 billion available to the ENP between 200713 for North African countries  although they have already been deemed ineligible for EU membership France is spearheading efforts to set up a Mediterranean Union to coordinate EU cooperation with the southern neighborsSikorski said the Eastern Partnership would be one of the main priorities of the EUs Polish presidency in 2011 But the initiative is likely to kick off even soonerCzech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra told journalists as he arrived at the Brussels meeting that the Czech EU presidency in 2009 will also work to balance the EUs eastern and southern dimensionsWe support this PolishSwedish initiative very much Vondra said It goes in the same direction that we want And we see that the next year we need to balance This year it is a Mediterranean year So the next year would be the eastern yearGrand Bargain Within EUDiplomats say the EUs larger member states  who often oppose the smaller new states over issues related to the former Soviet space  are supportive of the Eastern Partnership initiative France which will take over as the next EU presidency in July is motivated by the need to build support for its Mediterranean strategy among the eastern member states Germany traditionally takes a close interest in the EUs eastern policy while Britain is traditionally one of the staunchest supporters of continued enlargementIt also appears the PolishSwedish initiative is part of a grand bargain within the EU that has seen Lithuania formally drop its objections to an EURussia strategic partnership deal EU foreign ministers have agreed that the longdelayed talks with Russia can begin at the EURussia summit at KhantyMansiisk on June 2627Significantly Poland and Sweden led the EU mediating effort earlier this month when Lithuania first stepped in to veto the talks Vilniuss concerns  ranging from trade complaints the status of criminal investigations and Russias recent aggressive moves in Georgia  are now to be addressed in the course of the EURussia negotiationsThe PolishSwedish initiative is unlikely to bring with it an immediate sea change in the EUs eastern policy Reflecting the weight of the consensus within the bloc the EUs external relations commissioner Benita FerreroWaldner said on May 26 that she does not think it is a good idea to introduce distinctions between the eastern and southern neighborsInstead FerreroWaldner said the Eastern Partnership initiative would need to show it can add value to the existing Neighborhood Policy In Eastern Europe indeed there are some issues which can suitably be addressed at a regional level  for instance on energy transport networks maybe cooperation on trafficking cooperation against illegal immigration she saidFerreroWaldner appeared particularly concerned the new plan could interfere with the EUs Black Sea Synergy scheme announced last year  which also involves Russia and TurkeyPolands Sikorski also stressed the importance of practical cooperation but in a subtly different sense He said Ukraine Moldova and eventually Belarus would be welladvised to follow the example of the Visegrad group which was set up by Poland the Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary to pursue regional cooperation before those countries were granted entry into the EU Sikorski noted that while eastern membership hopefuls cannot change the rules of accession they can change the perceptions in the EU if they demonstrate an ability to work together and reform This in turn could stand them in good stead when the EU catches its breath and recovers from the current enlargement fatigueEU Expands EastwardTo view RFERLs archive of coverage related to EU expansion click here

position of foreign minister Seyran Ohanian the former chief of Armenias armed forces has become the defense minister The third new face has been known for more than a week with the appointment of former Central Bank chief Tigran Sarkisian to the post of prime ministerThree ministers retained the positions they held in the outgoing government Gevorg Danielian Republican Party will stay on as justice minister while Armen Grigorian Prosperous Armenia will continue as minister of sport and youth affairs and David Lokian Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun as agriculture ministerConsultations ContinuingThe ruling coalition  led by President Serzh Sarkisians Republican Party and including Prosperous Armenia Orinats Yerkir and Dashnaktsutiun  is continuing consultations and a full cabinet is expected to be formed by the end of this weekThe new government will have its work cut out for it in winning over a population still recovering from the bloodiest postelection violence Armenia has ever seen After weeks of protests contesting the results of the countrys February 19 presidential election police on March 1 moved in with force to drive opposition supporters from the capitals Freedom Square Dominated by backers of secondplace finisher Levon TerPetrossian the rallies were staged daily to voice the belief that the election was rigged and to call for a new voteTen people  including protesters and two police officers  were killed as a result of the chaos that followed the police action Armenian authorities followed up by imposing a 20day state of emergency making mass arrests introducing a ban on public demonstrations and curtailing media freedomsAs a result of those steps the new government also faces an uphill climb in restoring its image in the international communityThe Monitoring Commission of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE adopted a resolution on April 17 urging the Armenian authorities to implement a number of reforms aimed at improving the situation in the country PACE suggests launching an independent inquiry into the clashes releasing all prisoners who did not commit crimes amending the law on public rallies and engaging in a dialogue with the oppositionPACE warns that unless those conditions are met it will consider suspending the voting rights of Armenia during its next session which takes place in JuneAttempts To Increase LegitimacyAlexander Iskandarian the director of the Yerevanbased Caucasus Media Institute says the Armenian authorities are well aware of the need to improve their imageEverything that the authorities are doing now represents their attempt to increase legitimacy Iskandarian says Be it through appointments of some neutral figures through attempts to talk to the public and assure them that steps will be made to improve the situation through appropriation of the oppositions slogans through the removal of figures from the government who particularly irritate people and so on These are attempts to increase legitimacy  attempts to make people trust the government and president more The authorities are lacking this right now Whether they will be successful in their attempts remains to be seenMost observers do not expect significant changes in the countrys foreign or domestic policiesNew Foreign Minister Nalbandian is a 52yearold career diplomat who apart from France has also served as the countrys ambassador to Israel Andorra and the Vatican He replaces Vartan Oskanian a veteran diplomat who announced his resignation last week At this moment it is difficult to predict what the next president will do Oskanian told RFERLs Armenian Service after his resignation Its his choice what kind of foreign policy he will implement  whether he will maintain the notion of complementarity between Russia and the West or not But given my experience I dont think Armenias room to maneuver is very wide Our options are limited What can be done is simply to make some changes in accents not necessarily in directionNew Defense Minister Ohanian who is 46 is a close associate of the new president Serzh Sarkisian Both men hail from NagornoKarabakh and have a longstanding friendship Seyran Ohanian has a somewhat standard background for Armenian highranking officials says Iskandarian Just like nearly the entire political and moreover military elite of Armenia his roots are in the Karabakh war He is a veteran of the war and has firsthand military experience After that he worked at various posts at the Defense MinistryThe new administrations attitude on the issue of NagornoKarabakh  an Armeniancontrolled and populated enclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war in 198894  has perhaps gained the most clarity In his first major foreignpolicy speech on April 16 Armenias president was uncompromising Azerbaijan must understand the simple reality that the existence of the republic of NagornoKarabakhs independence is irreversible Sarkisian said The people of NagornoKarabakh have won their right to a free and independent life And through our efforts that right must be recognized by the international community

respect the human rights and freedoms of citizens to guarantee the independence territorial integrity and security of the republic  in glory of the Republic of Armenia and for the prosperity of the people of the Republic of ArmeniaThe former prime minister made the pledges before a special parliamentary session held near the scene of largescale protests that followed his February election victory His inauguration took place inside the Yerevan Opera House which stands adjacent to the square where the monthlong protests came to a violent conclusion 40 days agoIn the course of the ceremony the new president also addressed the controversy surrounding his election promising to reconcile with his opponents This ceremony takes place about a month after painful events which inflicted wounds that are still fresh he said Today I urge everybody to look forward together to seek and find the way for reconciliation development and future of ArmeniaEight People KilledOn March 1 police moved in to break up rallies staged on Freedom Square by opposition supporters who believed Sarkisians victory was rigged Eight people including one police officer died in the violent clashes that ensued leading the authorities to impose a 20day state of emergency As the April 9 inauguration ceremonies were taking place hundreds of supporters of the man who finished second to Sarkisian in the February 19 poll Levon TerPetrossian gathered in the capital to lay flowers in memory of those killed Police forces watched from afar but some arguments between protesters and police forces were reportedAram Abramian political analyst and the editor in chief of the Armenian newspaper Aravot says the opposition harbors significant animosity over the violenceThere is an active group among the youth especially who attended TerPetrossians rallies for 10 days in a row after the elections  well they are still significantly electrified Abramian says But I would not say that the whole society lives only with this memory The society is preoccupied with its everyday concernsSarkisians ascent to the presidency led to widespread speculation that his predecessor Robert Kocharian might take over Sarkisians post as prime minister The two men are leaders of the socalled Karabakh clan which critics claim is given preferential treatment within government circles Both Sarkisian and Kocharian are from NagornoKarabakh the Armeniancontrolled and populated exclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war from 198894 But Sarkisians position as prime minister is now expected to be filled by Armenias Central Bank chief 48yearold Tigran Sarkisian who is of no relation to the new president Not Another KarabakhianOn April 8 Tigran Sarkisians candidacy for the vacant post was backed by the countrys ruling coalition led by the new presidents Republican PartyAccording to Abramian the appointment of Tigran Sarkisian  who is not from NagornoKarabakh  could serve to distance the new president from allegations that he will pad his administration with officials from the regionI think this factor  that Tigran Sarkisian is not from Karabakh  did influence Serzh Sarkisians choice Abramian says However in reality this is not the most important aspect Whats important is the policies that he will implement But the fact that on a daytoday level people will not say Look another Karabakhian was appointed  perhaps this really mattersSerzh Sarkisians fledgling presidency faces a stern test in repairing the Armenian governments image both at home and abroad Delegations from 58 countries and 12 international organizations reportedly took part in the ceremonies but criticism over the violence that marred the postelection rallies continues to lingerWestern governments have stopped short of targeting Kocharian and Sarkisian specifically saying that both the ruling authorities and TerPetrossian had a hand in the violence But watchdog organizations have been less forgiving of the governments actions In the runup to Sarkisians inauguration the New Yorkbased Human Rights Watch and the Brusselsbased International Crisis Group released reports reiterating their condemnation of the violence as well as recently passed restrictions on public demonstrations Dramatic Steps NeededUS Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza said in an interview with RFERLs Armenian Service on April 9 that dramatic steps are needed to restore a sense of confidence that the country is moving in the right directionWhat happened on March 1 is unprecedented in the latest and of course permanent phase of an independent Armenia  or in the South Caucasus he said After an election despite all of the turbulence in Georgia and Azerbaijan and Armenia over the course of the last 18 years or 17 years something like this has never happened with people being killed  at least eight people killedBryza said liberties such as freedom of the media and assembly should be restored with the understanding that all such freedoms are a twoway street He also called on the authorities to release opposition figures who were arrested before and during the state of emergency that was declared after the violenceThe European Union has kept a low profile on Armenia since the blocs Slovenian presidency issued a statement on March 12 demanding an independent inquiry into the violence and asking all political parties to engage in dialogue However one EU diplomat told RFERL on condition of anonymity that the fact that EU foreignpolicy chief Javier Solana put off sending a

https://www.rferl.org/a/1079627.html,Armenia Key US Diplomat Calls For Roundtable In Wake Of Clashes ,"March 12, 2008 16:13 GMT",,RFERL Despite your calls on the Armenian government to stop arresting opposition activists theyre still being arrested What can be done about itMatthew Bryza Its ultimately a problem that has to be repaired by the government of Armenia of course and we call on the government of Armenia to cease arrests of political leaders and to restore the democratic momentum that was what had characterized Armenias political development until the period just after this last election So its really up to the government of Armenia to take steps to restore this democratic momentum So one way besides ceasing these arrests is to restore media freedom and then to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible and then finally launch a nationwide roundtable  and by nationwide I mean including all major political parties  to chart the course forward to strengthen Armenias democracyRFERL As many independent journalists have reported opposition leader Levon TerPetrossian is technically under house arrest There are indications that the government might arrest him formally For example today Armenian Minister of Justice Gevorg Danielian told the French news agency AFP that there is enough evidence to press criminal charges against him Meanwhile Armenias general prosecutor said in his statement on March 7 that TerPetrossian hypnotized the people and used psychological sabotage all kinds of psychological tricks mechanisms of deception What is your reaction Bryza Wow thats quite a statement My reaction is that regarding Mr TerPetrossian  its disputed whether hes under house arrest if you talk to the government of Armenia If you talk to him he probably says hes under house arrest I went to visit him at his house and found it a useful conversation in which I encouraged him to participate fully in dialogue with the government of Armenia to do what I mentioned before to chart a way forward to restore democratic momentum in Armenian society There is much criticism People have been sending criticism in both directions  both toward the opposition and Mr TerPetrossian and the government  in terms of what happened on March 1 with the violent demonstrations Mr TerPetrossian is obviously a very wellknown politician who is very skillful in his oration so he does have the ability to inspire people and he was doing so through his repeated appearances at the demonstrations in Theater Square in Yerevan So thats what he was doing He was being a politician And in the aftermath of what happened on March 1 as I said there were a lot of allegations that both the government and the opposition sides were using violence Now no one accuses Mr TerPetrossian himself of using violence but there were people in the crowd who did use violence and in many cases perhaps they would say provoked But in any case this wasnt an instance of a particular leader having magical powers Mr TerPetrossian was being a politicianRFERL Armenian authorities say security forces used no firearms when they dispersed the demonstration on March 1 The opposition says Special Forces fired indiscriminately on demonstrators and that there are more casualties than the government has reported There was a suggestion by the EU presidency to conduct an independent investigation Do you support the ideaBryza We support the idea of an independent investigation and its useful But that said I think itll be very difficult ever to assess exactly how the tragically violent events transpired Now what we need to do is move forward to repair the damage of the election by prosecuting people who used violence unlawfully or who were violating election law So that is looking back a little bit but we need to get beyond the backwardlooking and move forward We urge Mr TerPetrossian to participate constructively in a dialogue with all the political leaders including the government of Armenia and find a way to repair the damage done by the election and also chart a way to strengthen Armenias democratic institutionsRFERL There are only a few countries that block citizens access to the Internet and now Armenia is one of them The media in Armenia is in fact not operational today No opposition or independent newspapers can be published only progovernment media RFERL has also been prevented from broadcasting Despite your requests the Armenian government has shown no intention of lifting the media restrictions In your interview with the Associated Press you said It seems clear that the reaction by the government was harsh and brutal Do you think it is time for President George W Bush to get involved in solving Armenias crisisBryza I think we have a very useful and effective means of communication with the leadership of Armenia and the opposition I also think its essential as does my governmentthat these media freedoms be restored And I also have a feeling that in the government of Armenia people are thinking through how to do that and so we can only urge them to restore those media freedoms as quickly as possible Brutality occurred on both sides and I also tried to make that clear in fact Ive tried to make that clear in all of my interviews The problem is that once people get into a confrontational situation in the street and if there is not a free flow of information through an independent media each side tends to demonize the other And its much more difficult to bring back under control the emotions that are stoked when government and opposition people are confronting each other in the street So the brutality refers to what happened overall Ultimately of course governments have responsibility for the use of government force against civilians Civilians have a responsibility as well to protest peacefully and to use mechanisms within the rule of law to express themselves So thats what we call on everybody to do and again we underscore that to keep tension at the lowest possible level its important that there be free media so that all sorts of unfounded rumors dont percolate through society and raise tensions even higherRFERL And what about President Bushs possible involvementBryza As I said we have very effective channels of communication right now were communicating at many levels so Im comfortable that the way were communicating now with the government is satisfactory President Bush will make his own decision and if he wishes to become involved thats of course his decision Hes the head of our government he is the ultimate determiner of our foreign policy and its up to him to decide when to get involved in any issueRFERL As you mentioned earlier the United States is urging Armenians to start a dialogue and a roundtable was suggested as a possible format of talks between the government and the opposition Could you be more specificBryza We would like to see representatives of all the largest political parties  opposition progovernment coalition members  wed very much like to see them all coming together for a discussion representing all the voters of Armenia for talks about the future of Armenias democratic institutions and talks about how to strengthen those institutions What the specific topics would be is up to the participants of course but the process of them resolving their countrys political future through discussions at the bargaining table rather than in the streets is the way to build a healthy democracyRFERL What is Russias role in this political crisis Are you also talking with Moscow about the events in Armenia Will Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raise the issue in her meetings with Russian officials when she visits Moscow later this monthBryza We talk to our colleagues in the Russian government and Russian diplomatic circles about many issues that have to do with the Caucasus We remain in constant contact about developments in Armenia as well as in Azerbaijan so of course were in general contact Were not coordinating however our overall diplomatic responses in terms of what step we think needs to be taken next The United States has a clear vision of what developing a genuine democracy means and were pursuing that objective on our own but in close collaboration with the private citizens and the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1079586.html,Armenia Crisis Spotlights Karabakh Clan ,"March 05, 2008 14:01 GMT",,Today as an opposition leader TerPetrossian is the most outspoken critic of what he and his allies call the Karabakh clan lambasting his former proteges for raiding the countrys treasury strangling the economy and stifling democracyThe main targets of the broadside have been outgoing President Robert Kocharian and his preferred successor Serzh Sarkisian the current prime minister who defeated TerPetrossian in Armenias February 19 presidential election Both Kocharian and Sarkisian hail from NagornoKarabakh an Armeniancontrolled and populated enclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war in 198894Speaking on the campaign trail in February TerPetrossian accused Kocharian and Sarkisian of bringing their Karabakh allies to Armenia and handing them the crown jewels of the economyBecause of these two persons 15000 people have moved from Karabakh to Armenia mainly Yerevan in the past 10 years TerPetrossian said Each of them has been given a position As if that wasnt enough now the business sphere is also being given to themSarkisians pat response to the criticism has been to say Yes I am Karabakhian but I am Armenian firstArmenias controversial election has led to allegations of fraud government resignations violent street protests a deadly police crackdown and a state of emergency It has also exposed a deep rift in society between those born in Armenia proper and those from NagornoKarabakh who have resettled in the country Critics allege that Karabakh Armenians have benefited from government favoritism and that Kocharian and Sarkisian have dragged their feet on formally ending the conflict to advance their cronies business interestsYerevanbased political analyst Stepan Grigorian who is sympathetic to TerPetrossian and the opposition says having a president from NagornoKarabakh who governs Armenia very badly has fueled resentmentCertain negative feelings exist Grigorian says They do not extend to ordinary people of Karabakh but refer to those people who came to Armenia from there Robert Kocharian brought many people with him and appointed them to high positions This created more caution So yes certain tension exists of courseThe Karabakh OligarchsArmenia had control of Karabakh when a ceasefire was reached in 1994 But the victory came with a price as Armenias borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have remained sealedTerPetrossian who became Armenias first postindependence president in 1991 brought Sarkisian  who was a senior military official in NagornoKarabakh  to Yerevan in 1993 to serve as defense minister In 1998 he named Kocharian who served as chairman of NagornoKarabakhs State Defense Committee and later as president Armenias prime ministerIt was a decision TerPetrossian soon regretted He proposed a compromise solution to Azerbaijan on NagornoKarabakh that Kocharian staunchly opposed TerPetrossian was forced to resign over the issue in February 1998 and Kocharian won a special election to succeed him Under Kocharian Sarkisian served in a number of posts including defense minister interior minister nationalsecurity minister presidential chief of staff and most recently prime ministerAram Abramian editor in chief of the Yerevanbased daily newspaper Aravot and who has roots in NagornoKarabakh says Kocharian and Sarkisian brought in associates from the territory who took over state posts and dominated the business eliteThere are 20 30 families  oligarchs  people who thanks to the opportunities that are provided to them by the authorities became rich and have wide possibilities of avoiding taxes and custom fees Abramian says adding that wellconnected moguls were able to gain monopolies over fuel sugar and other commodities Others who are less powerful do not have this right Abramian adds Not all of these people are from Karabakh It does not matter where they come from  the most important thing is for them to serve the authoritiesAmong those identified by analysts as part of the Karabakh clan are Kocharians son Sedrak who reportedly controls mobilephone imports Barsegh Beglarian who dominates the gasstation market Mika Bagdasarov who controls oil imports and heads the national airline and Karen Karapetian head of the Armrusgazard gas company a joint venture with Russias GazpromClosed BordersAbramian and other analysts say these oligarchs benefit from the lack of a final resolution to the Karabakh conflict and the closed borders with Turkey and AzerbaijanThis is one of the reasons why these issues are not being solved because to have open borders with Europe Asia and so on  in that case the flows of goods in either direction will be wider and it will be more difficult to control them Abramian says Now however when one narrow flow comes through Georgia and another even narrower comes via Iran controlling these flows of goods is much easierObservers say such arrangements also stifle local production hinder small business development and ultimately harm the countrys economy And that is a major reason why one of TerPetrossians main bases of support is among small and midlevel entrepreneursThis kind of economy  when the highranking officials are importing goods  leads to these same officials not being interested in promoting local production Grigorian says And because of this it is in very difficult shape now So during the elections midsize and big business wholly supported TerPetrossianThere are slight cultural differences between nativeborn Armenians and those from NagornoKarabakh according to analysts Abramian says Karabakhians are more favorably oriented toward Russia are more likely to speak the Russian language and are less religious than Armenians for exampleHe adds however that it is the dominance of Kocharian and Sarkisians allies that has fueled resentment against people from NagornoKarabakh few of whom have benefited from the largesseArmenian people our compatriots who live in Karabakh  or like me have roots there  have nothing to do with this Abramian says They are Armenians just like everybody else However two people who have kept power throughout a decade  and plan to do so for many more decades  they indeed provoked certain negative attitude within the Armenian population For it was not only them but their relatives acquaintances  tens hundreds of them  arrived here and occupied highranking positions and had successful business careers This triggers a natural reactionRFERL

Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian who according to official results won the February 19 presidential election with almost 53 percent of the vote appealed to his defeated rival candidates and their supporters to cooperate and possibly form a coalition government but TerPetrossian responded just hours later by demanding that Sarkisian and outgoing President Robert Kocharian resign Claiming that he received 65 percent of the vote rather than the 2151 percent confirmed as the final tally by the Central Election Commission on February 24 TerPetrossian has told supporters that he will leave Freedom Square where his supporters have assembled daily since February 20 only to move into the presidential palace    TerPetrossians rejection of the ballot as less than free and fair is not entirely unfounded nor is the anger and resentment of many of the tens of thousands of Armenians who support him  The election monitoring mission organized by the OSCE and the Council of Europe registered the lack of a level playing field during the election campaign in particular Sarkisians use of the administrative resources available to him as prime minister and the equally blatant bias shown by progovernment media against TerPetrossian  The actual vote too was marred by isolated instances of violence intimidation and procedural violations such as ballot stuffing while the vote count and tabulation was assessed as bad or very bad in 16 percent of polling stations where international observers were present The comparable figure for the preterm Georgian presidential ballot was 25 percent and for the 2003 presidential election in Azerbaijan more than 50 percent  On February 25 the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD whose presidential candidate Vahan Hovannisian placed fourth with 6 percent of the vote issued a statement implying that TerPetrossians supporters too resorted to vote buying and other irregularities TerPetrossians supporters allege that the turnout figure of 17 million or almost 70 percent of registered voters was inflated and that only some 11 million voters cast ballots But it remains an open question whether as TerPetrossians supporters claim the violations were of a magnitude to reduce Sarkisians share of the vote to below the 50 percent plus one vote required to avoid a runoff  The mass popular support for TerPetrossian reflects not simply a rejection of an election outcome perceived to have been manipulated thereby negating voters legitimate choice At another level it is a protest against the widespread official corruption embezzlement and mismanagement that TerPetrossisan lambasted repeatedly in his campaign speeches Speaking at a press conference on February 26 leading HHD member Armen Rustamian stressed that the Armenian leadership should be asking themselves the pertinent question What have we done wrong that so many people have aligned with Levon TerPetrossian Finally it is an expression of confidence in a man who spearheaded the drive for Armenias independence and who while he undoubtedly failed during his six years as president to curtail similar corruption among his own entourage is widely regarded as personally honest To that extent it reflects the degree to which politics in Armenia is dominated not by political parties or by issues but by individual politicians  Despite the procedural violations registered during the voting and vote count by international monitors the international community has accepted the election outcome as valid Several heads of state have congratulated Sarkisian personally although the US State Department congratulated the Armenian people on holding an active and competitive ballot Both the US State Department and Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis in his capacity as president of the Council of Europes Committee of Ministers and visiting Finnish Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairman in Office Ilkka Kanerva have praised the Armenian authorities restraint in the face of the ongoing mass protests and stressed the need for the two opposing sides to resolve their differences within the framework of the constitution  In light of statements by the international community endorsing the official results of the ballot the Armenian leadership has every incentive to avoid any escalation that could end in bloodshed And TerPetrossian and his supporters risk forfeiting any international support they may be counting on if they embark in their demands for new elections on any action that could be construed by the authorities as an attempt to seize power Outgoing President Robert Kocharian ordered senior military National Security Service and Interior Ministry personnel on February 23 to take measures to avert any such unconstitutional moves Meanwhile a February 23 offer by defeated HHD candidate Hovannisian to mediate between the two sides has gone unregarded  TerPetrossian is almost certainly waiting for the Constitutional Court to respond to his formal appeal to invalidate the outcome of the February 19 vote and schedule new elections The court must do so within 10 days of the appeal which was made on February 25 He may also be hoping that more senior government officials will defect and join his camp as some 10 Foreign Ministry personnel and two department heads from the Trade and Economic Development Ministry have already done But the scale of those defections cannot be compared with the massive withdrawal of support especially by 40 of the 96 deputies from the majority Hanrapetutiun parliament faction that apparently proved decisive in impelling TerPetrossian to step down as president 10 years ago TerPetrossian claimed on February 27 that thousands of civil servants and some members of the presidential administration are on his side RFERLs Armenian Service reportedEven if TerPetrossian did not plan from the outset to use in order to seize power the tactical and logistical skills in inspiring and mobilizing tens of thousands of people that he acquired 20 years ago as leader of the Karabakh Committee his ignoring of Hovannisians offer to mediate and his implicit rejection of Sarkisians offer of cooperation only serve to substantiate Kocharians allegations that this is his ultimate intention As his rhetoric becomes bolder and popular support for him shows no sign of abating the options available to both sides for avoiding a violent confrontation are diminishing with each passing day

https://www.rferl.org/a/1079532.html,Armenia Opposition Protests Continue Over Presidential Election Results ,"February 25, 2008 14:17 GMT",,They are loudly voicing their belief that former President Levon TerPetrossian who finished second in the February 19 poll lost only because the election was rigged  TerPetrossian has vowed to file a complaint with the Constitutional Court and is demanding that a new vote be held  The protests have gained momentum in recent days with several government officials coming out in support of the opposition Many of them including nine highranking Foreign Ministry officials have reportedly resigned  In the last few days several key opposition activists were arrested in separate incidents Among those arrested were the leader of one political party and a former deputy prosecutorgeneral  Fears were raised that the authorities might resort to force to break up the peaceful protest after outgoing President Robert Kocharian held a meeting on February 23 with top military and security officials He described the opposition protests as an attempt to seize power by illegal means and said that law and order was to be enforced  His instructions were followed up with the detention of the opposition figures on February 2324 and with the deployment of a large police presence in central Yerevan on February 24  On February 23 police detained former Deputy ProsecutorGeneral Gagik Jahangirian who had resigned in protest a day earlier Gunfire was reportedly exchanged after officers stopped the vehicle in which Jahangirian was traveling and authorities said a search of the vehicle uncovered four pistols and a hunting rifle  The next day police detained Aram Karapetian leader of the opposition party New Times and politician Sambat Ayvazian a former tax chief  Armenian officials said both Ayvazian and Karapetian were detained for possessing illegal weapons The New Times offices were subsequently searched and computers confiscated according to RFERLs Armenian Service  RFERLs Armenian Service reported that Petros Makeyan chairman of the opposition Democratic Homeland party was detained early on February 25 The circumstances of his detention are unclear  I would evaluate the situation very negatively says Mikael Danielian chairman of the Armenian Helsinki Association Even though the authorities are not resorting to wide use of force these permanent arrests of Levon TerPetrossians supporters  which sometimes look like kidnappings with the detainees allowed to meet their lawyers only the following day  all this indicates that the authorities are trying to stifle the movement by use of force  RFERL Caucasus analyst Liz Fuller says the recent detentions may be part of the outgoing presidents attempts to tie the protests to a conspiracy plot  If the allegations of illegal weapons possession are not true then they are clearly intended to substantiate Robert Kocharians allegations when he met with police and army commanders on Saturday that TerPetrossian is plotting to seize power by illegal means the implication being that he would not stop at violence she says  TerPetrossian has claimed that the arrests are politically motivated First of all this is clearly political matter he said Apart from this I think the authorities are trying to frighten other state officials so that they do not follow Jahangirians example  Among the nine Foreign Ministry officials who have resigned are Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Bayburtian and the ambassadors to Italy Ruben Shugarian and Kazakhstan Levon Khachatrian A diplomat posted in Ukraine Razmik Khumarian and a ministry spokesman Vladimir Karapetian were also dismissed  The opposition has vowed to make the protests a permanent feature in central Yerevan unless a new vote is held But as analyst Fuller explains the government seems willing to wait the situation out believing it has the support of the international community  Serzh Sarkisian has a reputation as a gambler she says One would therefore suspect that he has very very strong nerves and he is waiting for the other side to blink first I suspect that Sarkisian and Kocharian are firmly convinced that the international community is on their side and that if they simply wait in a week or two weeks  or even longer  the protests will fizzle out  In its preliminary assessment the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europes OSCE electionmonitoring body the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ODIHR has said the vote was mostly in line with the countrys international commitments although further improvements are necessary  The votecounting process was assessed negatively at about 16 percent of the polling stations visited by ODIHR observers  Nevertheless the elections have been endorsed by the European Union and while not congratulating Sarkisian personally the US State Department has congratulated the Armenian people on an active and competitive election while also noting significant problems with electoral proceduresSarkisian has received messages of congratulation on his election win from the presidents of Russia France Georgia and Turkey

https://www.rferl.org/a/1079498.html,Armenia FAQ About Februarys Presidential Election ,"February 18, 2008 15:31 GMT",,There is virtually no expectation that the February 19 election in Armenia will be free or fair Is there at least a degree of choiceThe problem is that Armenia has had just one presidential election that was perceived as free and fair and that was in October 1991 when Levon TerPetrossian was first elected president In September 1996 when he came up for reelection the results of the first round were rigged to preclude a runoff between him and his former Prime Minister Vazgen Manukian Then after TerPetrossians ouster in 1998 and 2003  both times when the candidate of the party of power was Robert Kocharian  on both occasions the election went to the second round and both times the opposition called foul and insisted that the ballot was rigged in Kocharians favor Therefore people are not enthusiasticSince Kocharian came to power ten years ago a small group of people a small elite has accumulated enormous economic power And it goes without saying that this small elite clustered around Kocharian and Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian are not going to give up power the huge fortunes and the economic influence that they have And all the indications that we have seen in the past few months is that the authorities are preparing to engineer an outcome that would bring Serzh Sarkisian to power as president The use of economic resources the way that budget employees are being told if you dont vote for Serzh Sarkisian then you wont get your salaries the way that the statecontrolled media has consistently pushed Serzh Sarkisians candidacy while denigrating the rival candidates in particular former President TerPetrossianHow have Armenias elections compared with others in the region in recent historyArmenia has had just one election that was seen as free and fair and that was in 1991 Since then all the elections in Armenia  whether parliamentary or presidential  have been marred by some degree of rigging but not to the extent that the OSCE has come out and said these elections were not free and fair The formulation used has always been something like they were not totally consistent with the requirements for They were fudgedThe degree of falsification in Armenia over the past 10 years has been less than in Azerbaijan where the authorities have openly and blatantly moved to rig the elections Even in the presence of OSCE observers when the votes were being counted they would manipulate and overstate the number of votes cast for either the incumbent president or the ruling partyIn Georgia  the 2004 elections that brought Mikhail Saakashvili to power were viewed as free and fair But again there were questions over last months ballot when Saakashvili according to official returns just managed by the skin of his teeth to win the reelection in the first round So the entire region has a pretty checkered history And the number of ballots that have been considered as free and fair has been minimalClaiming he is the only true challenger TerPetrossian has expressed his anger with opposition candidate Artur Baghdasarians decision not to support him and has said that Baghdasarian is essentially backing Sarkisian Does Baghdasarian have a chance to make it to the second round in his own rightYes he does have a chance Hes the youngest candidate  hes 39  hes charismatic hes populist Hes made some very populist economic promises in terms of residing salaries and cutting taxes The question is whether the authorities decide to go for broke and engineer and outcome in the first round that would preclude a second round or whether they will finesse it and give Serzh Sarkisian just under 50 percent of the vote in the first round in order to demonstrate that they are really being fair In which case it would be very very difficult to predict who the second candidate would be whether it would be Baghdasarian or TerPetrossian who apparently does have huge supportHow much has the failure of the opposition to unite behind a single candidate harmed its chances against Sarkisian Its very difficult to say without having some idea of exactly how many people will turn out and vote or how many people is so disenchanted that they wont vote In a fair election the failure to unite behind a single candidate could work in the oppositions favor if all the opposition candidates together managed to deprive Sarkisian of the 50 percent in the first roundDo you expect the election to go to a second roundI honestly would not like to predict at this stage There was an opinion poll conducted I think last week or the week before by a British company that gave Sarkisian marginally over 50 percent of the vote And the margin of error is such that its very difficult to say It could go either way Given that in the last two elections there has been a runoff it would seem logical that there should be one this time round as well Especially as this time you have two strong challengers  you have Baghdasarian and TerPetrossian rather than simply oneA cynic would say that whether or not there is a second round would depend wholly on whether or not a second round would make an ultimate victory for Serzh Sarkisian appear more natural or convincingHow is it that TerPetrossian the man who oversaw Armenias victory in NagornoKarabakh as president is now perceived by his opponents as being defeatist on the issue of formally resolving the conflictThis perception has arisen from the way in which first not so much TerPetrossians rivals as commentators and even the international community have interpreted the comments that TerPetrossian made first at a press conference in September 1997 and then in his long article called War Or Peace which was published in November In July 1997 the OSCE Minsk group came up with a draft peace proposal that Armenia accepted but NagornoKarabakh rejected They came up with a second draft proposal in September  again NagornoKarabakh rejected it It was because of these two rejections by the NagornoKarabakh Armenians  partly because of that  that TerPetrossian began to argue look time is not on our side the only way to resolve this conflict is through a compromise and the longer we wait to resolve it the weaker Armenia will be economically the stronger Azerbaijan will be economically And in five or 10 years time we could be in a position where the offer thats made to us is far less favorable than whats on the table now He didnt argue specifically for giving up any claims for Karabakh independenceThe circumstances of TerPetrossians resignation in February 1998 were always ambiguous He never said in his resignation speech I am resigning because people dont like my Karabakh policy It was deliberately fudged and everyone assumed that it was because Robert Kocharian and Serzh Sarkisian were opposed to the Karabakh policy that they decided to oust him TerPetrossians closest adviser has hinted that there were other reasons entirely but he has never gone public with them This is something we may never know or we may only know it 10 or 20 years timeFollowing a visit to Moscow last week where he reportedly met with president in waiting Dmitry Medvedev TerPetrossian claimed to have secured Russias backing for his presidential bid This followed a visit by Russian officials to Armenia which was taken by many as evidence of the Kremlins support for Sarkisian How big a role does Russias backing play in this electionIts not so much a question of Russias backing as that Russia has huge interests in Armenia The Russian military base in Armenia is the only one that Russia has left in the South Caucasus now that its pulled out of Georgia And secondly Russia has huge economic interests in Armenia The Russians have bought up most of Armenias industrial enterprises that could be turned round and really made a profit Theres a big Russian economic interest thereRussia is interested in stability and the last thing that Russia wants to see in Armenia is another Orange Revolution that would sweep Serzh Sarkisian away and bring back TerPetrossian possibly with a new team of people Russia has a vested interest in seeing a smooth transition of power We dont know for an absolute certainty that TerPetrossian actually did meet with Dmitry Medvedev and we certainly dont know what sort of assurances  if any  TerPetrossian managed to get from the Russian leadership I would suspect that his trop to Moscow was a PR stunt and it may not have turned out the way he hoped it wouldTerPetrossian has vowed to take to the streets on Wednesday if there is an attempt to falsify the vote Sarkisian meanwhile has said that peaceful demonstrations will be tolerated but that any violence will be countered by lawenforcement with all its power How real is the threat of violenceIt is not in the interest of either side  either of TerPetrossian or of the Armenian authorities  for any potential standoff to degenerate into violence or bloodshedTerPetrossian is already a legend by virtue of the role that played in the Karabakh movement and the fact that he was the first president of an independent Armenia Its not in his interests to risk compromising that reputation by triggering violence For that reason I would suspect that TerPetrossian himself will be circumspect that if you have tens of thousands of people out there on the streets rallying in your support its terribly terribly easy for one of TerPetrossians supporters to start throwing stones at police and then for the police to react violently and TerPetrossian would be blamed I would very much hope that there is no violenceIts certainly not in the interests of Serzh Sarkisian for there to be violence The Armenian authorities one would hope would have learned a lesson from the international communitys reaction to the violence suppression by police in Tbilisi last November of what were more or less peaceful protests Both sides will need to keep a very cool head and one would hope that there wont be any violence or bloodshedWhat next for KocharianThis is one of the big unanswered questions There has been lots of speculation that Armenia would duplicate the Russian scenario and that Serzh Sarkisian would appoint Robert Kocharian his prime minister after the election But Serzh Sarkisian has not yet said anything either that would even hint at that let alone confirm that possibility So this is simply one of the things they are going to have to wait and see how things turn outInterview conducted by Michael Scollon
https://www.rferl.org/a/1079496.html,Armenia Race For Presidency Offers New Debate Over Old Taboo ,"February 18, 2008 14:09 GMT",,Ten years ago this month Armenias first president fell victim to a dismal economic situation and NagornoKarabakh Having served one term and half of another at war with Azerbaijan over the Armenianpopulated province Levon TerPetrossians calls for compromise were branded weak and defeatist by his political adversariesAnd with those words he was goneThe government bodies known to you have presented me a resignation demand TerPetrossian said Taking into account that the execution of the constitutional power of the president in the situation that has been created could pose serious danger to the stability of the country I accept that demand and announce my resignationAt the time TerPetrossian said his resignation was due to deep problems connected with what he called the alternative between peace and war In short he told Armenians the party of peace and respectful reconciliation has been defeatedOnce BurnedAfter 10 years in seclusion where he quietly busied himself in academia TerPetrossian returned to active politics in September to take on two of the men largely responsible for his ouster in 1998One of them Robert Kocharian is now ending his second term as president His preferred successor fellow NagornoKarabakh native and current Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian is the secondSome Frequently Asked Questions about the vote through the eyes of RFERL analyst Liz FullerWith his return TerPetrossian significantly altered the political status quo dominated by Kocharian and Sarkisian He has also provided new stimulus to one of the most emotional issues in Armenia NagornoKarabakhIn an interview with RFERL on February 17 TerPetrossian stood by his view that international mediators current proposals to end the NagornoKarabakh conflict are remarkably similar to their 1997 peace plan which he strongly advocated and which was rejected as defeatist by his political adversariesAfter having wasted so many years the current authorities of Armenia have quietly and secretly agreed to a plan that they had diligently presented as defeatist and treacherous in the past TerPetrossian told a rally in Yerevan in OctoberThe authorities argue that the current plan differs significantly from that plan in that it makes clear that NagornoKarabakhs status will be determined through a referendum on selfdetermination And harkening back to 1998 Kocharian and Sarkisian routinely accused TerPetrossian of selling and betraying the disputed region 10 years ago to Azerbaijan and warn that in the event of victory TerPetrossian will surrender KarabakhTerPetrossian has countered by accusing Kocharian of complicity in great conspiracy against the republic of Armenia by agreeing in 1999 to a land swap with Azerbaijan The purported deal according to TerPetrossian would have stripped Armenia of its vital land border with Iran in exchange for NagornoKarabakhTerPetrossian backs his claim by saying Kocharian attempted to get thenPrime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian no relation to Serzh to accept the idea in the presence of a US official just hours before Vazgen Sarkisian and seven other officials were assassinated in parliament in October 1999 TerPetrossian alleges Sarkisian rejected the proposed peace deal with Azerbaijan and stormed out of the meetingKocharian who has campaigned stridently in support of Serzh Sarkisian strongly denies TerPetrossians allegations about the alleged landswap agreement I dont swap Armenian land for Armenian land Kocharian told major television stations on February 17 We have not lost a single square meter of land during my presidencyTom de Waal Caucasus editor for the Londonbased Institute for War and Peace Reporting calls the accusations exaggerated saying they are more a reflection of electioneering than reality This rehearsal of the plans from the past which the public knows about they are all coming out in the open de Waal says Both sides are making rather exaggerated accusations and both sides accusing the other of trying to sell Armenian interests And it does very much look like electoral politics more than the reality of the actual plansCompeting VisionsMuch of the feuding between the two Armenian camps stems from differing approaches to settling the NagornoKarabakh conflict that were considered after a ceasefire was reached in 1994The socalled phased approach  the advocacy of which played a major part in TerPetrossians ouster  calls for tackling the issue stepbystepAmong the issues that would have to be resolved before a settlement could be reached would be ensuring the security of NagornoKarabakhs Armenian population the return of tens of thousands of Azeri refugees and the withdrawal of Armenian forces occupying seven Azerbaijani districts bordering KarabakhThe package solution  initially backed by Kocharian and Serzh Sarkisian  advocates resolving all outstanding issues in one fell swoop with the aim of legitimizing Karabakhs secession from AzerbaijanAghasi Yenokian a Yerevanbased political analyst says that over time the phased approach has emerged as the preferred basis for a solution Interview RFERL Talks To TerPetrossian History has shown that a package solution as such does not exist Ten years have passed since TerPetrossian was removed from power And throughout all these years every initiative that emerged was based on a stepbystep principle Yenokian says The package solution was impossible be it from a political or a technical perspectiveDe Waal agrees saying the main difference between the two political camps in Armenia today lies in their general approach to resolving the disputeI think TerPetrossian is different in approach he says that this is an issue in which time is not on our side an issue which we never solved issue which we have to tackle de Waal says And I think this is the important difference because the others are basically saying Yes we do want to solve the Karabakh problem but basically we won the war so let the other side do most of the talking we are fairly comfortableThis de Waal adds is the important distinction Its not about the technical details but about how urgently they think the problem needs to be solvedThe More Things ChangeTo some observers the fact that the past is being so actively revisited during the presidential campaign could signal that the issue of resolving the dispute over NagornoKarabakh through compromise with Azerbaijan may no longer be a taboo topic in the minds of the Armenian publicWhile Sarkisian is still widely considered the frontrunner in the race TerPetrossians ability to attract tens of thousands of people to his rallies suggests that his views on NagornoKarabakh are not without considerable supportBut Stepan Grigorian director of the Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in Yerevan notes that divisiveness on this very sensitive question leads TerPetrossian to tread carefullyBecause of all this in his campaign Levon TerPetrossian when speaking about the necessity to improve relations with Azerbaijan or the necessity to accept compromises in relation to solving of the Karabakh conflict does not provide many details Grigorian says Because as soon as he tries to do this a hostile campaign is launched against him even though significantly large segments of society are now accepting the idea of compromiseFor de Waal if the Armenian public appears more open to compromise on NagornoKarabakh it has more to do with Armenians waking up to new realities than to any major shift in their feelings on the issueI think 10 years ago  when TerPetrossian gave his famous press conference and then published an article called War or Peace talking about the need to compromise  there was mass hostility to his ideas partly because he did not make the case very well He also said There are only six people in Armenia who understand the Karabakh problem which was a statement that was guaranteed to annoy the public de Waal says Ten years later I dont think things have changed that much but maybe people are aware that Azerbaijan is going much stronger their military budget is growing that they have oil revenues So I think maybe there is a little more acceptance in Armenia that this is a topic which wont go away and that we should take another look at itDe Waal stresses that the establishment of a real peace process over NagornoKarabakh is still a distant prospect as Armenias and Azerbaijans positions remain far apartThis is a subject which is capable of mobilizing the public like no other issue in both countries he notes So it would be quite dangerous for any leader who wants to make any compromises on this issue There will be demonstrations on the street there will be threats It will be a very very difficult issue to handleRFERLs Armenian Service

https://www.rferl.org/a/1079486.html,Armenia Will Murder Allegations Impact On Presidential Vote ,"February 15, 2008 18:23 GMT",Addressing a campaign rally on January 24 in Charentsavan TerPetrossian implicated outgoing President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian widely regarded as the favorite in the February 19 ballot in the October 1999 parliament shootings in which a group of disaffected gunmen killed eight senior officials including thenPrime Minister Vazgen Sargsian and parliament speaker Karen Demirchian ,Addressing a campaign rally on January 24 in Charentsavan TerPetrossian implicated outgoing President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian widely regarded as the favorite in the February 19 ballot in the October 1999 parliament shootings in which a group of disaffected gunmen killed eight senior officials including thenPrime Minister Vazgen Sargsian and parliament speaker Karen Demirchian Two weeks later on February 9 TerPetrossian told tens of thousands of supporters in Yerevan that those two men were killed because of their objections to a USbacked proposal for resolving the Karabakh conflict that would have entailed Armenia ceding its southernmost Meghri district in exchange for formal international recognition of NagornoKarabakh as part of Armenia TerPetrossian claimed that Kocharian Sarkisian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian all approved that optionSuch allegations of a connection between the alleged proposed territorial exchange and the 1999 parliament shootings are not new they were discussed in detail in the August 3 2000 issue of the Armenian daily Aravot and three months later on November 10 2000 Yerevan Mayor Albert Bazeyan claimed he had been recently informed by oppositionist Ashot Manucharian that the OSCE Minsk Group which since 1992 has sought to mediate a solution to the Karabakh conflict proposed such an exchange to Kocharian According to Manucharian Kocharian approved the idea but Sargsian and Demirchian opposed it whereupon the OSCE cochairs  not the Armenian leadership  engineered their deaths in the parliament shootings Senior Armenian officials including both Kocharian and Oskanian have made no secret of the fact that a territorial swap was one of various approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict that has been discussed and then abandoned as unacceptable andor unworkable Kocharian disclosed in February 2000 that international mediators had again proposed the prospect of a territorial exchange to resolve the Karabakh conflict and that he discussed that possibility during one of his meetings with his Azerbaijani counterpart Heidar Aliyev But both Kocharian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian subsequently said repeatedly that the Armenian side rejected such a territorial exchange out of hand On November 22 2000 thenArmenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ara Papian was similarly quoted by Zhamanak as saying that the OSCE proposed a territorial swap first in 1992 and then in 1999 but that both the Armenian authorities and the leadership of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh republic rejected it on both occasions A spokesman for Kocharian rejected TerPetrossians allegation on February 9 as a cheap preelection ploy Then on February 13 Oskanian who has served as point man for the Karabakh peace process since 1997 went on record as affirming that that none of the three draft Karabakh peace proposals submitted by the OSCE Minsk Group to the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan since TerPetrossians ouster in February 1998 contained any mention of the possibility of Armenia ceding Meghri to Azerbaijan in exchange for international recognition of NagornoKarabakh as Armenian territory Oskanian pointed out that the idea of a territorial swap was the brainchild in 1992 of former US State Department analyst Paul Goble but that what became known as the Goble plan never figured officially as a component of any OSCEdrafted peace proposal Oskanian accused TerPetrossian of acting immorally suggesting that he will stop at nothing to achieve his political goal of again becoming president of Armenia NovostiArmenia reportedThere is an element of irony in TerPetrossians attempt to use Sarkisians purported involvement in the 1999 parliament shootings and his alleged willingness to cede Armenian territory as a means of undermining his credibility with voters Conventional wisdom has it that it was TerPetrossians conciliatory approach to resolving the Karabakh conflict that motivated Kocharian Sarkisian and Vazgen Sargsian to engineer his forced resignation in February 1998 although TerPetrossians former adviser Zhirayr Libaridian implied in his The Challenges of Statehood that other factors entirely were behind that decisionEven prior to TerPetrossians February 9 allegations Sarkisian warned that unnamed candidates who engage in slander will be held legally responsible once the election is over But setting aside the moral and legal implications of TerPetrossians statements the question arises why did he wait to go public with them until so late in the election campaign Two days earlier TerPetrossian filed a formal request with the Constitutional Court to order measures to remove obstacles to his campaign activities specifically the consistently negative coverage of his campaign by major statecontrolled television channels Under the provisions of Armenias election law failure to remove such obstacles necessitates the postponement of the election by two weeks The Constitutional Court on February 11 recognized TerPetrossians complaint as valid and ordered the obstacles to be removed but declined to order a postponement of the vote after which TerPetrossian flew to Moscow where he reportedly met with top Russian officials The purpose and timing of that trip is likewise puzzling is TerPetrossian aware of some Russian involvement in the 1999 parliament shootings and might he have presented Russian leaders with an ultimatum drop your support for Serzh Sarkisian or I go public with this damaging materialTwo other factors may have influenced the timing of TerPetrossians trip to Moscow a fire during the night of February 89 badly damaged the top two stories of the Armenian Justice Ministry building including much of the evidence and records from the investigation into the parliament shooting Firefighters called to extinguish the blaze made only token efforts to do so an eyewitness told RFERL And second February 9 was the last day on which any of the nine registered presidential candidates could step down and pledge their support for another Despite rumors that he would do so former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian failed to pull out of the race and endorse TerPetrossian although RFERLs Armenian Service quoted him as saying on February 11 that he might still do so on February 15 or 16It remains unclear how eight years after the event TerPetrossians allegation of Sarkisians partial responsibility for the parliament shootings will resonate with those voters who are still undecided TerPetrossians rival candidates almost without exception have focused primarily in their campaign statements on the need to eradicate corruption raise living standards and create new jobs issues that are presumably closer to the hearts of much of the electorate than unsubstantiated allegations of murder and willingness to cede Armenian territory Finally even if widely held suspicions that Armenias current elite fully intends to rig the outcome of the ballot to ensure the transfer of presidential power from Kocharian to Sarkisian are unfounded some members of that elite may have been so angered by TerPetrossians allegations that they might intervene in the process of vote tabulation to ensure that the official election results show minimal support for himRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan ,Azerbaijans recent windfall of oil and gas revenues appears to have persuaded Aliyev that he could turn the tables on Armenia which has long held the military upper hand in the dispute over NagornoKarabakh a predominantly ethnicArmenian territory located within Azerbaijan In talks on February 4 with Slovenian Foreign Minister Dmitrij Rupel who was representing the current EU Presidency Aliyev indicated Baku was contemplating waging war for control of the disputed territory which together with a strip of adjacent Azerbaijani territory has been under Yerevans control since a 198894 war between the two countries Benita FerreroWaldner the EUs external relations commissioner tells RFERL that Brussels firmly rejected Bakus inflammatory rhetoric I clearly said not only to the authorities but also at the press conference that I think it is highly important that they avoid any inflammatory speech at the moment of presidential elections she saysBoth countries are holding a presidential vote this year  Armenia on February 19 and Azerbaijan in October The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE which has spent more than 15 years mediating talks between the two sides has indicated an election year is not likely to see major progress on the issue Baku however appears impatient The Azerbaijani leadership Rupel said appears to feel that time is not on Armenias side Nor is money Azerbaijans defense budget this year will exceed 1 billion Armenias is just onethird of that figure Azerbaijan has enjoyed spectacular economic growth over the past few years The countrys GDP grew by 25 percent in 2007 almost exclusively on the strength of oil and gas exports Azerbaijans minister for economic development Heydar Babayev says he expects his government to generate upward of 150 billion in oil and gas revenues by 2015Armenia meanwhile has no lucrative natural resources It is landlocked blockaded by neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan and  at Bakus behest  bypassed by oil and gas pipelines as well as rail and road projects which originate in AzerbaijanWinning The PeaceBut as Rupel notes Armenia has alliances that speak for it This is a reference to Russian backing Throughout the NagornoKarabakh conflict Russia is rumored to have given Armenia military equipment worth 1 billion Russia provides for most of Armenias energy needs and has bought up most of its energy infrastructureThe Armenian government did not appeared cowed by Bakus fighting words Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian tells RFERL that Armenia is confident of its military capability No matter how strong the Azeris will be in the next 15 years even with this kind of spending even if it doubled every year to catch up with Armenias commitment to defend itself and Karabakh that will require as a minimum 1520 years he saysOskanian says that Armenia would not be intimidated in any event More importantly he adds he does not believe there can be a military solution to NagornoKarabakh We fought twice with the Azeris we prevailed but we never claimed that we won the war he says Unless we win the peace we will never claim that we won the warOskanian acknowledges however that the chances of winning the peace are receding and that Azerbaijans positions in the OSCEmediated peace talks have hardenedRupel  an old OSCE hand having chaired the organization in 2005  also fears the Minsk Group which oversees the mediation efforts may face increasing obstinacy from BakuNagornoKarabakh is a key issue in both countries election campaigns and establishment candidates are expected to win in both countries meaning novel approaches to the problem are not likely to be forthcomingTaking a longerterm view Rupel says the conflict is rooted in the regions Soviet past when Josef Stalin arranged their borders in a way apparently designed to exacerbate ethnic strife Rupel says both Armenia and Azerbaijan need a generational change You know a new generation younger people would deal with problems like NagornoKarabakh in an easier way he says I think we have to rely on a new generation of politicians on both sides There has been some generational change in Azerbaijan as you know Well see how it happens here in Armenia Certainly it is not a pleasant situationAnd what of the EUs role Rupel says the EUs Neighborhood Policy is as balanced as possible between the two countries The EU he says is very careful not to upset one side or the other with even its economic assistance being as similar as possibleBut money appears to be no object in this standoff The EU has not been directly involved in the peace talks and there appears to be little wish on either side for it to engage As an ally in a conflict meanwhile the EU remains of little use

opposition fire for capitalizing on his personal control  and that of the Republican Party of Armenia HHK which he heads  over many government bodies to gain extensive coverage by leading television stations and ensure high turnout at his campaign rallies across the country Speaking in parliament on February 6 Sarkisian argued that the Armenian Electoral Code does not explicitly bar him from combining his primeministerial duties with electionrelated activities  As you know elections in Armenia are monitored by numerous observers Sarkisian said in response to a question from an opposition parliamentarian And if the observers say that I as you claim have blatantly violated the law and inflicted great damage on the country I will think about this issue  Sarkisian went on to deny local media reports that schoolteachers students and other publicsector employees are forced to attend his campaign rallies You can try and meet those people attending Sarkisians rallies and ask whether they are kept there by police or army cordons he said The reputation of Armenias future president is very dear to me and I will do everything in my power to ensure that Armenias future president has a good reputation a statement that seemingly reflects supreme confidence in his election chances Addressing a cabinet session on February 7 Sarkisian warned the heads of local HHK branches local

Election Commission it totaled 263 million drams 85000 as of January 31 well below the 70 milliondram limit set by the Electoral Code Opposition politicians dismiss the figure as fraudulent saying that such a modest sum could not have enabled Sarkisian to flood Yerevan and just about every Armenian town and village with his campaign billboards and posters  TerPetrossians camp has also cried foul over Sarkisians December 4 decision to form a special government commission to address citizens grievances saying that its activities amount to vote buying They claim that voters needing financial and other assistance are being referred to the commission by Sarkisians campaign offices  TerPetrossian on February 5 accused the OSCE observers of turning a blind eye to this and other alleged violations They dont see or dont want to see that he said At least there have been no preventive steps no statements on their part Ahrens however said the observer mission is looking into TerPetrossians claims If this is the case then this would of course be a way of using administrative resources that would not be acceptable he said  Ahrens also expressed concern about violence that marred a TerPetrossian election rally on February 6 in Artashat 30 kilometers south of Yerevan A group of progovernment youths there scuffled with TerPetrossians loyalists and pelted them with stones in an apparent attempt to disrupt the gathering TerPetrossian condemned the incident which was witnessed by two OSCE observers as a government provocation aimed at derailing his campaign Lawenforcement authorities claimed however that TerPetrossian and his allies themselves provoked it by making offensive remarks about Deputy Prime Minister Hovik Abrahamian Sarkisians Artashatbased campaign manager  We will certainly investigate this incident Ahrens said We have longterm observers everywhere in the country They will talk to all those involved and then submit a report to us Then on that basis we can form our judgment on this incident Whoever is to blame any such incident is deplorable he added

opposition contender former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian kicked off his campaign under the slogan A civic movement for new Armenia with an official presentation of his 32page election manifesto in Yerevan My victory will eliminate corruption and embezzlement rooted in the country he told journalists and activists of his Orinats Yerkir LawBased State party on January 21 My victory will mean equality before law a drastic rise in the living standards of the people of Armenia  Baghdasarian dismissed claims by government loyalists that the Armenian opposition cannot prevent the handover of power from outgoing President Robert Kocharian to Sarkisian because it has failed to close ranks and back a single presidential candidate There are and there will be alliances he said without elaborating As for the authorities they are not united either he added pointing to the participation in the ballot of a candidate from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutiun HHD a junior partner in the governing coalition HHD candidate Vahan Hovannisian held a similar campaign event in Yerevan later on January 21 at which he listed as his primary objectives dismantling the existing system of economic monopolies promoting intensive economic development increasing exports enhancing the role of the armed forces and securing the participation of representatives of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic in the ongoing talks aimed at resolving the Karabakh conflict Noyan Tapan reported on January 22  Also meeting journalists on January 21 was another opposition candidate National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian Rather than outline his campaign program Geghamian again focused on attacking TerPetrossian and denouncing what he called a barbaric smear campaign waged against him by opposition newspapers Some opposition media outlets have suggested that Geghamian was bribed by the authorities to enter the fray with the sole aim of discrediting TerPetrossian  Geghamians opposition credentials were also questioned over the weekend by the Zharangutiun Heritage party of Raffi Hovannisian no relation to Vahan a major opposition group that has so far declined to endorse any of the presidential hopefuls Mr Geghamians recent political behavior raises questions about his being in opposition and reinforces the governments positions Hovsep

seemed beyond doubt in light of his control of administrative resources and the absence of any credible challenger but the October decision by Kocharians predecessor Levon TerPetrossian to participate in the ballot opens the possibility that as was the case in 1998 and 2003 a runoff will be required TerPetrossians decision also effectively demolished the possibility that the opposition might field a single challenger to Sarkisian The leaders of five opposition parties met in August 2007 to explore that option but failed to reach any agreement ,Six months ago Sarkisians victory in the first round of voting seemed beyond doubt in light of his control of administrative resources and the absence of any credible challenger but the October decision by Kocharians predecessor Levon TerPetrossian to participate in the ballot opens the possibility that as was the case in 1998 and 2003 a runoff will be required TerPetrossians decision also effectively demolished the possibility that the opposition might field a single challenger to Sarkisian The leaders of five opposition parties met in August 2007 to explore that option but failed to reach any agreement  TerPetrossian who is 63 and an oriental scholar spent a decade in obscurity writing a history of the Crusades after being forced by Kocharian and Sarkisian in February 1998 to resign In two key addresses on September 21 and October 26 announcing his comeback bid and intention to run for president TerPetrossian excoriated the present leadership as an institutionalized mafiastyle regime that has plunged us into the ranks of thirdworld countries and jeopardized all chance of achieving a settlement of the Karabakh conflict on terms acceptable to Armenia He further accused Kocharian Sarkisian and their inner circle of personally controlling the most lucrative forms of economic activity through direct ownership of businesses or state racketeering    Kocharian retaliated on October 31 accusing TerPetrossian and his Armenian PanNational Movement of destroying the countrys economy within a few years of coming to power and bequeathing him in 1998 a country with a ruined economy Sarkisian for his part on November 10 advised TerPetrossian to repent and apologize to the Armenian people for his errors Then on November 16 TerPetrossian apologized to the Armenian population for having committed disastrous errors of judgment during his tenure as president from 199198 of which he identified as the most serious having brought Kocharian and Sarkisian from NagornoKarabakh to occupy senior posts in the Armenian government  Even before that Armenian tax and law enforcement agencies began systematically harassing people and media outlets that openly supported TerPetrossian Last month tax inspectors impounded thousands of campaign flyers as a member of TerPetrossians campaign staff took delivery of them from a Yerevan printing firm Noyan Tapans veteran political commentator David Petrossian noted in a December 2 analysis that TerPetrossians campaign team was distributing DVDs of his addresses of September 21 and October 26 in a bid to obviate the refusal of virtually all Armenian television channels to give him air time  Of a total of 12 candidates who initially sought to register nine succeeded in doing so USborn former Foreign Minister and Zharangutiun Heritage party Chairman Raffi Hovannisian was denied registration on the grounds that he acquired Armenian citizenship only in 2001 Armenias election law stipulates that presidential candidates must have been citizens of the Republic of Armenia for a minimum of 10 years prior to the ballot Zharangutiun subsequently declined to throw its support behind another candidate Nor Zhamanakner New Times party leader Aram Karapetian was similarly denied registration as he has not lived permanently in Armenia for the past decade No explanation was given as to why that requirement did not render him ineligible to register for the 2003 presidential election in which he polled fourth with 295 percent of the vote  In addition to Sarkisian and TerPetrossian the remaining seven candidates are Orinats Yerkir party Chairman Artur Baghdasarian who was constrained to resign as parliament speaker in May 2006 following a public polemic with Kocharian over NATO membership opposition National Democratic Union Chairman Vazgen Manukian who served under TerPetrossian in the early 1990s as defense minister and prime minister and was his main challenger in the 1996 presidential election Vahan Hovannisian no relation to Raffi of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD whose party although aligned with the HHKled coalition government declined to back Sarkisians candidacy National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian who ran unsuccessfully in the presidential elections in 1998 and 2003 Peoples Party Chairman Tigran Karapetian National Accord Party AMK Chairman Aram Harutiunian and Arman Melikian who was foreignpolicy adviser to Arkady Ghuksian the former president of the unrecognized republic of NagornoKarabakh  Of those seven two  Geghamian and Hovannisian  are vying to be acknowledged as the third force capable of creaming off enough votes to deny the frontrunner the 50 percentplusone vote required for a firstround victory and thus force a second round RFERLs Armenian Service reported on December 13 Hovannisian told journalists that it is unfortunate that Armenia is entering the election period with two hostile poles A threehorse race will totally change the situation It will expose the real force At the same time Hovannisian implied that the HHD will not pull out of the government in the event that he is elected president While Hovannisian has every reason to resent both TerPetrossian who banned his party in December 1994 and had Hovannisian arrested on terrorism charges and Sarkisian who as TerPetrossians interior minister was personally involved in that crackdown he nonetheless hopes for a strong election showing that would cement the HHDs position within the coalition government  Geghamians primary motive in registering for the ballot was to thwart TerPetrossians comeback plans AMK Deputy Chairman Aleksan Karapetian told journalists on November 27 Geghamian has repeatedly attacked TerPetrossian as a political lightweight whose loyalists he claims plan to provoke violent unrest at polling stations and thus unleash civil war RFERLs Armenian Service reported on December 13 Some observers believes Geghamians campaign is being financed by Sarkisian with the aim of splitting the opposition vote Opinion polls however show that Baghdasarian stands the greatest chance of forcing Sarkisian into a runoff  An impressive number of small political parties and public organizations have nonetheless pledged support for TerPetrossian including former Prime Minister Aram Sargsians Hanrapetutiun party and the Peoples Party of Armenia headed by Stepan Demirchian who lost to Kocharian in the second round of the FebruaryMarch 2003 presidential election But several other opposition leaders clearly share Geghamians misgivings about the former president Both Manukian and Baghdasarian rejected TerPetrossians November 16 appeal for their support Manukian told journalists in Yerevan on November 20 that while he would dearly like to see the present Armenian leadership replaced he does not think a return to power by TerPetrossian would improve the situation There are people who consider Levon TerPetrossian the lesser evil but there are also many many people who consider Serzh Sarkisian the lesser evil And I dont rule out the possibility that if Levon TerPetrossian and Serzh Sarkisian go into a second round Serzh Sarkisian will emerge as the legitimate president Manukian said Manukian was pessimistic about the chances of any opposition candidate defeating Sarkisian given the latters control of administrative resources financial resources and the entire election process  In midDecember the proTerPetrossian newspaper Haykakan zhamanak published what it claimed were excerpts from Manukians private papers confiscated by security forces during the crackdown that followed the 1996 presidential election The notes allegedly made by Manukian stress the need to recruit informers within the government during the election campaign to provide him with confidential information and advocate heightening existing tensions if necessary by resorting to assassinations and acts of terrorism in the runup to the vote  The HHD distanced itself from TerPetrossian in late October when the partys de facto head Hrant Markarian dismissed TerPetrossians criticisms of the present leadership as too radical and lacking in selfcriticism RFERLs Armenian Service reported on October 30  In his landmark address of November 1 1997 analyzing the prospects for resolving the Karabakh conflict TerPetrossian defined the choice facing Armenia as between the bad and the even worse Many Armenians who recall the economic collapse they experienced during TerPetrossians presidency and the allegations of spectacular corruption surrounding some of his close associates may now view the upcoming presidential ballot in the same terms

found that onefifth of the 193 countries it studied suffered setbacks last year None of the states that earned the lowest designation not free in 2006 showed any improvement last year and it was the first time in the reports 15year history that a twoyear decline had been recorded,In its annual Freedom Of The World report released today the New Yorkbased group Freedom House found that onefifth of the 193 countries it studied suffered setbacks last year None of the states that earned the lowest designation not free in 2006 showed any improvement last year and it was the first time in the reports 15year history that a twoyear decline had been recordedThe countries of the former Soviet Union were among the worst performers with parliamentary elections late in the year in Russia rated not free highlighting the perilous environment in the regions most influential stateIts fair to say that freedom is seriously lacking in this region or unit that is to say the former Soviet Union Freedom House Director of Studies Chris Walker told RFERL Of the 12 nonBaltic former Soviet republics seven of those are assessed by Freedom House as not free four are partly free and one is free Ukraine So its a very challenging landscape for freedom in that part of the worldBelarus Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are among the worst of the worst countries in the world in terms of human rights and are joined on the list of not free countries by Azerbaijan and KazakhstanTwo countries looked upon as examples of positive democratic change Georgia and Kyrgyzstan both rated partly free took steps backward  with Russias influence in obstructing reforms being noted in the case of KyrgyzstanThere were big hopes for Kyrgyzstan and Georgia that if new people came to power then the new governments would apply democratic principles by their actions and pressure on the opposition would stop Ilim Karypbekov director of the Media Representative Institute in Kyrgyzstan tells RFERLs Kyrgyz Service However if you look at Georgia protest rally participants were beaten up again Karypbekov continues At the same time international observer missions showed that the Georgian presidential election was held under enormous pressure on the opposition and with the use of administrative resources The same happened in Kyrgyzstans early parliamentary elections in December 2007Joining Kyrgyzstan and Georgia among the former Soviet states considered partly free were Armenia and MoldovaThe best of the bunch is Ukraine which Walker says remains free because it has competing factions with welldefined positions and a population that accepts the results of wellconducted electionsDemocracy in Georgia rated partly free suffered in 2007 due to Presidentelect Mikheil Saakashvilis ability to dominate the political scene The imposition of a state of emergency and a violent police crackdown on opposition rallies late in the year served to highlight the countrys problems according to Freedom House but Walker notes that there is room for vocal dissent in the countryA Semblance Of FreedomRussia is a different matter altogether according to Walker2007 was a pivotal year for authoritarian consolidation in Russia in part due to the manipulated parliamentary elections in December and the managed succession process which really revealed itself by the end of the year where it became very clear that there would not be an opportunity for ordinary Russians to have an open and fair selection of their next president Walker saysA man in Nizhny Novgorod who requested anonymity tells RFERLs Russian Service that Ive never been to other countries so I cant say how the situation in our country is different from theirs But compared to the Soviet Union I dont see any radical changesWe never had freedom even though they tried to create it in the 1990s the man adds What we are left with now at least in my opinion is a semblance of freedomA man in Yekaterinburg meanwhile tells the service that freedoms in Russia cannot be compared with those in European countriesI think were at the level of Central Asian countries where rights and freedoms basically exist on paper but in reality are not upheld he says The presidential election campaign has exceeded all limits because there is a cult of personality and that is taking us back to the pastOf the former communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe most advanced on the road to freedom according to the report Only Latvia  rated free  and Bosnia  rated partly free  showed signs of moving backward during 2007Aneta Grosu editor in chief of the weekly investigative magazine Ziarul de Garda describes the situation in Moldova which retained its partly free ratingYear by year it is more difficult with freedoms in Moldova with press freedom freedom of different opinions human rights Grosu tells RFERLs RomaniaMoldova Service And for us journalists it is more and more difficult to do our job in these circumstances Access to information is more limited there is tougher punishment for what the authorities call libel sometimes we face threats or acts of revenge from people we write aboutThe report characterized Iran as not free and called it a dictatorship accusing it of not only suppressing the rights of its people but also of imposing its influence on other countries through the support of Muslim militantsIraq too is rated not free because it has limited freedom given the persistent sectarian fighting between Shiite and Sunni Muslims that poisons daily life in much of the countryGovernment BacklashWalker says the annual report is meant to be studied by all those with influence in the countries that are rated from government officials to members of the local news media The point to spark debate about how freedoms can be improvedSometimes however governments react with hostility Walker says again pointing to Russia as an exampleThe work of nongovernmental organizations including Freedom House has been increasingly scrutinized in Russia which argues that some countries use such entities work to spread their influence in RussiaRecently Russia opened branches of its own Institute of Democracy and Cooperation in Paris and New York with the intention of improving Russias image abroadThe organizations chairman Anatoly Kucherena recently told The Moscow Times that the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation has no desire to copy the behavior of organizations like Freedom Housewhich has only one goal to publish data which was assembled using methodologies that nobody understands in order to draw attention to themselvesWalker says that attacks on our findings arent based on the substance of the reportAnd he says too often governments criticized in the report fail to debate such findings with the countrys oppositionThe local civil society in the country like Russia should have a right to talk about these findings without fear of reprisal and the hope is that it will help identify areas of concern areas where there are problems areas where there are possibilities for improvement so that domestic institutions can take the steps to make those improvements Walker says I think that ultimately is the fundamental hope hereRFERL correspondent Nikola Krastev interviewed Freedom Houses Christopher Walker

former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzoumanian opened in Yerevan Its coordinating council which comprises representatives of some of the opposition parties allied with TerPetrossian held its first meeting and appointed the heads of its territorial branches in Yerevan on December 29 As of January 8 TerPetrossian has opened local election headquarters in each of Armenias 11 marzes provinces Noyan Tapan reported ,One week earlier TerPetrossians national campaign headquarters to be managed by former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzoumanian opened in Yerevan Its coordinating council which comprises representatives of some of the opposition parties allied with TerPetrossian held its first meeting and appointed the heads of its territorial branches in Yerevan on December 29 As of January 8 TerPetrossian has opened local election headquarters in each of Armenias 11 marzes provinces Noyan Tapan reported  It was decided that the TerPetrossian campaign in Yerevan will be run by Khachatur Sukiasian a wealthy parliamentarian who has been facing a government crackdown on his businesses ever since expressing support last September for TerPetrossians comeback bid Sukiasian will oversee the work of TerPetrossian campaign offices in each of the citys 10 administrative districts Among the heads of those offices are former Interior Minister Suren Abrahamian and Pargev Ohanian a prominent judge who was controversially dismissed by President Robert Kocharian last fall after acquitting two businessmen who accused the State Customs Committee of corruption and extortion    TerPetrosians preelection speeches so far have analyzed in depth controversial episodes from his 199198 presidency as well as the current Armenian governments track record Those evaluations coupled with a retrospective look at the last few decades of Armenian history make up a large part of the published manifesto TerPetrossian who turned 63 on January 9 again denounces the Kocharian administration as a corrupt and criminal regime that tolerates no dissent and is motivated by selfenrichment at the expense of a downtrodden population  The document also lays out his vision for Armenias future It says that if elected TerPetrossian will strive for the dismantling of the existing kleptrocratic system and the establishment of fullfledged democracy anchored in free elections protection of human rights and judicial independence In addition lawenforcement bodies and the military would no longer be used as tools for government repression  TerPetrossians longtime critics however see few fundamental differences between him and Armenias leaders They point among other things to the TerPetrossian administrations failure to hold a single election recognized as free and fair by the international community  TerPetrossians socioeconomic agenda is based on three key principles of marketbased economics that he believes are absent in Armenia a level playing field for all businesspeople fair economic competition and absolute protection of private property While pledging to retrieve what he says are huge amounts of money stolen from the people by wealthy businessmen with ties to the government TerPetrossian says that if elected he would not seek a massive redistribution of property  TerPetrossian further commits himself to launching a crackdown on widespread tax evasion that he says should primarily target large corporate taxpayers that are believed to grossly underreport their earnings thanks to government patronage According to foreign experts only 22 percent of the state budgets tax revenues is currently paid by large entrepreneurs whereas that proportion should have stood at 75 percent his campaign platform claims  In that regard the document reaffirms TerPetrossians pledge to help abolish a governmentdrafted law that took effect on January 1 and that will make it much harder for small Armenian firms to qualify for socalled simplified tax Payment of that tax has exempted them from other heftier duties  According to TerPetrossian these and other economic measures contained in his platform would double Armenias gross domestic product and triple its state budget in the next five years Needless to say that in the event of the resolution of the NagornoKarabakh conflict the lifting of the economic blockades of Armenia and the opening of the TurkishArmenian border much more impressive results could be expected reads the platform During the 1996 presidential election campaign members of the TerPetrossian leadership poured scorn on rival candidate Vazgen Manukians pledge to raise GDP by a similar amount  Responding to TerPetrossians grave allegations Kocharian and Sarkisian have been particularly scathing about his handling of the first years of Armenias painful transition to the free market The Armenian economy shrunk by half in 199293 following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of wars in Karabakh and elsewhere in the South Caucasus Kocharian has charged that the TerPetrossian administration was primarily responsible for turning Armenia into one of the poorest countries in the world  In his manifesto TerPetrossian reaffirms his belief that the collapse of the Soviet economy was inevitable and that it was more drastic in Armenia than in other former Soviet republics because of the Karabakh war and the crippling blockades imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey as well as turmoil in Georgia But he admits that many Armenians do not and will not accept this explanation When a person is worse off today than he was yesterday no logical explanation can satisfy him he says  The document is far less specific on foreignpolicy matters with TerPetrossian saying only that he would strengthen Armenias relations with Russia Georgia and Iran and promising constructive efforts to normalize ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey  On the Karabakh conflict the manifesto says TerPetrossian would display the political will to achieve a compromise peace deal with Azerbaijan that would enable the Armenians of NagornoKarabakh to exercise their right to selfdetermination It does not specify TerPetrossians position on international mediators existing peace proposals

seek to return TerPetrossian to power by means of a new colored revolution such as catapulted Viktor Yushchenko into the presidency of Ukraine analyst Rauf Radjabov told dayaz on October 24 that Washington would have to secure first the agreement of TerPetrossian  who won a convincing and overwhelming victory in the 1991 presidential ballot  to return to power by means of a revolution and then to the complicity of Armenias security services which are currently under the firm control of Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian Incumbent President Robert Kocharian has already identified Sarkisian as his preferred successor and few doubt that he will be elected The Armenian Constitution bars Kocharian from seeking a third consecutive presidential term ,Asked to comment on the possibility that Washington may seek to return TerPetrossian to power by means of a new colored revolution such as catapulted Viktor Yushchenko into the presidency of Ukraine analyst Rauf Radjabov told dayaz on October 24 that Washington would have to secure first the agreement of TerPetrossian  who won a convincing and overwhelming victory in the 1991 presidential ballot  to return to power by means of a

identified Sarkisian as his preferred successor and few doubt that he will be elected The Armenian Constitution bars Kocharian from seeking a third consecutive presidential term The Karabakh ClanRadjabov suggested that what he branded the Karabakh clan is determined to cling to power and would only admit defeat if given castiron guarantees of immunity from prosecution and that its members would not be stripped of the fortunes they amassed while in office Moreover Radjabov noted Russia would be unlikely to condone any move by Washington that would call into question the future of its military base in Armenia  Radjabov did highlight one perceived dangerous consequence for Azerbaijan in the event that Washington does manage to engineer TerPetrossians return to power namely that the United States might exert pressure on Baku to accept a solution to the Karabakh conflict that is damaging to its interests Asim Mollazade who heads the Party for Democratic Reforms similarly stressed that it is unlikely that the Karabakh clan would voluntarily cede power He went on to argue that it is to Azerbaijans advantage that they should not do so given the favorable comparison between the present Azerbaijani leadership and a clan that he described as accustomed to resorting to terror bestial murders and the harsh suppression of dissent to retain power Eldaniz Quliyev of the Movement of Intelligentsia of Azerbaijan similarly reasoned on October 3 that TerPetrossians chances of being elected president are minimal and that it would be to Azerbaijans advantage if Sarkisian whom Quliyev described as leading Armenia toward the precipice at a Stakhanovite pace were to succeed Kocharian Quliyev also dismissed the argument that TerPetrossian might adopt a more conciliatory stance on resolving the Karabakh conflict than Sarkisian At the same time Mollazade cautioned against speculation about a possible colored revolution noting that TerPetrossian has still not formally announced his intention of running for president and it remains unclear how much popular support he enjoys Mollazade also questioned the perception that TerPetrossian is proUS recalling the close military and economic ties with Russia cemented while TerPetrossian was president To date the only Azerbaijani official to have commented on the possibility of a colored revolution in Armenia is Foreign Ministry spokesman Xazar Ibragim In an October 24 interview with dayaz Ibragim noted that any discussion of such a revolution only serves to highlight the weakness of the Armenian state and its leaders inability to implement an independent policy That weakness he continued is the fault of the incumbent leadership and can be overcome only by a shift in foreign policy liberating the districts of Azerbaijan currently occupied by Armenian forces and seeking peaceful coexistence with all the states of the region Ibragim further cautioned against focusing on specific political figures including TerPetrossian reasoning that for Armenia much depends not on who is elected president but on what position he adopts with regard to foreign policy But he did not rule out the hypothetical possibility that a proUS politician could come to power in Armenia resulting in a certain degree of support for Armenia in resolving the Karabakh conflict Ibragim warned however that unlike Armenia Azerbaijan is immune to any such pressure from world powers RFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by email subscribe to

NasibovaThey seek redress against their governments for a wide range of offenses from police abuse to nonpayment of pensions to press freedom violations and failure to fulfill court judgmentsA rising share of these applications come from countries that joined the Council of Europe in the 1990s following the Soviet collapse and where justice is often still shaky Last year the court received 112 cases from Georgia 641 from Moldova and 4146 from UkraineThe judgment Poiata says is a victory for all Moldovan journalists amid a tightening media clampdown These days I work for the Flux newspaper and almost every day I hear this or that colleague has been sued for doing nothing more than quoting other peoples opinions All we journalists do is give people a chance to use their right to express their opinions he saysFreedom Of Speech And AssemblyOne of the latest plaintiffs to win a case at the European Court of Human Rights is Sheyda Nasibova an Azerbaijani citizen who heads a press freedom organization called Journalist Inquiry Center She filed an application to the court after Azerbaijans Justice Ministry refused to grant her group state registration Nasibova turned to the Strasbourgbased court after a protracted and fruitless legal battle in her own country It was more difficult for me to get a no from Azerbaijani courts than a yes from the European Court of Human Rights she told RFERLs Azerbaijani Service Cases drag on forever in Azerbaijani courts In the end I was able to appeal to the European CourtThe European Court of Human Rights on October 18 unanimously ruled that Azerbaijani authorities had violated Nasibovas right to a fair trial and to freedom of associationThe court ordered the government to award her 4260 in damages But like most plaintiffs Nasibova says money matters less than moral reparationThe European Court is also taking on an increasing number of complaints from Armenia This year it passed its firstever ruling against the Armenian government condemning it for arresting opposition politician Armen Mkrtchyan during a street protestOne of the pending cases was filed by Armenias A1 Plus television channel which was pulled off the air in April 2002 after losing its broadcasting frequency in a tender organized by a presidentappointed bodyA1 Plus says it has filed a dozen applications for a new broadcasting license to the National Commission on Television and Radio All have been rejectedWe complained about two violations  one concerning human rights the other freedom of speech says Mesrop Movsisian the owner of the company that founded A1 Plus Now we are waiting for the courts decision We are very eager to be back on the air because we feel theres an information vacuumThe Council of Europe and international rights groups have criticized Armenian authorities for closing the channelThis year saw a raft of Strasbourg court rulings holding Russia responsible for atrocities committed by federal troops in ChechnyaSetting A PrecedentOne of the Chechen plaintiffs to recently win a case was Marzet Imakayeva a woman whose 25yearold son and husband disappeared after being detained by Russian forces in 2000 and 2002 respectively I thought that applying to the Strasbourg court could help me find my son she told RFERLs North Caucasus Service I thought that maybe he would be given back to me in order to avoid a court case I told them that no money in the world would compensate for my son that I would lodge an application in the hope that they return him to avoid a precedent Thats how I prepared the documents and sent them to the courtImakayeva said an official came to her home and threatened her with dire consequences if she didnt withdraw her complaint The court ordered Russia to pay 128000 to Imakayeva who has since emigrated to the United States Both her son and husband are still missing and are feared deadIn July the court held Russia responsible for the death of 11 civilians killed in the Grozny suburb of Novye Aldy during a Russian military operation in 2000 The raid killed at least 60 people The court awarded damages to relatives of two other civilians killed by Russian forces the same year in the Chechen village of Gekhi In total Russia was ordered to pay more than 350000 in compensationFurther articles in this series Judicial Reform Under Way But For The Right Reasons and

https://www.rferl.org/a/1078914.html,East Making Sense Of PostSoviet Alphabet Soup ,"October 10, 2007 13:58 GMT",,GUAM which groups Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan and Moldova is just one of the myriad alliances that arose from the ashes of the Soviet Union and are now vying for control of the region The GUAM youth summit comes just days after a gathering in the Tajik capital Dushanbe of officials from the 12 former Soviet republics that form the Commonwealth of Independent States or CIS The CIS summit featured sideline meetings between additional regional groupings The sixmember Eurasian Economic Community or Eurasec held talks The Collective Security Treaty Organization or CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization or SCO signed an important agreement to pool resources Alphabet SoupThe dizzying assortment of regional alliances  together with their perplexing acronyms  is one of the legacies of the collapse of the Soviet Union Some of these groupings like the CIS followed in the immediate wake of the USSR others in the late 1990s Some are concerned with security and defense while others focus mainly on economic developmentOnly close observers are likely able to recite the membership and official aims of all of the groups But Alexandre Rondeli the head of the Georgian Foundation for Strategy and International Studies in Tbilisi makes it simple All of these organizations he says can be roughly split into two campsAny alliance or organization that doesnt include Russia or that isnt dominated by Russia is considered an enemy hostile by Moscow  analyst Alexandre RondeliSome countries try to defend themselves and form alliances to counter Russian threats and even Russian economic pressure Rondeli says Other alliances and groups are created by Russia or Russias close allies to restore a postimperial space under Russian dominationUnder that model GUAM  which stands for the name of its four members Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan Moldova  would fall into the first category Although its leaders insist the group is not directed against any other state the westwardleaning ambitions evident in varying degrees in its members have contributed to its reputation as an antiMoscow alliance Lately GUAM has focused on extending an oil pipeline from Brody in Ukraine to the Polish city of Gdansk which would enable Azerbaijan to pump oil directly to Western Europe bypassing RussiaThe leaders of Azerbaijan Ukraine Georgia Poland and Lithuania are expected to discuss the project today at an energy summit in the Lithuanian Baltic Sea town of KlaipedaAlso high on GUAMs agenda are plans to create a multinational peacekeeping force that would replace the Russian contingent currently deployed in the Moscowbacked separatist regions of Transdniester in Moldova and of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in GeorgiaAntiRussianExpectedly Russian officials have consistently accused the alliance of being antiRussian and denounced it as an instrument used by the United States a GUAM sponsor and other Western nations to try to undermine Russias clout in the regionThe geopolitical context of this organization is definitely antiRussian says Konstantin Zatulin the head of the CIS Institute in Moscow and a State Duma deputy for the countrys Unified Russia ruling party Some are making use of the unfulfilled ambitions or internal problems of certain countries which for a number of reasons do not or cannot work with Russia like others The West needs this organization to compensate for Russias influence and revival to contain itOthers like Rondeli in Tbilisi say Moscow is simply riled by the efforts of GUAM member states to break out of Moscows orbitRussia has always seen GUAM as a menace Rondeli says Any alliance or organization that doesnt include Russia or that isnt dominated by Russia is considered an enemy hostile Russia is trying to destroy it by influencing certain countries for example former GUAM member Uzbekistan and MoldovaThe proWestern presidents of Ukraine and Georgia Viktor Yushchenko and Mikheil Saakashvili both swept to power after mass protests that toppled Moscowfriendly regimes Both are at loggerheads with the KremlinWhile Moldova also leans increasingly westward Azerbaijan has retained a more conciliatory position avoiding confrontation with MoscowAll four heads of state have called for increased cooperation between GUAM and NATO and the European UnionYushchenkos rise to the presidency has also poured cold water on Moscows hopes of creating a common economic space comprising Russia Ukraine Belarus and KazakhstanInstead Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week during the Dushanbe CIS summit that Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan will launch a customs union in 2011 within the framework of Eurasec He said the union may later grow to embrace the three other Eurasec members  Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan and UzbekistanThree of the four GUAM members  Ukraine Georgia and Moldova  have meanwhile threatened to desert the CIS altogether Many Commonwealth member states have aired frustration with what is seen as Moscows domineering role in the group A number of policy watchers have seen the deepening rifts within the CIS as signs heralding its disintegrationBut Alexander Rahr a CIS expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations says shifting alliances are only natural in the context of transition  The SCO groups Russia and China with Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan official siteOne thing has changed In the 1990s postSoviet countries were poor they were dependent on the West or on Asia for resources Today the situation has dramatically changed Rahr says These countries have reached unexpectedly high levels of economic growth so they will develop their own interests in each other their own way of building the future togetherRahr nonetheless upholds the view that shifts within the CIS are crystallizing into two camps with GUAM countries increasingly setting their sights on the West The result he says is that Russia is rallying allies in the EastRussia has understood that it has no future building a new reintegration model with countries like Ukraine or Georgia which are heading westward he says So Moscow is moving toward the east toward the Central Asian states which are eager to have some kind of alliance with Russia I think the idea of a gas cartel that would include this regions energyrich countries is something that Moscow is envisaging for itself in the near futureStill there are other regional groupings that bring Moscow and some of its dissenters to the table The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group or BSEC brings together 12 countries including Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia Moldova Russia and Ukraine with the expressed aim of fostering stability and integration

Oskanian admitted that there are outstanding issues in the countries relations but said that none should stand in the way of dialogueArmenia and Turkey continue to disagree over the status of NagornoKarabakh the disputed ethnicArmenian region in Azerbaijan and are clearly at odds over the interpretation of the mass killings of Armenians that took place in Ottoman Turkey between 191518Oskanians comments mirror those he made last week in New York where he attended the 62nd session of UN General Assembly and met with his Turkish counterpart Ali Babacan They also come as a US Congressional committee prepares to consider on October 10 a draft resolution that would define the World War Iera killings as genocideOskanian appealed to the European Parliaments Foreign Affairs Committee to put more pressure on Turkey to open a dialogue with Armenia He said landlocked Armenia is particularly keen to see Turkey lift the border blockade it imposed against Armenia in the early 1990sThe border opening is not only important for Armenia but its also important for the European Union because Turkey is the natural bridge between the Caucasus and Europe and the European Union Oskanian said Without Turkeys equitable and evenhanded policy visavis our region our relationship is not as effective as it could have been under conditions of normal ties between Turkey and ArmeniaAn Urgent IssueOskanians call was met with some sympathy among the European deputies in attendance The chairwoman of the European Parliaments delegation for the South Caucasus Marie Anne IslerBeguin said the bloc was not putting enough pressure on Turkey during EUaccession talksIslerBeguin said opening the border would greatly benefit both sides An impact study on the effects of the border closure on both Armenia and Turkey found that it is really urgent to open the border for the good of the populations on both sides she said The European Parliament is scheduled to hold a hearing on the issue in early November during which the study will be made public Oskanian criticized the EU for its neutrality on the issue an attitude he said was understandable but misplacedHe claimed that while Armenia has no preconditions to pursue closer links between the two countries Turkey does He dismissed Ankaras concern that Armenia harbors territorial claims against it saying the border between the two countries is clearly marked and conforms to the boundary set out in a 1922 treaty between Turkey and the Soviet UnionOskanian also said Armenias conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnicArmenian region of NagornoKarabakh does not involve Turkey and should not be raised by Ankara in a bilateral contextHe also rejected a call by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to set up a commission to study the events of 191518 He said talks on the issue remain impossible as long as Turkeys penal code continues to criminalize any depiction of the mass killings as genocide Oskanian also said dialogue was impossible as long as the border between the two countries is closed Balancing Between East And WestArmenias difficulties with Turkey undermine much of the countrys policy of complementarity its balancing act in relation to its neighbors and global players with an interest in the regionOskanian explained the policy as a refusal to choose between East and West in other countries disputes and conflicts and to remain considerate to everyones interestsFor countries like Armenia there is no reason to choose between one side and another We will benefit from all the opportunities that are available from all sides in security terms energy terms economic and otherwise so that we augment the end product as much as we can Oskanian saidOskanian defended Armenias heavy reliance on Russia in security and energy issues saying both were necessitated by blockades imposed by neighborsHe also described as absolutely inappropriate Azerbaijans attempts to discuss NagornoKarabakh at the United Nations He said Armenia believes the OSCE Minsk Group remains the only appropriate venue for talks on the frozen conflict Oskanian said the OSCE talks have revealed serious prospects of resolution noting that only four issues remain from a threepage document addressing the basic principles of resolving the conflict Oskanian said that so far the two countries leaders have been unable to come to a consensus on the four issues but expressed hope that the differences could be overcome before Armenias presidential elections in February 2008South

https://www.rferl.org/a/1078864.html,CIS Real Action At Summit Likely To Be On Sidelines ,"October 04, 2007 13:44 GMT",,In a statement released last week the Russian Foreign Ministry said that in addition to the 20 items on the agenda CIS officials will also discuss a proposal to reform the organization But analysts say they do not expect any consequential decisions to come out of the summit This is because the CIS has become an increasingly less cohesive organization in the 15 years since it emerged from the breakup of the Soviet UnionI think the main action will be in bilateral meetings says Fyodor Lukyanov editor in chief of the journal Russia In Global Affairs This is connected to the fact that the CISs general function has changed It is no longer a format to make decisions but rather a platform to conduct negotiationsEnergy Likely To DominateGhodratollah Shahidi director of RFERLs Tajik Service is in Dushanbe covering the summit Shahidi explains that one of the key items on the informal agenda will be energy as is often the case when Russia meets with its former Soviet neighborsRussia has been pushing very hard to sign bilateral contracts and agreements with several countries in the region Shahidi saysIn what analysts describe as a key meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to get together with Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov to discuss the transport of natural gas Russia has controlled Turkmen naturalgas exports since the Soviet breakup because the only pipelines exporting gas out of the country  other than a small pipeline to Iran  pass through RussiaTurkmenistan has strongly signaled to the West that it is interested in different gas routes For Russia this is a question of principle If the European Union and the United States manage to break up Gazproms monopoly on the Eurasian territory then everything changes  Fyodor Lukyanov Russia in Global AffairsIn May Putin Berdymukhammedov and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev agreed to build a pipeline along the Caspian Sea coast to transport natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe via Kazakhstan and Russia But the United States has been pressing Berdymukhammedov to participate in a project to build pipelines under the Caspian Sea that would bypass Russia and deliver Turkmen gas to Europe via TurkeyBreaking Gazproms MonopolyBerdymukhammedov has expressed an interest in joining these projects Such a move would diminish Moscows dominance of the regions energy markets  and its geopolitical influence Lukyanov saysTurkmenistan has strongly signaled to the West that it is interested in different gas routes he says For Russia this is a question of principle If the European Union and the United States manage to break up Gazproms monopoly on the Eurasian territory then everything changesBerdymukhammedov was in the United States in September and is due to meet EU officials in Brussels this month Lukyanov adds that Putin is keen to get Turkmenistans confirmation of the project Berdymukhammedov agreed to in May and keep the country in Moscows sphere of influenceThe Turkmen president has demonstrated that he is not in Putins pocket He was just in America He is going to Brussels in October This game around Turkmenistan will continue and unfold Lukyanov saysAnother issue looming over the CIS summit is who will be the organizations new executive secretary In June Moscow floated the name of Aleksandr Veshnyakov the former head of the Russian Central Election Commission But in a clear snub to Moscow Belarus made it clear that it would not support him and Russia withdrew his name from considerationThe outgoing executive secretary Vladimir Rushailo whose term ended on June 14 is still the acting CIS head Lukyanov said it is unclear whether Rushailo will stay in office or whether Russia will try to submit Veshnyakovs name againAt the last summit Belarus refused to support Veshnyakov and that was all Rushailo is the acting executive secretary until now even though his term ended long ago he says It will be interesting to see if there will be some kind of agreement or if Russia puts forward another candidateBreaking Free Of MoscowRussias difficulties with Belarus over the CIS executive secretary and with Turkmenistan over gas are indicative of a larger trend in the organization as more and more former Soviet states seek to break free of Moscows sphere of influenceThere are several members of the CIS who are now more favorable to the West than to Russia says Shahidi And this has created problems as before that they cannot reach agreement on some major issuesThe CIS comprises Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Georgia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Moldova Russia Tajikistan Ukraine and Uzbekistan Turkmenistan is an associate memberGeorgia has made joining NATO and the European Union a cornerstone of its policy Azerbaijan is seeking closer ties with the United States and Europe And Ukraines proWestern President Viktor

October 2 that although Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan share history they lack a common identity Soviet attempts to impose unity failed Semneby says and now the three countries are each in the grip of oldfashioned ethnically exclusive nationalismSemneby said Europe could help remedy this situationGiven the rivalries between and inside the countries this identity has to be larger than the region itself he said An additional layer of identity a European identity is what comes to mind here For such an identity or for such a layer of identity to work as a catalyst for bringing this broken region together again the countries and the communities in the region need however to understand that this identity is based on much more than just interests but is fundamentally based on common valuesYet the EU envoy was equally candid in making it plain that the EU at this point has little new to offer Georgia Both Ambitious VulnerableSemneby identified Georgia as the most advanced country in the region and the most ambitious in its drive to move closer to the EU and NATO However he also characterized Georgia as being the most vulnerable  largely due to the impact outside players such as Russia can have on its domestic affairsI would mention as a particular regional concern the rising tensions in GeorgianRussian relations which is illustrated for example by the continuing Russian sanctions against Georgia and the increasing number of security incidents in and around the conflict zones in Abkhazia and South Ossetia he saidGiven the rivalries between and inside the countries of the South Caucasus this identity has to be larger than the region itself An additional layer of identity a European identity is what comes to mind here  Peter Semneby EU special representativeSemneby said there has been no progress in resolving the frozen conflicts in Georgias breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia Upcoming elections in Russia as well as talks on the future status of another frozen conflict Kosovo are contributing to what Semneby describes as nervousness in the region He also poured cold water on Georgias attempts to sideline the separatist government in South Ossetia by setting up a rival proTbilisi administration Semneby said the EU will continue working with the de facto government in Tsinkhvali as it is key to addressing the problem which needs to be resolved though it does recognize that there are parallel authorities in the regionThe Georgian government is also not likely to be pleased by Semnebys observations that the EU will not send peacekeepers to Georgia without the consent of all involved parties or join the Georgian governments new Commission on the Staus of South Ossetia He also failed to say when the EU might relax its visa requirements for Georgian citizens to match the concessions already made for Russia  and enjoyed by the huge number of Russian passport holders in South Ossetia and AbkhaziaSemneby listed a number of recent EU confidencebuilding measures in Georgia but acknowledged that the blocs involvement in what are mostly training and liaison missions constitutes a rather modest effort in the security sectorNagornoKarabakh Situation FragileAddressing Armenia and Azerbaijan Semneby noted their continued dispute over the unrecognized republic of NagornoKarabakh He said the stalemate remains fragile and that the situation could deteriorate in the runup to elections in each of the two countries in 2008Semneby said the mediation efforts pursued by the OSCE Minsk Group in the region will intensify in the near future adding that the EU will fully support them As in Georgia he said the EU will focus on confidencebuilding measures among which he identified the promotion of peopletopeople contacts to help minimize the isolation of those living in the conflict zonesThe EU special representative said little on Armenia aside from noting that the countrys parliamentary elections in May were an improvement over previous polls But he sounded a warning for Azerbaijan Semneby said the EUs interest in Azerbaijans energy resources and transit potential will not cause the bloc to turn a blind eye to its deteriorating rights standardsAt the same time we cannot close our eyes to other parts of the EU agenda  the need to implement democratic reforms to respect human rights and freedom of the media and so on he said I mentioned earlier some of the problems we had with Azerbaijan in this context I think its important that everyone realizes that if these issues are also not taken seriously in the relationship with the EU this relationship will sooner or later run into trouble and the interestbased part of the relationship will also suffer as a resultOnce again revisiting the regions frozen conflicts Semneby noted Russias role in negotiations saying Moscow will remain a key actor in efforts to resolve the disputes and noting the EUs common interest in seeing such a conclusionSouth

https://www.rferl.org/a/1078774.html,Armenia Former President Lambastes Criminal Regime ,"September 24, 2007 14:01 GMT",,September 24 2007 RFERL  Speaking in Yerevan on the 16th anniversary of Armenias 1991 declaration of secession Levon TerPetrossian singled out President Robert Kocharian one of the key figures behind TerPetrossians forced resignation as president in February 1998 In his first major address for nine years TerPetrossian on September 21 accused Kocharian of presiding over a criminal regime that has turned Armenia into a thirdworld country and jeopardized all chance of achieving a settlement of the Karabakh conflict on terms acceptable to Armenia At the same time TerPetrossian said he has not yet decided whether to run in the presidential elections due in early 2008 in which Kocharian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term   Denouncing the current leadership as an institutionalized mafiastyle regime that has plunged us into the ranks of thirdworld counties TerPetrossian argued that regime change is a fundamental national priority given that survival of this government gives us no chance of ever getting out of this situation RFERLs Armenian Service reported But he conceded that the only way to get rid of these authorities is the consolidation of all sound political public intellectual and spiritual forces around a single presidential candidateSingle Opposition CandidateArmenian opposition parties have for weeks been debating the possibility of aligning behind a single candidate to challenge Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian whom Kocharian was quoted as endorsing on September 14 as the only politician in Armenia with the necessary experience and professional qualities to succeed him But until now few observers have rated TerPetrossians chances of being selected as that single opposition candidate very high Moreover Vazgen Manukian the veteran oppositionist who served under TerPetrossian in the early 1990s first as prime minister and then as defense minister told journalists in Yerevan on September 5 that even assuming TerPetrossian decides to run in 2008 which Manukian considered unlikely he would not withdraw his own candidacy in favor of the former president In the 1996 presidential election several opposition candidates pulled out at the last minute to back Manukian against TerPetrossian who was proclaimed the victor with 52 percent of the vote compared to 41 percent for Manukian In an interview with state television two years later one of TerPetrossians chief henchmen former Interior Minister Vano Siradeghian admitted that the results of the 1996 presidential vote were rigged to preclude a second round runoff between TerPetrossian and ManukianIn addition the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD which is an associate member of the coalition government has announced its firm intention of fielding its own presidential candidate in 2008 rather than backing Prime Minister Sarkisian even though its recent congress in NagornoKarabakh failed to yield agreement on who that candidate should be  parliament Deputy Speaker Vahan Hovannisian or parliament foreignaffairs committee Chairman Armen RustamianIn the event of a second runoff between Sarkisian and TerPetrossian however the HHD would throw its weight behind Sarkisian Aside from their ideological differences the HHD has a personal score to settle with TerPetrossian who in late December 1994 declared the party illegal and in July 1995 ordered the arrest of 31 of its activists including both Hovannisian and Rustamian on charges of terrorism and plotting to overthrow the countrys leadership Two years later the Supreme Court sentenced Hovannisian to four and Rustamian to three years imprisonment One of Kocharians first moves after becoming acting president in February 1998 was to relegalize the HHD and order the release from jail of Hovannisian whom he subsequently named as one of his aidesHovannisian on September 24 hit back at TerPetrossian who he said has no moral right to criticize the Kocharian leadership given that his eightyear tenure as president was marred by fraudulent elections humanrights violations and other abuses He said the vicious phenomena that still persist in Armenia have their roots in the TerPetrossian era Hovannisian said the HHD would welcome TerPetrossians participation in next years presidential ballot as it would add an ideological element to the race But he predicted that TerPetrossian will ultimately decide against running as his chances of winning are minimal and he doesnt like losingAccusations Over KarabakhIn his address on September 21 TerPetrossian described as the greatest crime committed by Kocharian and Sarkisian their failure to agree to a solution to the Karabakh conflict In the fall of 1997 TerPetrossian published a seminal article entitled War And Peace Time For Serious Thought in which he argued that resolving the Karabakh conflict rather than preserving the status quo was in the interests of both Armenia and the unrecognized republic of NagornoKarabakh NKR in order to remove obstacles to economic development and unspecified problems in Armenias relations with other countries that the conflict should be resolved peacefully rather than militarily and that the eventual settlement should constitute a compromise in which neither side would emerge as either the winner or the loser TerPetrossian stressed that compromise is not a choice between the good and the bad but rather between the bad and the even worse And he went on to warn that The opposition should not mislead the people by arguing that there is an alternative to compromise the alternative to compromise is war In War And Peace TerPetrossian also addressed anew the question of the relative merits of the socalled phased and package approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict noting that since both Azerbaijan and the NKR leadership had rejected two successive draft peace plans proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group that were based on the package approach it made sense for Armenia to accept as a basis for negotiation the subsequent September 1997 Minsk Group phased blueprint even though he considered its terms far from ideal  This is Kocharians last term allowed under the constitution AFPIt has long been accepted as conventional wisdom that TerPetrossians endorsement of the September 1997 phased peace plan was the primary if not the sole reason why several of his ministers including Kocharian and Sarkisian  then premier and interior minister respectively  launched the campaign that culminated in his forced resignation in February 1998 But as TerPetrossians former adviser Gerard Libaridian points out in his book The Challenges of Statehood TerPetrossian had argued earlier in favor of a compromise solution to the conflict and the ministers in question had not previously taken issue with that argument Libaridian also affirmed that the disagreement between TerPetrossian and the triumvirate that sought to oust him did not center on the relative merits of the phased vs the package approaches to resolving the conflict TerPetrossian argued on September 21 that Azerbaijan is now less and less prepared to make concessions to the Armenian side because of its mounting oil revenues From now on they will not agree to any concessions I dont know what needs to be done to get out of this situation he said TerPetrossian embarked in early August on a series of meetings with supporters and HHSh sympathizers across Armenia and the HHSh subsequently announced its intention of nominating him as its presidential candidate But that party is widely perceived as compromised and enjoying only minimal support The radical Hanrapetutiun Republic opposition party headed by former Prime Minister Aram Sargsian likewise backs TerPetrossian as do a couple of small HHSh splinter groups including Aylentrank Alternative An opinion poll conducted in July found that if presidential elections were held then only some 17 percent of the 1200 respondents would have voted for TerPetrossian Presumably precisely because the degree of popular support he could count on remains unclear TerPetrossian declined on September 21 to say whether he will in fact participate in the 2008 ballot I have not made a decision yet I am still examining weighing up considering things My approach is purely political I cant be guided by emotions Adventurism is alien to my character RFERLs Armenian Service quoted him as

there was another clear signal all European Neighborhood Policy ENP members are to be treated the same,And for those countries that might have fancied their membership chances there was another clear signal all European Neighborhood Policy ENP members are to be treated the sameA highlevel conference on the EUs Neighborhood Policy opened in Brussels today bringing together ministers and senior officials from all 27 EU member states and the 16 ENP countries and marking a revival in EU interest in its eastern and Mediterranean neighborsIn the morning country representatives took to the floor in no set geographical order In the afternoon workshops on themes like Connecting Neighbors and Governance and Stability were styled to apply equally to allThis drive to display uniformity hides a key rift among the neighbors as well as the EU member states It papers over differences between the southern Mediterranean countries whove been disqualified from EU membership and eastern exSoviet states most of whom still aspire to join the blocHowever those membership aspirations may not be enoughAll Neighbors EqualA key component of the opening speech of the conference made by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso was a rejection of regional differentiationBy focusing attention on the wider European and Mediterranean area the ENP has leveraged more support from the European Unions member states than if we looked at each of our neighbors in isolation  BarrosoBy focusing attention on the wider European and Mediterranean area the ENP has leveraged more support from the European Unions member states than if we looked at each of our neighbors in isolation Barroso saidAnd that was the first goal of our policy  in order to leverage more support to attract more attention to focus also more resources he added Political resources but also financial resources  lets be frank about thatBarroso explained that without regional distinctions the ENP remains free from the vagaries of the special interests of different EU members as they rotate the blocs presidency among themThe evolving consensus within the EU is clearly skewed against further accessions partly as a result of previous enlargementsCorrespondingly the EU is now putting less emphasis on political reforms and rights standards which are crucial for candidate countries Political standards were not raised by any of the EU headline speakers todayEconomic FocusInstead the EU is keen to capitalize on practical matters of mutual interest Its current priorities for cooperation with the neighbors are economic integration energy cooperation increased travel and work opportunities and increased financial and technical assistanceEU External Relations Commissioner Benita FerreroWaldner underlined the blocs economic ambitions Our vision is of an economically integrated area which spans the whole of the European Union and its closest European and Mediterranean partners she said An area where goods services and capital move freelyWith the EU as the worlds largest importer of natural gas and oil a key part of this vision is energy cooperationBoth Barroso and FerreroWaldner highlighted energy agreements already reached with Ukraine and Azerbaijan and about to be concluded with Algeria and EgyptUkraine Moldova DisappointedBut not all the neighbors are happy with the way things are going Ukraine conspicuously failed to dispatch its foreign minister to the conference only being represented by its EU ambassador Roman Shpek   Commissioner FerreroWaldner speaking in Brussels today official siteEU officials downplayed the slight attributing it to Ukraines upcoming parliamentary elections but the blocs diplomats privately acknowledge its significance Ukraine has repeatedly made it clear that it only participates in the ENP reluctantly and does not consider it an appropriate framework for its relations with the EU  as it believes it is a European country and not a neighborUkraines sentiments are to a degree shared by neighboring Moldova The countrys foreign minister Andrei Stratan today openly criticized the blocs limited ambitionsThe proposals presented by the European Commission in its report in December 2006 on strengthening the ENP is already a big step forward but one which still does not meet our expectations he said We consider that the basis for a solid relationship between the EU and Moldova  taking into account its unequivocal European integration objective  could be acceptance in the EUs four freedoms Stratan addedStratan is specifically referring here to the EUs fourth freedom  that provides for the free movement of people The first three apply to the movement of capital services and goods and are part of the current ENP offerEach Neighbor DifferentBelarus remains outside the bounds of the ENP as long as its authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka shuns democratic reforms The country was represented at the conference by a senior civil servant as an observerOf the other eastern neighbors Georgia chose to focus on its strive to get the EU to ease its visa restrictions Currently due to an EURussian visafacilitation deal already in force Russian passport holders in separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia enjoy easier access to the EU than GeorgiansArmenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian expressed full satisfaction with the present course of the ENP His Azerbaijani colleague Elmar Mammadyarov said he is also content to work within the ENP framework highlighting Bakus interest in energy cooperation Mammadyarov was the only speaker in the morning session to draw attention to rights standards saying European cooperation required adherence to European standards and condemned unspecified instances of occupation and ethnic cleansingThe ENP is composed of Algeria Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Egypt Georgia Israel Jordan Lebanon Libya Moldova Morocco the Palestinian Authority Syria Tunisia and UkraineThe EU And Its NeighborsGOOD NEIGHBORS BUT BEST AT ARMS LENGTHBy Ahto LobjakasAt long last its neighborhood is coming back into focus for the European Union But the constitutional crisis provoked by the enlargement of 2004 and now seemingly resolved has left the EU a different place  and consequently the neighborhood too The firstever allEU and allneighborhood conference in Brussels on September 3 bore eloquent witness to thisBefore 2004 the predominant view of the incipient European Neighborhood Policy ENP was to see it as an extension of enlargement inspired by it and possibly leading to another wave of accessions in an admittedly faroff future Unveiling the first ENP blueprint thenEuropean Commission President Romano Prodi said that the offer to the neighbors would extend to everything but participation in EU institutionsLast week the EUs external relations commissioner Benita FerreroWaldner told RFERL that view had been too simplistic Pragmatic economic integration she said has turned out to be much more essential than grand political vistasThe EU now abhors any reference to enlargement in the same breath with the prospects of the neighborhood Officially the ENP takes no stand on the issue of accession prospects But the reality of the EUs focus increasingly belies that interpretationNowhere is this clearer than the increasing lumping of all the 16 neighbors together and preventing any regional differentiation This has been one of the key messages of the Brussels conference which contained no regional workshops or speaker listsAt one level the rationale for this appears perfectly plausible Differentiation would only provoke an unseemly scramble among the neighbors for patronage and money It would also pit the special interests of the different EU member states against one another warned European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on September 3But the scramble for the money has already taken place  and was resolved in the favor of the Mediterranean neighbors In 200713 they get nearly twothirds of the 12 billion euros 16 billion available for the neighborhoodMore importantly from an eastern perspective identification with the south automatically undermines the membership credentials of such hopefuls in the east as Ukraine Moldova and Georgia The Mediterranean countries were to all practical intents and purposes disqualified from EU membership when Moroccos 1987 application was rejected by the bloc on the grounds that the country is not EuropeanRegional differentiation could offer the eastern neighbors some comfort but the larger truth is that todays onesizefitsall approach accurately mirrors the weight of the consensus among the 27 member states Further enlargement is anathema for their publics and cannot therefore be pursuedThis has translated itself into a transformation of priorities The emphasis on common values democratic reforms and humanrights standards has given way to a focus on pragmatic cooperation The bargain is no longer trade and access from the EU for reforms from the neighbors as before 2004 but EU trade and visa concessions for neighborhood energy and legislative adaptations to ease economic cooperationIn reality the eastern neighbors have their patrons in the EU just as the Mediterranean countries do But the patrons of the east are currently on the losing side their credibility tainted by the fact that most of them are part of the 2004 intake themselves Their natural leader Poland has frittered away most of its influence in internal EU squabbles with GermanyAnd then there is of

this hurt relations between Iran and AzerbaijanNasir Hamidi Zare Neither Azerbaijans relations with other countries nor our relations with other countries limit our bilateral ties During past meetings

Ahmadinejad has said we are open to bigger and better relations with AzerbaijanRFERL Will Irans recent difficulties with the international community be discussed during Ahmadinejads visit to BakuZare This trip is meant to discuss issues of mutual cooperation Other issues of course will be discussed as well Presidents never limit the scope of their discussions to a narrow agenda But of course the most important issue in Baku will be improving bilateral relationsRFERL Can Azerbaijan serve as a mediator in helping to improve relations between the United States and IranZare When our president traveled to the United States in September 2005 he said he was ready for dialogue But if one side doesnt want to change its position what can Azerbaijan do about it Despite all the scandalous reports you see in the newspapers and on television we hear that the American people and the highest levels of American government want to have sincere and close relations with Iran If you put all the bad press aside you see that there are logical people in every country Of course policies are decided by governments but nothing can stop people from having good relationsRFERL How do you view the US role

policy that we support Azerbaijans territorial integrity and will continue to do so Azerbaijan is a neighbor and a Muslim state and of course this relationship is more important for us than our

personal opinion but it also reflects the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran This occupation should be condemnedRFERL Are you concerned by talks on whether the United States will use the Qabala radar station in Azerbaijan as part of its missiledefense shield Will this issue be discussed during Ahmadinejads visitZare The Azerbaijani people and the Azerbaijani government should be more concerned about this issue than we are Russia and the United States act like the state of Azerbaijan doesnt even exist when they negotiate on the issue But when you take Azerbaijans sovereignty and independence into account you have to look at this policy from a different point of view You know that and we know that Our history has been marked by many events that Im not going to discuss now But were watching talks on Qabala very carefully and sensitively Because we see peace and stability in Azerbaijan as peace and stability in Iran And if others would like to play games in the name of security neither the state of Azerbaijan nor its people will accept it The question is being discussed between two countries Russia and the United States What aspect of the issue can we discuss here

Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Daniel Fried about the latest developments in Georgia and the hopes for peace in NagornoKarabakh They also discussed the results of the August 3 round of the USAzerbaijani dialogue on democracy and human rights,RFERL Azerbaijani Service acting Director Kenan Aliyev spoke to US Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Daniel Fried about the latest developments in Georgia and the hopes for peace in NagornoKarabakh They also discussed the results of the August 3 round of the USAzerbaijani dialogue on democracy and human rightsRFERL Are you concerned about the latest developments in Georgia What is the US position on this issue Daniel Fried We are very concerned In fact we condemned we condemn this attack We have been in close touch with the Georgian government which has shown us the evidence it has The evidence seems to show that there was an overflight an incursion We at the same time urge both Georgia and Russia to continue to work together cooperatively to resolve issues related to South Ossetia and Abkhazia We think that it would be a terrible mistake if this latest incident as bad as it is derailed some of the progress that has been made and we hope both sides continue to work together I should also add that weve been in touch with the Russian government both in Washington and Moscow and were aware that the Russian government has denied any involvement in these attacks Weve also been assured that the Russian government wants to work with Georgia in a constructive spirit and we hope that now the way forward is for Russia and Georgia to cooperate both on South Ossetia and Abkhazia but also to cooperate in the Georgian investigation of this incident Were going to follow it closely were going to evaluate the information I must say there is absolutely no evidence that Ive seen that this is somehow a Georgian provocation This doesnt appear to be the case at all It was certainly a problem but not one of Georgias making So while were clear about the problem that exists we also want both sides to work together and the indications are that both the Georgian and Russian governments are going to continue to work together and if that is the case we welcome it RFERL And what is the status of the discussion of the radar station at Qabala in Azerbaijan Is this off the table Fried Were consulting with the Russians about this We thought Russian President Vladimir Putin made a very interesting offer We immediately made sure of course that the Azerbaijani government was comfortable with it Were not going to do something with Russia that involves anything on Azerbaijani territory without consulting the government of Azerbaijan It affects the sovereign territory of that country Its on the table we want to work with Russia we see the Russian offer as interesting and promising Its not a substitute for what we want to do with the Poles and Czechs but we see rather that all of these ideas  the American ideas with the Poles and the Czechs the Russian ideas with Qabala and their own radar installations in southern Russia European projects for short and midrange missile defense the best case would be for all of these proposals to be brought together in a large compatible system that provided everybody with the best possible protection RFERL With both Armenia and Azerbaijan entering their election cycles are you less optimistic about the chances for success in the NagornoKarabakh peace process and do you think that the presidents have missed an opportunityFried I dont want to be critical I think that we were all disappointed that the last trip of the Contact Group didnt yield the results we had hoped There have been good negotiations well good talks I should say some progress has been made and at some point I hope that the leaders of the two countries will find a way forward Ultimately its in everyones interests The future of Azerbaijan will be under a cloud as long as this issue is not resolved and it can only be resolved peacefully A war is going to destroy Azerbaijans future and do no one any good A peaceful settlement is the way to go Weve come this far and I hope that we can resolve itRFERL Can you tell us about the latest round of the USAzerbaijan democracy and humanrights dialogue What are your main concerns in terms of Azerbaijans democratic development Fried Step back a little bit Azerbaijan is emerging in two senses Its emerging from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and its also emerging in its own right as a nation and it takes both political will and time to build functioning democratic institutions So we want to be very clear about problems that exist  and there are problems in the media in particular  but we also want to work with Azerbaijan to build institutions to help Azerbaijan build the institutions of free media and the practice of free media and were going to tackle these issues one at a time RFERL Many critics of US policy in Azerbaijan point to the fact that the United States has strategic relations with Azerbaijan when it comes to security and energy But they say that the United States is not tough enough on the democracydevelopment issues in AzerbaijanFried Im aware of the charge but it just isnt true If we didnt care about democracy issues we wouldnt be having this dialogue The Azerbaijani authorities know very well that this is important to us and that progress in this area will mean that our relations are deeper and stronger Lack of progress means the problems will be a constant drag on our relations Obviously some of the NGOs and the humanrights organizations in Baku are principally concerned with the problems of democracy in that country and the shortcomings and I dont blame them We keep in good contact with them and we share some of their concerns but weve got to find the right way to pursue all of our interests at once and not allow our interests in security or economics to drown out our relations in greater freedom and at the same time not allow our interests and commitment to freedom paralyze us from cooperation in other areas Saying that is one thing doing it is another and we will do our best RFERL Can we expect that there will be any immediate results of this ongoing dialogue For example do you think the government will release the seven imprisoned journalists The US State Department the US government and international organizations have all raised this issue many times Fried They certainly should find a way to resolve this problem I cant promise you what the actions will be because the Azerbaijani government will make its determination and the processes there will work and hopefully there will be good results but I cant guarantee this What I can say though is that we will continue to raise these issues even when it is difficult for the Azerbaijani government to hear it We will continue to raise it But I also dont want to leave the impression that our discussions are confrontational They were not Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov knows Americans very well He knows our concerns he knows how serious we are about expressing them I think he approached this in good faith he listened carefully and we also had a discussion about areas where we can work together RFERL Youre in constant contact with the Azerbaijani authorities Do you have a sense that the Azerbaijani government is really committed to democratic reformFried I think that the government has a vision of a modernized wellrun country and I think that they are more inclined to work with us on projects of building institutions I think some of the problems exist with respect to individual cases and represent frankly the lack of such institutions Azerbaijan still needs to build a strong independent judiciary It needs to strengthen the rule of law it needs to strengthen sanctity of contracts it needs to build independent institutions of government which will be credible regulators of the economy So it has a lot to do I think that the Azerbaijani government is more inclined to build new institutions and I think that the problems arise when individual cases come up and are not handled well by the institutions that now exist Now thats a general view thats my observation I wouldnt argue that its accurate in all respects but its my effort to give a general picture of what we seeMissile Defense Not In My Backyard AN RFERL VIDEO PRESENTATION The Czech Republic responds to the US

arrive in NagornoKarabakh today to monitor the elections Azerbaijan has condemned the NagornoKarabakh elections as illegal and illegitimate  Azerbaijans position is firm and has not changed Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Khazar Ibrahim told RFERLs Azerbaijani Service this week These socalled elections are illegal with no legal effect At the same time any elections in the future can be just and legal only if they are conducted within the Constitution of Azerbaijan within the norms and principles of international law and with the inclusion of the Azerbaijani communityThese authorities are elected and that is better than not having anybody in power at all in NagornoKarabakh If there were not elections if there was anarchy there it would be worse  political commentator Abramian   The predominantly ethnicArmenian region of NagornoKarabakh lies within Azerbaijans borders Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war over the region from 1988 until a 1994 ceasefire was brokered The conflict has been frozen ever since and negotiations continue on its future status The Organization for Secuirty and Cooperation in Europe OSCE  like the rest of the international community  does not recognize NagornoKarabakh and therefore considers the elections to be illegitimate  Harri Kamarainen the head of the Caucasus Department at the OSCEs Conflict Prevention Center says that the issue of the elections has come up in discussions between Armenian and Azerbaijan  where it has proven to be an irritant  The fact that elections take place and the authorities in Karabakh organize these is somewhat of an irritating factor for the Azerbaijani side Kamarainen says NATO spokesman James Appathurai today said that the alliance like other international organizations will not recognize any polls held by the breakaway region Aram Abramian a political commentator and editor in chief of the Yerevanbased daily newspaper Aravot says however that the elections will have little effect on the peace process itself since authorities in NagornoKarabakh are not party to the negotiations  Under the current negotiating format he the NagornoKarabakh president will not participate Abramian says Everything depends on the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan Therefore at this stage in any case the role of the leadership in NagornoKarabakh is of secondary importance  Resolution Sought  On July 13 the French Russian and US cochairs of the OSCE Minsk Group which seeks to mediate a resolution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict called on Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to prepare for a new summit at the first opportunity  The two last met on the sidelines of an informal CIS summit in St Petersburg in June  Sahakians main challenger for the presidency is Deputy Foreign Minister Masis Maylian Other candidates include parliament deputy Armen Abgarian NagornoKarabakh Communist Party leader Hrant Melkumian and Vanya Avanesian a professor at Artsakh State University  Maylian has accused NagornoKarabakh authorities of favoring Sahakians candidacy over the others Incumbent Arkady Ghukasian cannot run in the election having served the maximum two terms Elections with predictable  or even preordained as some have alleged  results are commonplace in frozenconflict zones  In the past eight months three other breakaway regions in the former Soviet Union  South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia and Transdniester in Moldova  have held either parliamentary or presidential elections  And in each case there were no surprises Candidates or parties backed by the local separatist elite  and their patrons in Moscow  won by overwhelming margins  Abramian says the trend reflects a general pattern not just in conflict zones but in much of the former Soviet Union where manipulated elections increasingly serve as tool to legitimize the ruling political clan  It is completely clear who will win this election Abramian says I dont really like this Chekist eds former member of the Soviet KGB who will be the president But on the other hand this is not a problem only of NagornoKarabakh It is a reflection of all the regimes in the CIS including those that are internationally recognized  Frozen Status  Abramian added that the election will neither improve nor harm the situation in NagornoKarabakh  In NagornoKarabakh there needs to be some kind of authority Abramian notes This authority must either be elected appointed or inherited These authorities are elected and that is better than not having anybody in power at all in NagornoKarabakh If there were not elections if there was anarchy there it would be worse This way it wont be better and it wont be worse  Polls are due to be open on July 19 from 8 am to 8 pm local timeThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict zoneIn February 1988 the local assembly in Stepanakert the local capital of the Azerbaijani

against Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait In 199192 Azerbaijani forces launched an offensive against separatist forces in NagornoKarabakh but the Armenians counterattacked and by 199394 had

https://www.rferl.org/a/1077614.html,Russia Moscow Content To Block Kosovo Resolution ,"July 13, 2007 15:17 GMT",Russia on July 12 turned down a third draft resolution on Kosovo based on a plan submitted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari that provides a framework for independent statehood under the supervision of the European Union ,Russia on July 12 turned down a third draft resolution on Kosovo based on a plan submitted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari that provides a framework for independent statehood under the supervision of the European Union The latest version taking into account Russian objections to the previous proposals extends to four months the amount of time allocated for talks between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians on the future status of the province The proposal circulated at the UN by French and British delegates also reportedly contained a condition under which the Ahtisaari plan would no longer automatically go into effect if the two sides failed to reach an agreementNothing NewRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov addressing journalists on July 12 said the last document differed little from the previous versions aside from its wordingWe can only support a draft resolution that isacceptable to both sides Pristina and Belgrade So far we see no suchagreement  LavrovBehind the rather intricate diplomatic language of the draft resolution there is a conclusion that after 120 days whether or not the sides reach an agreement the Ahtisaari plan will come into effect he said And as you know we can only support a draft resolution that is acceptable to both sides Pristina and Belgrade So far we see no such agreement Essentially Lavrov made clear that there is little room for compromise on Russias part unless Serbia agrees to independence for Kosovo a development most pundits consider unrealistic In Belgrade Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica quickly rejected the new draft proposal and back in Moscow Konstantin Kosachyov the chairman of the State Dumas Foreign Affairs Committee said the situation In Kosovo does not require an immediate solutionNevertheless Lavrov assured journalists the problem of a decision on the independence of Kosovo has not been taken off the agendaExchanging PolemicsRegardless the latest Russian rejection has already led UN envoy Ahtisaari and Lavrov to engage in a new round of polemicsSpeaking in Helsinki Ahtisaari said Moscows reluctance to work out a compromise could further harm Russia image abroad Rather than strengthening its international position Russia only weakens it he said Lavrov however dismissed Ahtisaaris remark If he really said this I consider his statement to be inappropriate Maybe such a statement could reduce another countrys international status but not Russias Lavrov said on July 13 He added If in the course of considerations one of the parties cannot accept these proposals by Ahtisaari negotiations should continue and they should be assisted by an impartial international mediatorHardLine StanceLavrovs comments are in keeping with the position Russia has long held on the issue one that has led it to hint that it might veto the plan if it reaches the UN Security CouncilAs recently as July 9 Lavrov said that any solution not agreeable to both Serbia and Kosovo cannot make it through the Security Council Prior to that responding to recent comments by US officials Lavrov said in a June 26 interview with RTR that statements that that independence for Kosovo is inevitable do not convince us  Lavrov sees little need to compromise AFP file photoAlthough most pundits agree that Moscows veto threats are no bluff they differ in their interpretations of the Kremlins hardline stance When considering Moscows motivation for its position most cite Moscows desire to extract concessions on other issues to prevent a separatist trend within the Russian Federation and to defend the inviolability of countries territorial integrity Other analysts believe that Russia seeks to use the possibility of an independent Kosovo as leverage against neighboring states that seek closer ties with the WestPresident Vladimir Putin for instance has repeatedly said that an independent Kosovo could serve as a precedent for the frozen conflicts in Georgia whose proMoscow regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia seek independence and in Moldova whose proMoscow Transdniester region also wants statehoodPolitical HeadacheIn reality however Moscow is currently less fearful of seeing independence movements sparked within its ethnic republics such as Chechnya and does not really want to alter the status of breakaway republics in CIS states eitherIf for example the independence of Kosovo were declared a development that many consider inevitable Russia would logically have to keep promises it has already made to the leaders of the breakaway republics and recognize their independent status But in doing so for example regarding Abkhazia Russia would also be forced to define its position on the hotly contested region of NagornoKarabakh the source of a bitter armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 198894 But whatever decision Moscow makes on Karabakh whether it be recognition or ignorance of its independent status it can be assured of angering either Armenia or AzerbaijanRussia understandably would like to avoid such a political headache and will seek to preserve the status quo rather than risk taking a stance on the principle of selfdetermination as opposed to territorial integrityFixing Past MistakesThere is also another factor in Moscows persistence on the Kosovo issue It relates to Russias role in the Balkans in 1990s when the country under President Boris Yeltsin cooperated with NATO and the United States in trying to resolve the Yugoslav crisis At that time thenRussian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin flew to Belgrade to convince late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to deal with the West But in hindsight Moscow now looks upon its decision as an embarrassing example of weakness and concession and would like to make amendsAs Sergei Karaganov the head of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy and a political adviser to Putins administration noted in a commentary on kremlinorg on 16 June Many in Moscow now want American and European colleagues to pay the full price for their games in Kosovo although they do not want to admit it publicly In seeking to make up for its retreat from the Balkans in the past decade Moscow has located the weak link in the Wests position on Kosovo Russia realizes that any unilateral declaration of independence for Kosovo that does not follow UN procedure will not be recognized by all members of the European Union and could cause a rift within the blocRussia designed its strategy on Kosovo based on this calculationTired Of CooperationA good way of describing this strategy can be found in a recent comment by Aleksei Pushkov a proKremlin political analyst for NTV who said on his show Postkriptum on 7 July that Russia should not help the US and EU escape from the difficult situation in Kosovo He also listed reasons for testing the Wests mettle on KosovoFirst he said Russia has previously tried to cooperate with the United States and NATO  particularly in Afghanistan after September 11 2001  and has come away disappointed He said that if Russia does not get the concessions it seeks on Kosovo it will not see reciprocal steps toward us neither on the issue of US missiledefense elements in Europe nor on other issues on which we differSecond the situation over Kosovo belongs to a category of who will overplay whom The Western media writes about it in terms of the EU being hostage to the Russia position and that Russia should be not allowed to define EU foreign policy Pushkov said but this is the language of competition not cooperation Therefore if Russia were to alter its position on Kosovo toward compromise it would be perceived by the West not as act of partnership but as the defeat of a competitor who surrendered to pressurePushkovs third point was that Russias confrontation with the West on Kosovo is a matter of principleThe main criteria according to Pushkov is whether Russia will return to the international arena as an independent playerPutin wants to turn the Kosovo issue into a demonstration that Russia has regained its clout If we retreat we will once again we be considered to be feeble Pushkov wrote If we stand our claims to a role of significance will be justifiedIn the end even a brief analysis of Moscow publicopinion leaders statements on Kosovo shows that the Kremlin  due to its interpretations of the countrys ambitions and national interests  is not interested in a quick

https://www.rferl.org/a/1077613.html,NagornoKarabakh Who Will Be The Next President ,"July 13, 2007 14:31 GMT",,Of the five registered candidates the clear favorite is Bako Sahakian who resigned as National Security Service chairman to register for the ballot  Sahakian is backed by Ghukasians Democratic Artsakh Party ZhAK by the two opposition parties represented in the republican parliament and by the current Armenian leadership which implies that he is also considered acceptable by Moscow  Unfair SupportSahakians main challenger Deputy Foreign Minister Masis Maylian has accused the republican authorities of unfairly promoting Sahakians candidacy to the detriment of his rivals while a recent opinion poll indicated that 19 percent of respondents do not believe the upcoming ballot will be free and fair  The five candidates participating in the ballot are Sahakian who is 49 and made his career in the Sovietera Committee for State Security KGB Maylian who is in his late 30s and a graduate of the Vienna Diplomatic Academy parliament deputy Armen Abgarian NagornoKarabakh Communist Party leader Hrant Melkumian and Vanya Avanesian a professor at Artsakh State University  Ghukasian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive presidential term Ghukasians ZhAK signaled its support for Sahakians candidacy on April 20 the first day for nominating candidates Azat Hayrenik Free Fatherland the junior partner in the ruling coalition followed suit some 450 delegates to a party congress on May 28 unanimously affirmed their support for Sahakian regnumru reported  Two opposition parties likewise backed Sahakians candidacy the Movement88 and somewhat surprisingly the Karabakh chapter of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD which is aligned with the new Armenian coalition government  Many observers had anticipated that the HHD would support Maylian especially in light of a statement the party issued in April harshly criticizing the republican governments policies Sahakian himself told RFERLs Armenian Service on June 20 that he is proud that both progovernment and opposition forces support him and sees nothing illogical in that support  There appear to be few fundamental differences between the various candidates programs all acknowledge the need to improve rural infrastructure including roads irrigation systems and schools and to reduce unemployment and raise living standards  More ExpectedSahakian and Maylian both implied that they would expect greater commitment and honesty from government employees Maylian called for real reforms and outlined a tough stance for negotiations on ending the conflict with Azerbaijan  He argued specifically that negotiations between the NKR and Azerbaijan on delimiting borders can begin only after the unconditional recognition of the sovereignty and state independence of the NKR regnumru reported on July 2  He has also advocated settling Armenian families on the districts of Azerbaijan currently occupied by Armenian forces but it is not clear whether he unequivocally opposes the return of those territories to Azerbaijani control as part of a peace deal  Maylian also said that Armenia and NagornoKarabakh should have a single shared system of national security possibly implying a unified military command structure with Karabakh forces subordinate to the Armenian Defense Ministry in Yerevan President Kocharians adviser has told journalists that the election campaign in Karabakh is unique in the entire postSoviet space and he dismissed out of hand disparaging and unsavory rumors about SahakianBefore the election campaign formally got under way Karabakhbased independent analyst David Karabekian noted that the five candidates represent a broader spectrum of political and social interests than was the case in previous elections and he dismissed fears that the level of support expressed for Sahakian effectively rendered the outcome of the vote a foregone conclusion regnumru reported on May 16  And on July 10 Karabekian dismissed as primitive logic the supposition that the authorities in Armenia and NagornoKarabakh reached agreement that Sahakian should succeed Ghukasian as president and that Maylians role is little more than that of sparring partner  Just days after the formal start on June 20 of the election campaign Maylians campaign manager Sergei Kalantarian complained that an anchor on NKR state television was openly agitating in favor of Sahakian regnumru reported on June 25  A local government official in the northern Mardakert district was reportedly forced into early retirement on June 7 for openly saying he planned to vote for Maylian And in Yerevan Igor Muradian a veteran participant in the 1988 campaign to persuade the Soviet leadership to transfer Karabakh from Azerbaijani to Armenian jurisdiction alleged that outgoing President Ghukasian was orchestrating a proSahakian campaign pulling out all the stops to ensure he is elected  Ghukasian for his part has characterized the election campaign as close to ideal regnumru reported on July 3 while Central Election Commission Chairman Sergei Nasibian described it as proceeding normally  In Yerevan President Kocharians adviser Garnik Isagulian told journalists on July 10 that the election campaign in Karabakh is unique in the entire postSoviet space and he dismissed out of hand disparaging and unsavory rumors about Sahakian regnumru reported  Isagulian described Sahakians candidacy as acceptable for everyone and predicted that 80 percent of the electorate will vote for him By contrast a survey of 700 people conducted by the Sociometer center showed that 45 percent would vote for Sahakian and 5 percent for Mayilian Noyan Tapan reported on June 18 a second survey by the same pollster two weeks later showed support for the two men at 60 percent and maximum 10 percent respectively  Free And FairAddressing students in Yerevan on July 2 Ghukasian pledged to ensure that the July 19 vote is free and fair stressing that his republic always holds the best election in the postSoviet space even if the international community declines to recognize the vote as legal and valid RFERLs Armenian Service reported  Voters in Karabakh appear to think otherwise however according to a poll conducted in late June by the Independent Center for Humanitarian and Political Studies 19 percent of the respondents said they do not believe the July 19 election will be free and fair while a further 16 percent said they do not think their vote will change anything  Those perceptions are very probably based on the assumption that the preferences of the unrecognized republics voters take second place to the strategic plans of the Armenian and Russian leadershipsAs in the case of earlier presidential and parliamentary elections in NagornoKarabakh the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has denounced the planned vote as lacking legitimacy and aimed at concealing Armenias policy of annexation andstrengthening the ongoing occupation of Azerbaijani territoryNagornoKarabakhClick on the map to see an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict

of the OSCE Minsk Group that seeks to mediate between the conflict sides Moratinos declared that the parties today are close to a settlement and urged the two sides to take the important moment to achieve progress in the negotiations In the event however the threehour talks between Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the CIS summit in St Petersburg on June 9 failed to yield any progress toward overcoming the most serious remaining points of disagreement between the two sides And on June 20 the two sides implicitly blamed each other for that failureEven before the St Petersburg meeting the Minsk Group cochairmen switched tack and downplayed the remarks by Moratinos The US cochair Matthew Bryza said that while the extent of the remaining differences between the two sides is narrowing we cannot say that this time we expect a turning point in St Petersburg according to Noyan Tapan on June 7 Points Of ContentionTwo days earlier the Azerbaijani online daily zerkaloaz quoted Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov as saying that of the eight basic principles for resolving the conflict that are on the table and that were made public last year by the Minsk Group cochairs only one or two are still the subject of major disagreementAfter the St Petersburg talks both Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian admitted that the two sides failed to make progress but declined to explain the reasons for that failure or to specify the nature of the remaining points of contention But a diplomatic source close to the talks told RFERLs Armenian Service that the two presidents disagreed on the future status of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic That source said Aliyev insisted that that final status not be mentioned in the interim peace accord while Armenia insists that accord provide for the holding of a referendum among the unrecognized republics populationOn June 20 speaking at a joint press conference in Yerevan with NATOs special representative for the South Caucasus Robert Simmons Oskanian implicitly blamed Azerbaijan for the lack of headway in St Petersburg Azerbaijan is showing clear signs of a change of position a tendency to renege on some agreements RFERLs Armenian Service quoted Oskanian as saying He added however that we have to wait and watch Azerbaijans further steps to judge whether there is a toughening of its position or a broader policy change He further rejected as untrue claims by Azerbaijani First Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov that the reason the St Petersburg talks failed to yield the hopedfor breakthrough was that Armenia asked for a timeout The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry responded with a statement carried later on June 20 by dayaz accusing Oskanian of seeking to offload the blame for the lack of progress in the talks implying that Armenia itself was the obstacle The statement further affirmed that Azerbaijan responded very constructively to the most recent proposals put forward by the cochairs during their most recent tour of the region The French cochair Bernard Fassier confirmed after the St Petersburg talks that the cochairs have proposed new approaches but did not give any detailsNext MoveGiven the confidentiality that surrounds the negotiating process determining the seriousness of the remaining disagreements and the true reason for the lack of a breakthrough in St Petersburg is difficult if not impossible Commentators on the Karabakh negotiating frequently tend to use interchangeably the terms timeout standstill which does not preclude the resumption of talks at any time deadlock which implies that both sides are either unable or unwilling to maneuver or make concessions and stalemate which in chess implies that one partner is at a mortal disadvantage with the king able only to move into check Which term is most appropriate to the current situation only the negotiators and the mediators can say Oskanian on June 20 explicitly rejected Azerbaijani claims that Armenia has taken a timeout And the fact that the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry on June 20 reaffirmed its commitment to continuing talks on the basis of the cochairs most recent proposals suggests that the present hiatus reflects a standstill rather than deadlock Baku may after all simply be marking time and waiting for the outcome of next months

affection and love for the Albanians without offering them Serb territoriesSerbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic was more measured in his comments to reporters in Belgrade on June 10If the UN resolution on Kosovo was now on the table at the UN Security Council its rather certain it would not get adequate support ie it wouldnt be adopted Jeremic said Countries that are pushing for a

to jointly use a Russianleased radar base in Azerbaijan as part of an antimissile shieldIn a word profound After all Azerbaijan and Armenia which fought a war in the early 1990s are still locked in a bitter dispute And Iran meanwhile is unlikely to view favorably more US military moves on its border Iranian state radio said today that Putins proposal could have serious regional implications in the domain of securityRadio Farda acting Director Mosaddegh Katouzian notes that Tehran and Bakus good relations could be affected and that the issue is likely to be discussed in two weeks during Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejads scheduled visit to BakuDefinitely Iran would be concerned about having those types of bases in Azerbaijan because of its own security Katouzian says So probably in the next talks between President Mahmud Ahmadinejad and Baku officials this is going to come up as a big concernFrozen ConflictThen theres Armenia and Azerbaijan who fought a war in 199194 in which 25000

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian President Robert Kocharian himself a former Karabakh leader are to meet in St Petersburg on June 9 to discuss the standoff over the enclaveInternational mediators have hoped that the two presidents can agree on small steps to improve life for people in NagornoKarabakh But they also fear if dialogue fails violence could resume destabilizing an area that is emerging as a key energy producer and transport route between the Caspian Sea region and Europe Putins missiledefense proposal however appears to risk tipping the balancing act on NagornoKarabakh toward AzerbaijanUpsetting Regional BalanceRasim Musabekov a political analyst based in Baku suggests Azerbaijan could parlay any pivotal role in Washingtons missiledefense shield into obtaining concessions from Armenian in the standoff over NagornoKarabakhThe discussion of this issue alone is raising Azerbaijans strategic importance This is a win for Azerbaijan If we are taken as partners of the United States of America and Russia this would give us certain security guarantees and would lead to obligations on the part of Russia and the United States to settle problems that Azerbaijan is concerned about Musabekov says  Click image to enlargeIn the first place this means restoring Azerbaijans territorial integrity which was violated by Armenian aggression against 20 percent of Azerbaijans territory he addsSo far Azerbaijani authorities have refrained from offering a full reaction to Russias proposal However Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov has told RFERLs Azerbaijani Service that Baku is ready to negotiate bilaterally or we can do it in the trilateral format with the United States and Russia which currently leases the radar base from

been a flood of Russian officials visiting Baku including a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei LavrovNow it appears that the Russians are talking to the Azeris Russian highlevel officials are frequently in Baku You can see them almost every week in Baku talking to Azeri leaders he says And this makes Armenian leaders nervous Obviously there is a clear rapprochement between Moscow and BakuTogether with France the United States and Russia are cochairs of the Minsk Group the body set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to seek solutions to the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1076842.html,Armenia Talks On New Government Enter Third Week ,"May 31, 2007 16:38 GMT",,Participants say the ongoing talks between the HHK and its junior partner in government since 2003 the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD focus not on the number of ministerial portfolios the HHD would receive but on increasing its input into the formulation of government policyBut the real bone of contention may be whether the HHD is prepared to support Sarkisians candidacy in the presidential election due early next yearSarkisian may be reluctant to include the HHD in the new government without a binding pledge of support for his 2008 presidential bidIn his first public comments after the release of the preliminary election returns Sarkisian told journalists in Yerevan on May 16 that the more political forces are included in the government the more trusted that government will beHe added without elaboration we are ready to cooperate with any political force with any individual What Kind Of CoalitionMeeting with election observers one week later he repeated that the HHK is ready to draw capable parliamentary and extraparliamentary forces into the government RFERLs Armenian Service reported But at least one senior HHK member has said the new government will not be a coalition in the classic sense of the wordTentative talks on the composition of the new cabinet took place on May 18 according to the opposition newspaper Hayk that has ties to former President Levon TerPetrossians Armenian PanNational Movement How many subsequent rounds of talks have taken place is unclearSarkisian told journalists on May 28 that negotiations are still going on with the HHD which has 16 parliament mandates and the Bargavach Hayastan Prosperous Armenia BH party headed by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian which is the secondlargest parliament faction with 25 mandates Two top HHD members Armen Rustamian and Hrant Markarian similarly told journalists after a twohour meeting on May 30 with President Robert Kocharian that negotiations on forming a new government are continuing Rustamian confirmed that we have not yet reached agreement on a number of issuesSticking Points RemainMedia reports have generally attributed the delay in reaching agreement on the new cabinet on imputed disagreements over which party should obtain how many and which ministerial portfolios with some analysts suggesting that the sticking point is the HHDs desire to increase the number of ministerial posts it controls possibly by acquiring the defense portfolio In the outgoing government the HHD headed the ministries of Agriculture Education Health Care and Social Welfare Under the Armenian Constitution however it is the prerogative of the president not the prime minister to name the ministers of defense and foreign affairs And some observers have pointed out that Russia is likely to object to the appointment as defense minister of anyone whose proMoscow credentials are perceived to be less than impeccable Outgoing Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian who has served in that post since April 1998 told RFERLs Armenian Service on May 28 that he has not yet received an invitation to join the new governmentOn May 23 Rustamian said the HHD received various kinds of offers of ministerial posts but declined to be more specific He said a decision would be made very soon One week later on May 30 Rustamian denied that the disagreements between the HHK and the HHD center on specific ministerial posts What is at issue he said is the HHDs new proposals and approaches to the functioning of the new government In an interview the previous day with RFERLs Armenian Service Markarian similarly denied the HHD has already accepted an offer of three ministerial portfolios and explained that the negotiations center on more important issues He said the HHD cannot be bribed by a few portfolios to join a government as an appendage but will agree to enter a putative coalition only after ascertaining policies rights and responsibilities Markarian further denied explicitly that the HHD is insisting on naming the new defense ministerLooking Toward The PresidencyBut the most likely explanation for the protracted delay in forming a new government is Sarkisians recent public confirmation that he intends to run for president in the ballot due in early 2008 The Armenian Constitution bars incumbent President Kocharian from seeking a third consecutive term On May 29 Markarian said the HHD is reluctant to commit its members to supporting Sarkisians candidacy but he declined to say whether the party plans to field its own candidate On May 30 Rustamian said that he and Markarian did not discuss the 2008 presidential ballot during their meeting with Kocharian and that the HHD will nominate its own presidential candidate That also means retaining our political independence he said That is the most important thing for any political forceBut Sarkisian for his part may be reluctant to include the HHD in the new government without a binding pledge of support for his presidential bidBH has not yet made any public statement about joining the new government while a member of the Zharangutiun Heritage party headed by USborn former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian told Noyan Tapan on May 22 that the party has not yet been invited to join talks on forming a new cabinetRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by email subscribe to

https://www.rferl.org/a/1076547.html,Armenia Key Players Seek To Maximize Election Gains ,"May 17, 2007 14:21 GMT",,The May 12 vote was hailed by international election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE as a clear improvement demonstrating progress compared with earlier ballots and as largely meeting international standards for democratic elections That evaluation both conveys a heightened degree of legitimacy on the new legislature and suggests a break with Armenias dubious legacy of tainted electionsThe election results largely confirmed general expectations with Prime Minister Sarkisians HHK the overall winner followed by the new Bargavach Hayastan Prosperous Armenia BH party and the HHD Yet the election was not without some surprises First the scale of the HHK victory surpassed nearly all preelection estimates while votes for Prosperous Armenia were surprisingly fewer than expected The HHK garnered nearly onethird of the partylist vote which together with the seats it won in singlemandate constituencies will ensure it 64 or 65 seats in the new 131seat parliament endowing the party with an outright majority Bolstered by its strong position the HHK now offers Prime Minister Sarkisian both a firm platform for dominating the legislative agenda of the new parliament and a strong position for his candidacy in the February 2008 presidential electionProsperous But PopularComing in a distant second Prosperous Armenia polled a mere 147 percent of the vote less than half that cast for the HHK and which will translate into 25 or 26 parliamentary seats That modest showing surprised many as the party steadily acquired political standing and seeming popularity in the preelection period thanks primarily to the massscale distribution of charity and benevolent aid throughout the rural areas of Armenia by party founder and wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian The partys poor showing underscores the extent of political apathy and cynicism in Armenia marked by the ordinary voters inclination to accept both bribes and promises prior to an election but to ignore both once in the voting boothProsperous Armenia was established primarily to provide President Kocharian with the political power base he has never had before rather than from any ideology or political platform Yet even despite garnering fewer votes than it hoped for and in stark contrast to its preelection boast of over 400000 members nationwide the election outcome does not necessarily mark Prosperous Armenias premature eclipse   On the contrary the results actually fulfill the partys stated primary goals  simply to emerge as a new political force and to enter parliament Tasked with a novel political role as more a propresidential than a progovernment party the future of Prosperous Armenia will be closely aligned with that of Kocharian whether he opts for a Boris Yeltsin model of secure presidential retirement or some Vladimir Putinstyle political futureThe third proestablishment party the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD the longserving junior partner in the ruling coalition government improved its position by securing 16 seats compared with 11 in the outgoing parliament and slightly more than 13 percent of the vote But reflecting the intricacies of true parliamentary politics the HHD has simultaneously emerged as a potential kingmaker in the new parliament and as a broker in the formation of a new progovernment coalition in light of Sarkisians stated preference for the broadest possible coalition rather than relying on his parliamentary majority for a HHKonly government Sarkisians rationale is presumably that a broader coalition would expand support for his presidential bid next year while at the same time preventing any potential alliance between the HHD and Prosperous Armenia that could pose a challenge to the HHKOpposition Ranks ChangingThe election also resulted in significant shifts within the parliamentary opposition notably the weakening of the opposition Orinats Yerkir party of former parliament Chairman Artur Baghdasarian With less than 7 percent of the vote the onetime member of the progovernment coalition will have only 10 deputies in the new parliament but Baghdasarian has nonetheless made it clear that he intends to discard the oppositions traditional tactics of boycott and abstention vowing to embark instead on a bold strategy of legislative confrontationSecond if the sidelining of Orinats Yerkir was generally expected the failure of longtime opposition leader Stepan Demirchian and his Peoples Party of Armenia HZhK to surmount the 5 percent threshold for returning to parliament was not The failure of both Demirchian  whom Kocharian defeated in presidential runoffs in 1998 and 2003  and his opposition party to win reelection and the HZhKs dismal 17 percent of the partylist vote may reflect his erstwhile supporters unhappiness at his refusal to sacrifice his personal ambition for the sake of creating a unified opposition blocThe third significant development was the emergence of a new dynamic political actor in the form of the Zharangutiun Heritage party of USborn former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian Official election results gave the party only 6 percent of the vote and a total of six parliament mandates although many Armenians believe that the popular Hovannisian received a far greater number of votes especially in Yerevan The wellliked Hovannisian is hailed as a new opposition force capable of injecting a new sense of optimism and integrity into Armenian politicsWhats AheadAs the countrys uncrowned new opposition leader Hovannisian will most likely eclipse Baghdasarian in terms of both political prowess and popular appeal thanks largely to his personal record He is seen as untainted by corruption and unlike Baghdasarian free from the constraints of past association with the ruling elite Most importantly Hovannisian who first moved to Armenia 16 years ago and served as its foreign minister in 1992 offers something new for Armenian politics while still maintaining an established record of principled opposition and standing He has waged a long battle with the Armenian authorities beginning with the controversial rejection of his candidacy in the 2003 presidential election and culminating in the eviction of his party last year from the building housing its Yerevan headquarters This dual record of political persecution and opposition has only endeared him to ordinary ArmeniansIn this reconfigured political landscape the main players now face the task of forming first a new coalition and then a cabinet Here too the HHD will exert its newfound political power demanding not only the retention of its existing ministerial portfolios agriculture education and social welfare but also seeking the defense minister position for one of its members former Deputy Defense Minister General Artur Aghabekian Aghabekian a leading reformer within the Armenian military who served as deputy to Prime Minister Sarkisian during the latters tenure as defense minister may also bring a new vitality to the post now held by the retirementaged Colonel General Mikheil HarutiunianStill unclear is whether and how the reconfigured political landscape will impact the relationship  and the rumored rivalry  between Sarkisian and Kocharian Over the medium term politics will be driven by Sarkisians clearly stated aspiration to succeed the outgoing president But will Kocharian readily accept a passive role as a lameduck president Crucially will Kocharian choose to ease Sarkisians path to the presidency or to hinder it possibly by backing a rival candidateA

wealthy tycoon and former world armwrestling champion formed the party with Kocharians blessing last year Critics allege that the move was a ploy to siphon votes away from the opposition while

protests in the event that the vote like previous ballots is perceived as less than free and fair while President Robert Kocharian has warned the opposition that any attempt to undermine political stability will elicit an appropriate response from the authorities ,Radical opposition parties have warned that they will convene mass public protests in the event that the vote like previous ballots is perceived as less than free and fair while President Robert Kocharian has warned the opposition that any attempt to undermine political stability will elicit an appropriate response from the authorities  CarbonCopy Elections Of the 131 parliament mandates 90 are to be distributed under the proportional system and the remaining 41 in singlemandate constituencies Initially 27 parties and one electoral bloc applied to participate under the proportional system fielding a combined total of some 1300 candidates   Twentyfour parties and one bloc were formally registered of which two  the Armenian PanNational Movement of former President Levon TerPetrossian and the proKocharian Progressive Party of Armenia  have since withdrawn lowering to 1245 the total number of candidates competing under the partylist system Of the 173 candidates who applied for registration in the singlemandate constituencies 119 remain on the ballot  Candidates voters and outside observers alike all fear that the May 12 ballot will prove a carbon copy of earlier elections that were marred by gross procedural violations including multiple voting ballotbox stuffing and the falsification of election protocols  In light of that flawed track record repeated affirmations by senior officials including Kocharian Sarkisian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian that every effort will be made to ensure that the vote conforms to European standards for a free fair and democratic ballot have met with widespread skepticism  Kocharian reacted with anger to the publication last month of what was billed as the transcript of a conversation between former Parliament Speaker Artur Baghdasarian chairman of the opposition Orinats Yerkir party and a British diplomat in which Baghdasarian asked whether the EU could issue a statement protesting ongoing efforts to secure an election victory for parties that support Kocharian Kocharian slammed that request as tantamount to treason  But widespread fears that the ballot will again be rigged have only been compounded by confident predictions from leading members of Sarkisians HHK For example Galust Sahakian who heads the HHK faction in the outgoing legislature was quoted by Noyan Tapan on May 2 as saying that the party will receive an absolute majority  Unlike the elections of 1999 and 2003 however this time around the HHK faces serious competition in the form of the Prosperous Armenia Bargavach Hayastan party established in late 2005 by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian a close associate of Kocharian Prosperous Armenia boasts several hundred thousand members and its regional activists have reportedly been distributing humanitarian aid on a massive scale to impoverished villagers in a bid to win votes  Neck And Neck A recent opinion poll suggests the HHK and Prosperous Armenia are neck and neck with the former set to garner some 34 percent of the vote compared with 32 percent for the latter according to Noyan Tapan on May 2 The same poll gives the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD the HHKs junior partner in government since 1999 112 percent of the vote compared with 128 percent for Baghdasarians opposition Orinats Yerkir LawBased State party and 7 percent for Artashes Geghamians opposition National Accord Party  Also expected to surmount the 5percent minimum required to win parliamentary representation under the proportional system are the Zharangutiun Heritage party of USborn former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian the Peoples Party of Armenia HZhK headed by Stepan Demirchian the United Labor Party the third member of the present coalition government and Dashink Alliance which is headed by Samvel Babayan the former commander of the NagornoKarabakh armed forces RFERLs Armenian Service noted on May 10 however that attendance at rallies organized by Demirchians HZhK has been far lower than during the 2003 election campaign  Zharangutiun Chairman Hovannisian predicted on May 4 that if the vote is truly free and fair his party will win a plurality of votes RFERLs Armenian Service reported Hovannisian did not exclude the possibility of aligning with three radical groups that have vowed to mobilize voters to protest any attempt to rig the outcome of the vote in favor of the HHK  Those three  former Prime Minister Aram Sargsians Hanrapetutiun Republic party Aram Karapetians Nor Zhamanakner New Times and the Impeachment bloc that includes former TerPetrossian allies  told thousands of supporters at rallies in Yerevan on May 3 and 9 that they will convene mass protests in the event that the election falls short of democratic standards  Sargsian assured supporters that if they again ignore our will if they trample on our rights if they again look down on us we will rise up and gather in this square on May 13 We will march ahead of you we wont hesitate we wont run away Orinats Yerkirleader Baghdasarian has likewise pledged that if the elections are bad we will revolt and struggle for the peoples rights RFERLs Armenian Service reported on May 10  Claims And Counterclaims Opposition leaders claimed that police used truncheons and tear gas against some participants in the May 9 rally but senior police official Major General Ararat Mahtesian denied that on May 10 saying that it was opposition supporters who used tear gas against police Mahtesian also accused the leaders of the three groups of deliberately provoking a violent response RFERLs Armenian Service reported  Also on May 10 leading HHK member Eduard Sharmazanov warned that freedom ends where the law begins and that the authorities have the right to maintain order Noyan Tapan reported Artur Rustamian of the HHD for his part commented on May 10 that some political forces appear to be less interested in winning seats in parliament than in inflaming the postelection atmosphere  Summing up the election campaign on May 10 President Kocharian stressed that it is extremely important that the new parliament and president be able to cooperate If there is a confrontation between these two institutions it is the people who will suffer Kocharian expressed the hope that the HHK will win a weighty presence in the new legislature that would enable the party to continue reforms with renewed vigor and that BH and the HHD would have a serious presence  He made it clear that he would prefer to see only what he described as the constructive opposition winning parliamentary representation Whether or not opposition parties take to the streets of Yerevan in protest on May 13 will depend to a large extent on the degree to which local election commission interpret Kocharians comment as an order rather than as a hypothetical preference RFERL Russia Report SUBSCRIBE

spokesman Vladimir Karapetian immediately denied that Yerevans negotiating position has changed in any way,But both Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian and Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Karapetian immediately denied that Yerevans negotiating position has changed in any wayExplaining his rationale for violating the unwritten agreement that details of the peace process should not be made public until all aspects are finalized Aliyev claimed that the Armenian side has already violated that agreement by distorting the nature of the agreements reached to date zerkaloaz reported on May 5Aliyev said a general agreement has been reached on the Armenian withdrawal which will take place stepbystep over a period of several yearsBut Aliyevs account of what has been agreed to differs considerably from the basic principles for resolving the conflict proposed to the conflict sides last year by the cochairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group which since the summer of 1992 has sought to mediate a settlement Basic PrinciplesThose basic principles were posted on the website of the US Embassy in Yerevan in June 2006 and continue to serve as the nucleus for the ongoing peace talksAliyev said that Armenia has agreed both to the phased approach to resolving the conflict and to a withdrawal from the seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized republic of NagornoKarabakh that it has controlled since 1993 including the strategic Lacin corridor linking NagornoKarabakh with Armenia and the broader Kelbacar district located between the two entities Aliyev said a general agreement has been reached on the Armenian withdrawal which will take place stepbystep over a period of several yearsAt Armenias insistence Aliyev continued Baku has dropped its opposition to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force but the duration of that deployment will be limited Once all seven districts are liberated Aliyev continued the Azerbaijani displaced persons will return to their abandoned homes after which the final status of NagornoKarabakh visavis the central Azerbaijani government will be determined in a manner that preserves the territorial integrity of AzerbaijanHe said that future status would encompass broader autonomy than the region had prior to 1988 as an autonomous oblast within the former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic Those Armenians who want a greater degree of selfdetermination are free to leave Karabakh and resettle in Armenia the daily echoazcom quoted Aliyev as sayingAliyevs claim that Armenia has agreed to the phased approach to resolving the conflict is at odds with the basic principles made public 10 months ago Those principles point to a phasedpackage approach meaning that the various elements of a settlement are all addressed and resolved in one comprehensive peace agreement although not all implemented simultaneously But the basic principles do indeed provide for the gradual redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around NagornoKarabakh with unspecified special modalities for the Kelbacar and Lacin districts International peacekeepers would then be deployed on the demilitarized liberated territories Finally the basic principles stipulated that at some unspecified future date a referendum among the population of the region would be held on the future status of NagornoKarabakh Yerevan however has always insisted that the issue of Lacin and Kelbacar must be addressed separately from that of the other five occupied districts Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told journalists on June 29 2006 that there will be a Lacin corridor linking Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia He added that Armenia will insist that that corridor has the same status as KarabakhPossible ReferendumOskanian also explained that due to security considerations Kelbacar can be returned to Azerbaijani control only after the referendum on NagornoKarabakhs future status In a statement on June 26 2006 pegged to the publication of the basic principles the Armenian Foreign Ministry claimed that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed on holding such a referendum   Azerbaijani soldiers in Karabakh in 1992 AFP The Karabakh leadership however has argued against any such plebiscite on the grounds that it would call into question the legality of referendum held on December 10 1991 in which the Armenian population of NagornoKarabakh voted overwhelmingly for independence from the thenAzerbaijan SSR while the Azerbaijani minority boycotted the vote Aliyev on May 4 made no reference to any future referendum In Yerevan on May 4 Armenian Prime Minister Sarkisian told RFERLs Armenian Service that I dont know what goals the president of Azerbaijan is pursuing but it is known to everyone that we have principles and that those principles have not changed Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Karapetian for his part focused on Aliyevs implicit threat that after 10 years of fruitless peace talks Azerbaijan would be justified in seeking to bring NagornoKarabakh back under its control by military force and that thanks to the recent huge increases in its military spending Azerbaijans armed forces are capable of winning a new war Karapetian construed that militant rhetoric as a reflection of weaknessElections In ArmeniaThere are several possible interrelated reasons why Aliyev should have chosen to sow confusion over the status and key points of the Karabakh peace talks just one week before the May 12 Armenian parliamentary elections Many observers both in Yerevan and abroad believe that a victory in that ballot for Prime Minister Sarkisians Republican Party of Armenia would pave the way for Sarkisians election next year to succeed incumbent Robert Kocharian as president of Armenia Kocharians second term expires in March 2008 and he is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term Aliyevs first presidential term expires in October 2008 but his reelection is considered a givenKocharian and Sarkisian were both born and raised in Karabakh and participated in the 199293 war Sarkisian could thus be expected to continue unchanged the tough policy Kocharian has espoused for the past eight years regarding the timing of an Armenian withdrawal from the occupied districts and the future status of Karabakh Aliyev may well have been hoping to compound the pressure on the Armenian leadership in the runup to the ballot  although it is by no means clear whether in the unlikely event that the opposition launches mass protests at ballot rigging that evolve into a spontaneous revolution that topples the present Armenian leadership the opposition would subsequently adopt a softer line on resolving the conflict Alternatively Aliyev may simply have been hoping to weaken the Kocharian leadership whether or not as a prelude to launching a new military offensiveMoreover Aliyev on May 4 described as a major diplomatic victory for Azerbaijan the recent double revision of the wording of the US State Departments annual report on human rights According to the initial and final version of that report Armenia continues to occupy the Azerbaijani territory of NagornoKarabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories The Armenian leadership protested that formulation which was duly changed but the initial wording was restored in late April after Baku pulled out of highlevel security talks in Washington in protest Aliyev may have been seeking to capitalize on that diplomatic victorySpeaking at Yerevan State University on April 27 President Kocharian referred to preparations under way for a meeting in St Petersburg on June 10 between himself and President Aliyev to resume talks on resolving the Karabakh conflict Noyan Tapan reported Whether Aliyevs May 4 comments will torpedo those plans is not yet clearNagornoKarabakhClick on the map to see an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict areaIn

the same frame with and does not have the same essence of what Hitler did for three main reasons Firstly Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews altogether Hitler was not trying to extradite the Jews from Germany   He wanted to exterminate them everywhere in the world they lived So what happened in the Ottoman state and what Hitler did and led to the creation of the term genocide are quite different Secondly it is important to look at how a society or state organized a crime to see if it was genocide In Nazi Germany we saw the horrible organization of genocideThe Ottoman state however under those circumstances couldnt have done this even if it had wanted to Chaotic things have happened and it is not fully clear who attacked whom and where A small group inside the Special Organization A threemember executive committee established by the Committee of Union and Progress undertook a number of actions in the course of deportation but we cant see any efforts to massacre those left behind And thirdly the Jews were completely innocent and Hitler tried to exterminate them based on fabricated claims But the Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire were involved in armed struggle against the government although it would be an exaggeration to claim that all Armenians engaged in this struggle Cengiz Aktar Bahceshehir University Istanbul   Turkey has never said that Nothing happened in 1915 Sure things happened As a result fewer Armenians were left in the Ottoman Empire while Turks and Kurds remained But I think it was no genocide Research and debate is continuing over whether it was indeed a genocide But certainly whatever is agreed upon it cannot relieve the Ottoman Empire of its responsibility  Yusuf Halacoglu head of Turkish Society of History   The Armenians wanted to create an Armenian state in Anatolia but they werent allowed to There was a fight and they lost itIf the Armenians with the help of the Russians French and British had

Armenians were planning to create an Armenian state in eastern Anatolia   Armed Armenian groups were joining the Russian army to fight the Ottomans They the Armenians were also massacring Turks in the areas in which they were active That means that in 1915 along with the world war there was also a civil war within the Ottoman Empire That is why the Ottoman state exercised its legitimate right of selfdefenseRFERL Elekdag on the possibility of the United States passing a congressional resolution defining the massacre of Armenians as a genocideThe Armenian leadership openly sided with the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1076035.html,Armenia Pain And Sometimes Forgiveness ,"April 23, 2007 11:00 GMT",,Haykuhi Harutyunian 25 linguistWhen I hear the word genocide it has a very deep personal impact since every Armenian family has experienced it personally through their ancestors The pain is very personal for me but I also accept it as a historical reality  although I think we dont have to view it as something thats occured and were simply victims Such an approach is wrong for us now Its high time to step forward and consider the issue from a slightly different standpoint  Perceptions have changed among young people For example if an Armenian and a Turk met 20 years ago there would most probably be some hostility between them But nowadays young people in Armenia and Turkey are on quite good terms I dont carry any hostility within me I feel pain but I have a feeling of immense forgiveness as well I would really like it if we could replace their aggression and our sense of victimization with a brave step toward dialogueI dont believe Turkey will recognize the genocide And for me as a citizen mere recognition is not enough Its not enough for them to say yes it has occured There should be compensation for all the damage and losses as well I want back everything that we lostDavit Gevorgian 21 computer programmer  Recognizing genocide is an obscure concept What does it mean to recognize genocide when its already happened and we all know about it What do we achieve when someone stands up and declares that he recognizes the genocide NothingTurkey is under pressure from the European Union it may or may not recognize it If it does that recognition will simply generation a feeling of satisfaction among a large number of people Nothing moreSvetlana Galoian 45 accountantId like the whole world to deal with this issue Turkey should get down on its knees and ask forgiveness Turkey has never asked forgiveness for all the blood that was spilled and we dont have any reason to forgive them Turkey will never admit its blame on its own theyll only admit it under pressure from powerful countries  Of course we know that recognizing the genocide wont bring back Armenian composer and folklorist Komitas who witnessed the worst of the genocide and Armenian writer Grigor Zohrap who was killed during the genocide But at least Turkeys current generation will know that their ancestors were criminals and murderersTime changes the situation The power of the issue is fading and I cant expect my grandchild will see it the way I do Ive heard so much about it that it seems to me I was there but for my grandchild it surely wont be the same For him it will just seem like a movieSamson Hovhannisian 93 historian  During the war in 1914 Turkish leaders planned the mass destruction of Armenians They didnt want a single Armenian to remain in western Armenia they wanted to own that landThe whole world has recognized the genocide but Turkey still doesnt admit to it Turkey is a lapdog for the United States and it wont be able to take a single step without the US Turkey wont admit to the genocide until US President George W Bush does The day Bush accepts the genocide Turkey will follow suitStepan Avetisian 24 lawyerGenocide is the cruelest most hideous act one human can perform against another For me the Armenian genocide is shameful an indelible part of the history of our nation Its an enormous sorrow an aching wound that hasnt been cured   My ancestors came from Igdir in eastern Turkey at the border with Armenia but they didnt experience the worst of the genocide and perhaps thats why I try to take a slightly more moderate stance on the issue When you read the memoirs of people who lived through it or look at the pictures from that time however its impossible to stay cool and detachedRecognition for me means respect But the issue of recognition has always been taken advantage of and used for political purposes Im a bit conservative about Turkey I dont think theyll admit to genocide Even if they do admit to it it wont change anything significantly My father has a good saying Turkey is a hyena you should always keep the whip handy We

Turks firmly reject Its an issue that continues to blight relations between Armenia and Turkey The two countries do not have diplomatic relations and the 268kilometer border between the two countries has been closed since 1993Armenians say that Turks killed up to 15 millions Armenians in 191518 as the Ottoman Empire was beginning to crumble Turks say the killings were part of the wider conflict of World War I and that only 300000 Armenians diedGlobal RecognitionToday the controversy has gone global with a number of countries debating whether the killings can be called genocide  the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial political or cultural group Many countries including Russia and Canada have passed legislation recognizing the killings as genocide I think we should live in the present since there are more important issues real issues todayIn the United States many members of Congress  dominated by the opposition Democrats  have voiced support for a bill to officially recognize the Armenian killings as genocide The bill has met with stiff opposition from supporters of the presidential administration which is eager to maintain smooth ties with its NATO ally Turkey But even as the genocide debate has occupied international politics some Armenians believe its time for their country to move on Davit Gevorgyan a 21yearold computer programmer from Yerevan says he thinks that pushing the issue of genocide is no longer appropriate We should remember everything thats happened but we dont need to use that to create a certain political course I think we should live in the present time since there are more important issues real issues today Gevorgyan says It would be better to solve these than to devote all our energy and efforts to those old issues Many politicians are using the Armenian genocide to create their political platform in Armenia and it serves as a trump card a way to manipulate people They simply abuse itPolitically ChargedBut politicians in both countries arent likely to shift toward a more moderate stance on the genocide issue in the months ahead Armenia holds parliamentary elections in May Turkey will have presidential and general elections this year A dramatic policy switch on such an emotional issue could prove a massive political liability in a season when officials will be fighting to hold onto votes Soner Cagaptay who heads the Turkish research program of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington DC says that the public is as staunch in some ways on this issue and in their entrenched commitments as the politicians are  An Armenian woman mourns the death of a boy during the deportation epa Officially Turkey has said that to establish diplomatic relations it would require Armenia to drop its policy on seeking recognition of the genocide internationallyHowever some Turkish politicians have said that Turkey should not attach such preconditions to the opening of the borderThat is mirrored by recent Armenian comments Speaking at the OSCE in Vienna recently Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that in order to normalize relations with Turkey the Armenian side has no preconditions and expects that Turkey should not have any eitherWhat complicates the issue is the powerful and wealthy Armenian diaspora The diaspora has huge lobbying power in the West particularly in the United StatesCagaptay says that Armenia and the Armenian diaspora do not always have the same position Armenia seems to be more prodialogue with Turkey  unconditional dialogue that is Whereas the Armenian diaspora will not start a dialogue or a normalization of the relations unless Turkey unconditionally recognizes there is something called the Armenian genocide Cagaptay saysAnother complication in relations between the two countries is NagornoKarabakh the ethnic Armenian enclave that Azerbaijan Turkeys traditional ally and Armenia fought over in the beginning of the 1990sBusiness LinksDespite the impasse however there are significant business links between the two countries The border while officially closed is quite porous in places Traders also travel from Armenia via Georgia to sell their goods in Turkey Some Armenians labor as guest workers in eastern Turkey and there are regular flights between Yerevan and IstanbulMany in the business community in

https://www.rferl.org/a/1076004.html,US NGO Says Focus On Foreign Spending Shifting ,"April 21, 2007 15:41 GMT",,RFERL If it were up to Freedom House where would the US government be focusing its efforts to support overseas democraciesAmanda Abrams In repressive societies and in those that are becoming increasingly repressive the real way to attack whats going on is to support the NGOs and the human rights activists because these folks are really the substance of the movement that can maybe reverse thingsRFERL How has the United States shifted its focusAbrams For example they are working with the judiciary  which of course is worthwhile  working with legislatures working with the legislative branch So sort of going more from the top down and looking more at governance issues Which are certainly quite valid but theyre only part of the pictureRFERL Your report expresses concern about the need for US aid to individuals and NGOs in the former Soviet Union particularly Russia Can you elaborateAbrams It definitely seems that President Vladimir Putin has done  is doing  what he can to stifle independent voices And there have been increasing restrictions  particularly the NGO law and other activities  so that even with the presence of opposition parties theres been less and less freedom for opposition voices to be heard This we think is really not combating the issue at allRFERL Does Freedom House have any other special concerns in the former Soviet UnionAbrams In Uzbekistan for example Umida Niyazova is a journalist and human rights activist whos been in custody since midJanuary Shes somebody who could get up to 30 years in prison Her charges are illegal border crossing and possessing illegal literature which is essentially Human Rights Watch documents and another charge thats very similar And basically shes just a human rights activist whos we think being targeted specifically for those activities So someone like her  there are various things that she might need and certainly before we even get to the point of someone like her being arrested these folks need our support And often that support is monetary or in resourcesRFERL Had the US government supported Niyazova until nowAbrams I think off and on I know she Niyazova had worked with international human rights groups I dont even know frankly if the infrastructure exists yet in the US government to really reach out to human rights activists to the degree that we could and on sometimes an emergency basis There are some funds that are there for working with human rights activists on an emergency basis but often it may be limited just to legal defense funds So if this Niyazova case was seen as important to the US government we would want to see a lot more flexibility in some of the funding tools for these human rights defendersRFERL So far weve focused on Freedom Houses concerns about the proposed US budget for promoting democracy Are there any positive elements in the budgetAbrams In a general sense yes Were seen an increase in democracy funding around the world which is great and were also seeing increases in certain regions but the former Soviet Union isnt one of the regions thats really receiving an increase Id say generally speaking Central Asia for example has been sort of overlooked and is generally going down in terms of funding The Caucasus  were urging more funding in a general sense not so much for Armenia but for Azerbaijan and Georgia Even Ukraine  were saying Dont forget about it So each country has a different situation but in a number of cases either theyre being seen we think as lost causes like Uzbekistan or political issues like Russia or already have graduated viewed as already have graduated to democracy like Georgia and Ukraine And with those two we dont think they have quite graduated yet and theyre not quite ready to be left aloneRFERL Do you mean to say that the United States in a way is shifting its focus away from the former Soviet Union on human rights and democracy issuesAbrams Perhaps It seems they have done some reprioritizing Theres been increased democracy funding for Africa and we very much congratulate that But perhaps theyve decided to consolidate a bit their funding and their programming to some of the countries that maybe matter more or that theres a better chance of affecting So that may be to some degree why theres been a bit of a shiftRFERLs Broadcast CountriesA boy sells balloons in Kabul because he is unable to go to school epaA BLEAK PICTURE Below HRW experts comment on the human rights situations in some of RFERLs broadcast countriesHuman Rights Watchs Asia Research Director Sam Zarifi speaking about AfghanistanThe Taliban have been using increasingly brutal tactics such as suicide bombings and attacking soft targets such as health clinics and schools The attacks on schools have been particularly vicious More than 200000 children who were in school last year have not been able to go to school this year Weve seen over 130 schools attacked The resulting fear of course has caused a huge amount of resentment especially in southern Afghanistan because ordinary Afghans feel that President Hamid Karzai and his international backers are not able to support them and provide them what they need Basic reconstruction and development throughout the south has essentially come to a halt in many areas The situation is not just bad in the south however In the north and in the west of the country warlords  many of them ostensibly allied with the government  have also used the threat of the Taliban and the weakness of the international community and President Karzai to reentrench themselves and so Human Rights Watch has been documenting numerous instances of land grabs political oppression and rampant human rights abuses by these warlords many of whom are also involved in the drug tradeGiorgi Gogia of Human Rights Watchs Caucasus Office speaking about GeorgiaGeorgia in late 2005 announced a reform of its criminal justice system and started a rigorous fight against organized crime particularly against the power of organized crime bosses While this move is certainly commendable this had some negative consequences particularly overcrowding in prisons and abuse of power by some police or law enforcement structures Overcrowding is particularly a big problem in Georgian prisons considering that they are very poorly ventilated filthy and prisoners very often receive inadequate nutrition and substantive medical careRachel Denber deputy director of Human Rights Watchs Europe and Central Asia division speaking about KyrgyzstanIn September Human Rights Watch released a report that documented the poor state response to domestic violence and bride kidnapping for forced marriage in Kyrgyzstan Our main finding which I think is consonant with the conclusions of Kyrgyz human rights organizations is that the authorities just allow for impunity for domestic violence and kidnapping for forced marriageRachel Denber deputy director of Human Rights Watchs Europe and Central Asia division speaking about TurkmenistanTurkmenistan is one of the worlds most repressive and closed countries The authorities severely suppress all forms of dissent and they absolutely isolate the population from the outside world The president who just passed away on December 21 President Saparmurat Niyazov had declared himself president for life He presided over a massive and grotesque cult of personality This year due to international pressure the government reduced some harassment of followers of minority religions they released several people from psychiatric institutions where they had been forcibly detained as a measure of punishment And they allowed one dissident to travel abroad But otherwise 2006 was as disastrous as every other year for human rights in TurkmenistanRachel Denber deputy director of Human Rights Watchs Europe and Central Asia division speaking about Uzbekistan2006 was one of the worst years for human rights in Uzbekistan in the 15 years since Uzbekistans independence from the Soviet Union There has still been no justice for the massacre that happened in May 2005 in Andijon in Uzbekistan during which government troops fired on mostly unarmed protestors  no justice for that whatsoever And the Uzbek government has continuously rejected all efforts to have an international independent investigation of the massacre The government crackdown on human rights defenders independent journalists and political activists is the fiercest we have ever seen in Uzbekistan since independence
https://www.rferl.org/a/1075967.html,Armenia Election Campaign Gets Off To Uneasy Start ,"April 19, 2007 15:02 GMT",,Senior officials have repeatedly affirmed their determination to ensure a clean vote But many commentators predict that the oppositions failure to align in a single  or even several  blocs will prevent it from beating two rival proestablishment parties that benefit from virtually unlimited financial and administrative resourcesInfluential FigureSerzh Sarkisian the powerful former defense minister who became prime minister and head of the ruling Republican Party of Armenia HHK following the untimely death last month of Andranik Markarian is increasingly perceived to have the power to determine the outcome of the ballot Asked on April 10 how many votes he thinks his Peoples Party will win Tigran Karapetian responded That is known only to God and Serzh Sarkisian Noyan Tapan reported  A total of 24 parties and one electoral bloc succeeded in registering to contest the 90 of 131 parliament mandates to be allocated under the proportional system and 1314 individual candidates registered in the remaining 41 singlemandate constituencies  The overwhelming majority  80 percent  of outgoing parliamentarians are seeking reelection But the oppositions inability to close ranks and create a single strong bloc is likely to limit dramatically its chances of success The daily Zhamanak Yerevan calculated on April 14 that not a single one of the 20 opposition parties stands a chance of garnering the minimum 5 percent of the proportional vote required to win parliamentary representation Even if each of those parties wins 4 percent of the vote the paper pointed out giving the opposition 80 percent those votes would not translate into a single one of the 90 proportional mandates   There have already been several incidents of electionrelated violence Even before the campaign officially began police in Yerevan were forced to intervene on March 15 to end a brawl between supporters of the HHK and of the Prosperous Armenia Bargavach Hayastan party founded in late 2005 by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian Two local Prosperous Armenia offices in Yerevan were rocked by explosions during the night of April 1112 but no one was injured  As in previous parliamentary ballots it is in the singlemandate constituencies where pressure on  and discrimination against  opposition candidates is crudest  In Echmiadzin south of Yerevan unidentified perpetrators opened fire on April 8 on a car belonging to a rival candidate to retired General Seyran Saroyan who is supported by the HHK while the election headquarters of a second rival were destroyed in an arson attack  Days later a local court annulled the registration of both candidates after Saroyan filed a lawsuit alleging that they forged signatures submitted in support of their registration  Elsewhere especially in rural areas powerful local governors who are members of or aligned with the HHK are already being accused of intimidating opposition candidates or denying them the opportunity to meet with voters Two opposition parties  Orinats Yerkir LawBased State  which is headed by former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian and Zharangutiun headed by USborn former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian  have complained that their activists have been refused permission to post campaign posters Noyan Tapan reported on April 17  Up In The AirAdding to the widely held perception that the deck is stacked against smaller political parties are the provisions for media access  True the election law allows each party registered to participate in the ballot a total of 60 minutes free airtime on Armenian Public Television and 120 minutes on staterun radio with the option of purchasing a further 120 minutes of television and 180 minutes of radio airtime  But as Haykakan zhamanak noted on April 11 that free media access is divided into maximum twominute segments which makes it very difficult if not impossible to convey a clear coherent and memorable impression of a partys political program given that even the most politically interested viewers are unlikely to make a point of watching several hours of electionrelated programming every single night for several weeks  And the prices set by Armenian Public Television for additional airtime are prohibitively high as are those charged by its privately owned and overwhelmingly proestablishment counterparts  Armenian Public Television announced in February it will charge 80000 drams approximately 225 per minute for electionrelated advertising compared with 120 during the 2003 parliamentary election while privately owned channels will charge up to 100000 drams 280 per minute The election law sets a cap of 60 million drams or 160000 on campaign spending Moreover 18 of Armenias 29 local television stations have decided not to air any campaign advertising at all  With ideological differences between the various parties almost totally eclipsed by their avowed determination to win or hold on to parliament seats opposition politicians are apprehensive that some impoverished voters will avail themselves of the material benefits offered by Prosperous Armenia in return for a promise to vote for that partys candidate  During a visit to Aragatsotn Province on April 18 Orinats Yerkir Chairman Baghdasarian appealed to voters to reject the 10000 drams 27 he claimed they have been offered to vote for an unspecified rival party RFERLs Armenian Service reported  Alternatively as in several previous national ballots some voters may simply not bother to vote at all Opposition candidates claimed at the time that official statistics showing that just over 50 percent of registered voters cast their ballots during the May 2003 parliamentary election were exaggerated and the true figure was far lower  A delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that visited Yerevan last week registered in an April 13 statement its concern over the overall impression of a lack of popular interest in the election process by the electorate Such attitudes of apathy or even cynicism are not conducive to the development of democracy in Armenia RFERLs Armenian Service reported  Such reservations though cautiously phrased may nonetheless have a greater impact on the May 12 election than similar warnings in the past  Since 1996 when key figures within the Armenian PanNational Movement falsified the outcome of the presidential ballot to ensure the reelection of incumbent Levon TerPetrossian international monitoring missions spearheaded by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE have evaluated every single national ballot whether presidential or parliamentary as not meeting international standards for a free and fair election Grave Consequences This time around Armenia stands to forfeit funds allocated under the US Millennium Challenge Account or to have its cooperation with the European Union within the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy curtailed if the conduct of the ballot is deemed unsatisfactory  Cognizant of such possible negative repercussions senior Armenian officials including Prime Minister Sarkisian have in recent months sought to convince international observers that this election will be different  Meeting on April 16 in Yerevan with longterm OSCE election observers ProsecutorGeneral Aghvan Hovsepian said that his agency has set up special working groups headed by senior prosecutors that will react immediately to reports of serious irregularities during the vote RFERLs Armenian Service reported  Hovsepian also said he is taking all measures to preclude his subordinates direct involvement in the election campaign  But speaking on April 18 at a press conference in Yerevan Central Election Commission KNH Chairman Garegin Azarian said that to date his commission has so far received 10 formal complaints from either parties or individual candidates RFERLs Armenian Service reported He said he considered that figure okay  Meanwhile the KNH is posting voter lists on its website in the hope of minimizing cases in which potential voters are unable to cast their ballots because they discover only on election day that their names do not figure on such lists What percentage of voters especially in remote rural areas has Internet access enabling them to take advantage of that innovation is unclear howeverFURTHER READING  Deja Vu Once AgainArmenias May parliamentary elections are

will maintain at least 30 percent growth in 2007 to lead the world It also notes rapid growth in Turkmenistan 14 percent and Kazakhstan 105 percent But the commission also warns that those economies are too reliant on revenues from fossil fuels and advises neighbors to seek ways to capitalize on the economic momentum of China India and JapanThe UNs Dutch director of Development Policy and Analysis Robert Vos joked at a briefing that his nationality makes him an expert on the Dutch disease The exception to high growth is Kyrgyzstan where Vos says the economy expanded at a moderate 27 percent in 2006 after a decline the previous year That term is a reference to problems that arise when revenues from natural resources put unhealthy pressure on manufacturing and other sectorsVos noted that the fossilfueled economies of Central Asia and the Caspian have little to worry about as long as crudeoil prices remain above 60 a barrelBut if not he said the threat of Dutch disease is greatest in Azerbaijan Kazakhstan and RussiaWhat Dutch disease subsequently does is that it puts a stop on further diversification of their economies Vos said So if the oil prices for instance would go down in the coming years they would have major problems in keeping up the economic growth and the living standards they have now  because they havent diversified sufficiently in other activitiesWatching ImbalancesIn Azerbaijan the report notes that oil and petrochemicals accounted for more than three quarters 768 percent of all export revenues in 2006Its authors say the Azerbaijani and other governments are well aware of the threat of the Dutch disease and have undertaken tight monetary and fiscal policies  along with other broad measures  to address its symptomsThe report argues that Azerbaijan and Russias preemptive measures have increased their immunity But the situation is more precarious in Kazakhstan The report warns that reliance on hydrocarbon resources has adversely affected the structure of Kazakhstans economy It notes disparities between the oil sector and just about everything else Alternative Economic FuelThe commission says other economies in the region  less reliant on hydrocarbons  fared relatively well in 2006Armenias economy grew by 134 percent owing mainly to a construction boom Georgias economic expansion continued with 7 percent growth Uzbekistan posted 73 percent growth and Tajikistan was not far behind at 7 percentThe exception to high growth is Kyrgyzstan where Vos says the economy expanded at a moderate 27 percent in 2006 after a decline the previous year Whats happening in the Central Asian countries is that either they have very strong oil exports or they have very strong influxes of remittances foreign earnings that citizens send to their home countries particularly from those that work in the Russian Federation Vos saidThe reports authors caution that inflation is high and rising throughout Central Asia and the Caspian region  with the exception of Armenia  despite tight monetary policiesArmenia was able to contain inflation at 29 percent in 2006 through the governments willingness to allow the national currency the dram to appreciate against major Western currencies The dram has appreciated more than 40 percent against the US dollar since the beginning of 2004 the report notes That has hurt Armenias exporters and its citizens who are dependant on cash sent from abroadWomen At A DisadvantageThe UN commission also confront the issue of gender discrimination throughout Asia and its negative economic effects It notes that female access to health services and education leaves women powerless intellectually materially and politically   Young journalists undergoing training in Almaty RFERL file

https://www.rferl.org/a/1075951.html,South Caucasus Is Russia Losing Influence ,"April 19, 2007 09:11 GMT",,RFERLs Armenian Azerbaijani and Georgian services invited de Waal to participate in a roundtable discussion on the issue as part of their regular Caucasus Crossroads series Also participating in the discussion were Ivliane Khaindrava a lawmaker from Georgias opposition Republican Party Rauf Mirkadyrov a columnist for Azerbaijans Zerkalo newspaper and Stepan Grigorian the director of the Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in the Armenian capital Yerevan The discussion was moderated by RFERLs Andrei BabitskyRFERL To start lets have Thomas de Waal explain the premise of his articleThomas de Waal My thesis is paradoxical Of course Russia is stronger politically and economically than it was 10 years ago But as a result of its shortsighted policies Russia is losing influence in the Caucasus As a result of Russias blockade of Georgian wine and agricultural products Georgia has opened its economy its market to other countries In Azerbaijan Gazproms very shortsighted policies pushed Azerbaijan into a more proWestern position This is even happening in Armenia whose position about the Georgian blockade was not taken into account and where Georgians were able to hold a demonstration in front of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan about xenophobia in Russia My thesis is that Russias domestic and energy policies are dictating its foreign policy And on all fronts Russia is losing its position in the CaucasusRFERL How much is this thesis justified Lets look first at Georgia Ivliane Khaindrava If we look at the way the Russian political establishment categorizes its priorities Russia is losing Georgia and losing it at a very fast pace If we look at the categories were talking about  military political Russian foreignpolicy interests the rules of the game in economics and energy  then Russia is losing its influence Accordingly Georgia is becoming increasingly liberated from Russia At the same time if we are operating from a normal understanding of the 21st century I dont think there is a particular problem Georgias economic space is open to Russian capital and in the past years there have been projects with local and Russian investment Georgias information space is open At home I can watch 12 Russian channels On the other hand there isnt really any particular reason why I would want to watch them If Russia is prepared for close relations with a smaller and weaker Georgia then theres no problem But if Russia aspires to be a hegemon they will not succeed Because for the Georgian political establishment this question has been decided Weve decided that the days of speaking to us as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov tried to speak to us  saying that Russia will not allow Georgia to join NATO  are over Well do everything we can so that you cant speak to us this way RFERL Is there a general sense that Russia is simply seeking to fill its pockets instead of pursuing common interests and sympathetic ties with neighbors like AzerbaijanRauf Mirkadyrov I dont think this is what has determined Russias latest steps toward the countries of the South Caucasus including Georgia In recent years there have undoubtedly been serious changes in Russia It went from a state that had a financial crisis in 1998 to one with the third or fourthlargest gold and currency reserves in the world This influences its policy which has become more stringent There are also other factors At the end of the day Russia could have continued to give favorable economic treatment to the countries of the South Caucasus There is a country in the region that affirms Russian and Kremlin policy  Armenia But this favorable treatment didnt continue for the simple reason that one of the South Caucasus countries Georgia very quickly became uncontrollable It defined its foreignpolicy priorities as joining NATO and integrating with the European Union if possible Maybe some of Russias actions made Georgia and the countries of the North Atlantic bloc act faster It seems to me that Russia since the end of last year has sought to bind Azerbaijan to its side and pull it away from the West once and for all To tie them to an antiGeorgian coalition and to themselves and pull them away from the West once and for all To tie them to an antiGeorgian coalition and achieve a revanche This didnt happen Now I think there is a reevaluation of this policy  particularly with the events surrounding Iran RFERL Russia has a very rich imperial tradition In the 18th and 19th centuries Russia didnt dictate to those on its territories how to behave It raised the social standard It brought the regional elite into its own How do you explain the clumsy and insulting way that Russia is now trying to control the situation Stepan Grigorian I first want to say that lately were always talking about Russias economic growth its large budget its huge reserves The question is whats the quality of this growth There is no quality there This growth is only the result of rising gas and oil prices on world markets Since Russias economic growth is only a result of selling oil and gas it strengthens corporations Therefore Russian policy today is not just the policy of the state toward the South Caucasus and the countries of the CIS but also the policy of major corporations Analogies are difficult to find in the Russian empire or even in the Soviet Union Any corporate system works this way They dont look at the political consequences of their actions Therefore our country has suffered and is moving away from Russia This is not just because of the political problems with Georgia but also because Russias closure of the Verkhny Lars crossing point between Armenia and Georgia automatically meant  and Russia didnt even think about this and highranking officials arent interested  that Armenias ground communications were closed off What does this mean In the last halfyear to year since that border crossing point was closed Armenian businessmen began orienting themselves toward Western markets So even in a place where the elite is not badly disposed toward Russia they are reorienting themselves toward the West The poorly conceived policies of Russia toward the South Caucasus  including Armenia  are causing the reorientation of the political elite Russia grew a bit stronger financially  not technologically economically or industrially just financially And now the Russian political elite seems to be under the impression that they can compete with the West and the United States for the South Caucasus Russias recent actions toward Georgia and Azerbaijan are connected to this illusion But I think the movement of NATO the EU and the United States toward the South Caucasus will continueRFERL In the early years of Putins presidency a lot of political observers said his foreign policy appeared to be based on the principle of selfcontainment Russia needed to be strengthened internally and reject ties with the outside world including the near abroad Could it be that Russia just doesnt need the South Caucasus and thats why its treating it this way De Waal Any politician in Russia who says they need to be friendly with the South Caucasus of course wont win any political points I think the problem is that Russia doesnt understand the difference between the near and far abroad The countries of the South Caucasus correctly see themselves as independent countries and are building relationships with the West with Washington Moscow hasnt sufficiently understood this yet They still think these are our neighbors our former republics They dont understand the finer points of the current foreign policies of these countries Putin himself doesnt understand Does he want Russia to be the successor of the Soviet Union or does he want to liberate Russia from the Soviet Union RFERL Thomas de Waals commentary also talks about the problem of a serious cultural divide between Russia and the South Caucasus  that in 10 or 15 years the Russian language will no longer be spoken in the region Does this seem realisticKhaindrava Its perfectly obvious that Russian culture  not in terms of its existence of course but in terms of language  is quickly losing its position in Georgia It was once the obvious second language in Georgia but that has already stopped being the case The younger generation including teenagers are already going with English As far as values go things have also happened quickly The Russian doctrine is an unclear conception of Eurasiaism It is interesting to me whether Russian citizens even understand what that is In Georgia the most popular doctrine is Europeanism and the aspiration to affirm ourselves and our state as a faraway province but nevertheless a province of Europe Russia is closer to Europe and there was once a sense that Georgia would get to Europe via Russia But the process of disassociation from Russia happened very quickly When the antiGeorgian campaign began in Russia it was also an overall antiCaucasus campaign aimed against anyone with a Caucasian appearance In Georgia  even when Russia was seen as Georgias biggest headache even as everybody was saying Russia was Georgias biggest problem  there wasnt any xenophobia in Georgia RFERL Today a lot of people are hoping the Russian regime will change and become more democratic If that proves the case perhaps after the Russian presidential election in March 2008 could the countries of the South Caucasus envision Russia as a close political and cultural partner as they do with the WestMirkadyrov The situation in each country varies Look at Azerbaijan In the beginning of 2006 they were Russias strategic partner But in the end Azerbaijan was talking about leaving the CIS Russia was not acting like a friend and partner to Azerbaijan Armenia has a different situation Its more oriented toward its neighbors because their choices can override Armenias choices Armenia doesnt have a border with Russia The choices of Georgia and Azerbaijan can override Armenias foreignpolicy choices What about Azerbaijan I completely agree that recent actions by Russia have scared away even the elite in Azerbaijan They have begun to look at Russia as something dangerous Its policy is oriented toward establishing if not the former Soviet Union then a of kind of empire where there is some freedom but where Russia views the territory as its own Russia looks at these countries as its own and this feeling has recently gotten stronger This tendency isnt likely to reverse Moreover theres another strong tendency Thats the feeling that these countries need to change their foreignpolicy orientations work more closely with NATO and the EU and in the future join these structures Under these conditions and in this political situation  and also given the situation surrounding Iran  I dont think the South Caucasus countries will move closer to Russia RFERL There are certain democratic criteria that countries must meet in order to be close to the West Armenia and Azerbaijan while not very far from this criteria arent very close to it either If this doesnt happen will these countries move back toward RussiaGrigorian Thank you that is an excellent question I want to point out three factors which make it impossible to return to Russias side One is the quality of Russias political elite  and we need to remember that they are not politicians but people from the special services who have their specific world Second the unattractiveness of Russia  the absence of democracy the lack of technology and interesting scientific work The third factor is more important as to why the South Caucasus are going to the West It is the selfsufficiency of Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey which are realizing very serious projects that will enable us to diversify oil and gas routes transport and the like These things are pushing us to the side of the West We have problems with democracy Does this disturb things or not I am certain that our political elite will change and become more democratic RFERL Thomas de Waal you opened the debate and you should finish it De Waal Im glad for the words of support from the South Caucasus I would like to raise one question that Ivliane also raised the question of the Russian language This is a Russian resource that is dying in the South Caucasus It is a language that unites three countries that unites Abkhazia with Russia and Georgia Russia is not utilizing this resource in the way that Britain utilizes its resource through the British Council The Russian language has a lot of cultural significance and a lot of possibilities And with this Russia could have a very positive influence on the South CaucasusFURTHER READING  Moscow AscendantRussian foreign policy today is such that for the first time in its history Russia is beginning to protect its national

https://www.rferl.org/a/1075719.html,Armenia Prime Ministers Appointment Could Trigger Upheaval ,"April 05, 2007 14:30 GMT",,While such political change is neither especially new nor particularly surprising for Armenia it has injected a new sense of tension and upheavalThese changes culminated on April 4 with Armenian President Robert Kocharians appointment of longtime Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian to serve as the countrys acting premier following the sudden death from heart failure on March 25 of Andranik Markarian who had served in that position since May 2000MORE Coverage of Armenias upcoming electionsPressure Mounts For Clean ElectionsParliamentary Ballot A New Twist On Deja VuAlthough a temporary appointment which expires with the election of a new parliament and the subsequent formation of a new cabinet the move may end or at least defer the recent political upheaval sparked by Markarians death Yet it may be too little too late as Markarians death has already altered the Armenian political landscape and upset the prior political balance between two rival progovernment parties For the ruling political elite Markarians death could not have come at a worse time Markarian was the fulcrum in Armenias domestic political struggle both by virtue of his position within the ruling progovernment coalition and as the pivotal balance between two rival progovernment parties his own Republican Party of Armenia HHK and the newfound power of the Bargavach Hayastan BH Prosperous Armenia party headed by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian Rumor MillThe sudden and unexpected nature of the premiers death also sparked confusion and rumor ranging from the everpresent conspiracy theories around his illtimed demise to public confusion among both officials and observers alike over claims that Sarkisian had already been appointed to fill the vacant postMuch of the confusion was reported in the newspaper Iravunk which revealed that leaders of the governing Republican Party began discussing the question of who will be Armenias next prime minister just hours after Markarians death The urgency of the crisis forced Sarkisian to hurry back to Armenia abruptly canceling a visit to China and ordering his plane to turn around in midflight And as Iravunk noted the process went through several stages with Sarkisian heading straight for the presidents office upon landing in YerevanParty ControlHaving sensed the necessity for being present at such a critical time Sarkisians return enabled him to secure the backing of the ruling Republican Party of Armenia HHK which named him as its sole candidate to replace Markarian in a latenight meeting on April 2 The selection of Sarkisian who assumed the number two spot within the party leadership last summer virtually ensured his appointment as premier after an agreement was reached on March 26 in a meeting between Kocharian and the progovernment parties represented in the Armenian parliament that confirmed that the post would go to a candidate from the Republican Party It also secured Sarkisians control over the party and allowed him to assume full leadership taking over the number one spot held by the late MarkarianYet the appointment of Sarkisian as interim prime minister may spark a confrontation on two fronts It will likely exacerbate existing tensions between BH and the HHK old guard led by Sarkisian That conflict is centered on a jockeying for position prior to the 2008 presidential election as much as it is about garnering power in the new parliament But it may also feature an internal confrontation within the Republican Party between the Sarkisian camp and the ranks of Markarian loyalists emboldened by the outpouring of grief and popular support for the late premierPresidential BidBut the real question is who will succeed incumbent President Kocharian who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term when his current term expires in 2008The presidents assumed chosen successor Sarkisian has positioned himself fairly well with a view to utilizing his position as the new leader of the dominant Republican Party HHK as his platform for a later presidential bid Sarkisians virtual takeover of the leadership of the HHK from the late prime minister in summer 2006 gave rise to tensions within that party which were reportedly defused by a tradeoff under which following a HHK election victory Markarian would have received the post of parliament speaker in return for ceding the premiership to Sarkisian Now that the terms of that putative powersharing agreement no longer apply Armenias current parliamentary speaker Tigran Torosian  a veteran HHK member  is in a much stronger position to retain his post after the election   Markarians funeral on March 28 Onnik KrikorianEurasia NetEven before the May 12 election Markarians untimely death could impact on political stability in other ways As the countrys longestserving prime minister Markarian came to personify a mediating role within Armenias traditionally cutthroat politics conferring a degree of internal stability that set his tenure apart from that of his predecessors It remains to be seen whether the junior coalition partner the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD will inherit that role as a mediator between the two rival progovernment campsAt the same time the new situation has presented new opportunities for Defense Minister Sarkisian The new landscape allowed him to consolidate his personal power and authority within the HHK by either sidelining or coopting the remaining Markarian loyalists And the appointment also offers an early start to his effort to present himself publicly as a viable if not necessarily popular successor to KocharianWhile it may prove to have been a tactical mistake for Sarkisian to assume the position at this early stage rather than after the elections he may enhance his control over more of the administrative resources of the state Nevertheless his move has forced him to cede his everpowerful role as defense minister a critical position whose current vacancy only adds to the tension and upheaval As interim premier Sarkisian is likely to bolster his position in the face of the mounting pressure from his only real rival BH The power and appeal of that party formed just over one year ago by Gagik Tsarukian a wealthy businessman with close personal ties to Kocharian has peaked however And although its claims of collecting more than 370000 members a startling figure that would be equal to roughly 10 percent of the total population of Armenia has been matched by its growing popularity the real lasting power of the party is actually limited by its missionDespite expectations that the BH party will gain the secondlargest number of parliament mandates after the HHK its mission is limited to providing political support and a possible platform for outgoing President Kocharian and his closest associates This suggests that any tension or instability from this rivalry will not carry over to the presidential election But this also means that the coming weeks will pose a crucial test for the country only compounded by preelection tensions under the strain of intense scrutiny and higher expectations for clean electionsMost importantly an end to the relative preelection calm from the forging of a virtual powersharing agreement among the countrys competing elites also questions the promise of fair elections On the one hand Sarkisian now holds a premiership that makes him both more secure in terms of political positioning but also more vulnerable at the same time having given up the powerful post of defense minister This may actually push him to do everything he can to ensure improved elections as it will be seen as much as a test of him and his leadership and not just a test for the country On the other hand if attempts to adjust and adapt to this recent political upheaval fail or if conflict escalates the contending elites may be even more tempted to resort to the irregularities and fraud that marred previous ballots And this reveals a deeper deficiency in Armenian politics  namely that the political system is far too dependent on individuals and lacks the institutions crucial for true democratic resilience and political stabilityRFERL

officials today to discuss the death of Markarian and the important ramifications it has on the May parliamentary elections In a brief statement the Armenian government cited heart paralysis as the cause of Markarians death while a senior medic spoke of acute heart failureI think romantically but am a pragmatist  Andranik MarkarianHistory Of Heart ProblemsAccording to Artem Petrosian the head of Yerevans municipal ambulance service the 55yearold chairman of the governing Republican Party of Armenia HHK was unconscious and his heart had stopped beating when ambulance crews arrived at his apartment in the early afternoon They immediately registered a heart stoppage and clinical death Petrosian told RFERL Markarian was immediately given resuscitation treatment but did not respond the official said He said pathologists will determine the exact cause of deathMarkarian had a history of serious heart problems and had two heart operations  first in Armenia in 1999 and later in France He regularly visited French and Russian clinics for medical examinationsFor us for the country the party and his friends this is a huge loss Tigran Torosian the parliament speaker and a senior member of the HHK told A1Plusam Torosian credited Markarian with the HHKs success and achievements registered by Armenia in recent yearsDefense Minister Serzh Sarkisian the no 2 figure in the official HHK hierarchy was in Moscow on his way to China for an official visit when he heard of Markarians death He reportedly cancelled the trip and is due back in YerevanEmergency Government MeetingIn the meantime Kocharian promptly expressed deep sorrow and offered his condolences to Markarians family He also formed a special commission headed by Torosian and tasked with organizing Markarians state funeral The state commission today held its first meeting Kocharians office said in a press releaseIn a separate short statement the presidential press service said Kocharian has called an emergency meeting of the countrys highranking leadership No further details were reportedThe HHKs governing board is expected to meet separately later in the day According to Torosian the meeting will take place after Sarkisians return to Yerevan Dozens of senior Republican Party members some of them in tears were waiting for Sarkisian the powerful defense chief at the party headquarters in the city center in the eveningLongtime PoliticianA computer engineer by training Markarian began his political activities in the early 1970s when he joined a clandestine group campaigning for Armenias secession from the Soviet Union and spent two years in Soviet labor camps as a political prisoner He was among several members of that group who founded the HHK in 1989Markarian was elected chairman of the AMK in 1993 In 1996 he also joined the influential Yerkrapah union of veterans of the NagornoKarabakh war the organization whose parliament deputies triggered the resignation of President Levon TerPetrossian in February 1998 by withdrawing their support for himMarkarian was elected a parliament deputy in 1995 and again in 1999 Kocharian named him prime minister in May 2000 In that post he has presided over a period of doubledigit economic growth but has consistently adopted a tough line on such key issues as the NagornoKarabakh conflict and ArmenianTurkish relationsHe was appointed prime minister after effectively switching sides in a bitter power struggle that was sparked by the October 1999 attack on the Armenian parliament that killed eight politicians including Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian It ended in victory for Kocharian and SarkisianHe held on to the post in the shadow of Armenias two mostpowerful men rarely defying them on major policy issues and essentially putting the HHK at their disposalNobodys PerfectMarkarian defended his job as premier in an interview with RFERLs Armenian Service in DecemberI do not wish to say that there are no negative aspects in Armenia and that those negative aspects were eradicated during my premiership he said During my tenure we openly spoke about all the problems and shortcomings starting with poverty and the equal distribution of wealth We spoke openly about these things and we spoke more openly about these things than the opposition did We also battled corruption and we admitted there was much corruption and we needed to fight against it We did not only talk about these problems during meetings and parliamentary sessions We were saying there are problems and we are taking steps against themMarkarian was widely expected to resign as prime minister after the May 12 parliamentary elections Local observers have suggested that Sarkisian increasingly seen as the HHKs real top leader is keen to take up the post and use it as a launch pad for the Armenian presidency The question now is whether Sarkisian is willing to become premier before the vote It is also unclear whether he is Kocharians preferred candidate for the jobSpeaking to journalists in January Markarian  who became independent Armenias longestserving prime minister  effectively admitted that he will no longer head the government after elections When asked whether he is psychologically prepared to lose the job he said I think romantically but am a pragmatistBut he told RFERLs Armenian Service that criticism of his government is not necessarily a bad thingHis Death Complicates ElectionsIn every country there should be some discontent beginning in the United States and on through Europe he said Where can you say there is no discontent A country that has no discontent means it is totalitarianMarkarians sudden death is likely to exacerbate the rivalry in the runup to the May 12 parliamentary elections between Markarians HHK which has a majority in the outgoing legislature and the rival wouldbe party of power Prosperous Armenia which is headed by a wealthy oligarch with close ties to KocharianMeanwhile official Yerevan began receiving the first messages of condolences from foreign leaders Citing Kremlin officials the Regnum news agency reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin conveyed his sympathy to

Balkans predominantly ethnic Albanian territory of Kosovo could set a precedent for NagornoKarabakh which is located within Azerbaijan but has a mainly Armenian population  No Frozen Precedent Azimov spent much of his 45minute address to the European Parliaments South Caucasus delegation explaining why Kosovo should not serve as a precedent for NagornoKarabakh  The Kosovo issue is different from the Azerbaijani issue the AzerbaijaniArmenian conflict Azimov said In this conflict we have an open territorial claim by Armenia on Azerbaijan We have an open war that erupted in 1992 even earlier we had these military hostilities  Azimov also argued that territorial solutions should reflect the views of all sides in a conflict To do otherwise he said would undermine international law  Kosovos final status has yet to be decided A UN envoy former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has presented a plan that would grant Kosovo internationally supervised independence The EU has made clear it will not use a Kosovo resolution as a blueprint for any of the socalled frozen conflicts in the former Soviet UnionBut regardless of the final decision the EU has made clear it will not use a Kosovo resolution as a blueprint for any of the socalled frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union  Brussels says Kosovo is a unique case because it alone is administered by the United Nations  Most EU officials however appear to be accepting the realization that it may only be a matter of time before Kosovo becomes fully independent  and that other disputed regions may learn from its example  Hannes Swoboda a senior Socialist European deputy helped draft a parliament declaration on Kosovo He told Azimov he accepts the Azerbaijani argument that the issue of NagornoKarabakh is different from that of Kosovo  But he added both cases are similar in the sense that it may be too late to return to preconflict conditions Its a fact he suggested that all the governments involved should accept  I think Kosovo never will be part of Serbia again Swoboda said That time is over And I wonder if it is not good for Serbia to concentrate on their own issues And at the same time there may be some parallel here for NagornoKarabakh The question is not What is the legal point of view What is your right The legal point is clear  its an occupied territory But the question is what is the solution for the future that is good for Azerbaijan Armenia and the people in NagornoKarabakh  War Is Not Over Azimov for his part steadfastly defended the determination of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev not to give up NagornoKarabakh He said Armenia must allow Azeri refugees to return to the disputed enclave and the outlying occupied territories before talks on a resolution can hope to progress  The Azerbaijani deputy foreign minister also said Armenia may have technically won the battle that lead to the wars conclusion by ceasefire in 1994 But he added the war is not over  even if Baku is not threatening military aggression and prefers a negotiated solution  Azimov said Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart Robert Kocharian are planning to meet for talks on the issue soon after the May 12 parliamentary elections in Armenia  The Azerbaijani official also addressed an issue of growing significance for the EU  energy Acknowledging mounting alarm over the blocs dependence on Russian gas and oil Azimov promised his country would help the EU diversify its energy partners  Many European Parliament deputies attending todays meeting appealed to Azerbaijan to increase its support from the proposed Nabucco pipeline which would deliver Azerbaijani gas via Turkey to Austria and beyond Recent moves by Russia to create rival pipelines with Hungary and other EU countries have put Nabuccos future in doubt Azimov assured his hosts that Bakus interest in Nabucco remained firm and that the pipeline was not a dream But he said the EU itself must play a more assertive role in promoting energy transit from Central Asia across the Caspian Sea and onward via Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey  We signed last year a memorandum on energy partnership with the EU Azimov said But Im talking now about the further extension of this It is not only between Azerbaijan and the EU It is between Azerbaijan the European consuming nations the European transit nations and Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan

scrutiny will be more intense and expectations for a cleanvote  both within Armenia and abroad  are far higherBut the May ballot differs significantly from previous elections in two key respects scrutiny will be more intense and expectations for a clean vote  both within Armenia and abroad  are far higher Consequently the impact of this election on the trajectory of Armenian foreign policy and by extension on the future of the country will derive not so much from the composition of the new parliament as from the extent to which the election meets or fails to meet desired standards of fairness Confronting IsolationIf the ballot proves to be only the latest in a series of flawed and tainted elections the international response is likely to be both serious and swift And in that case the elections will go down in history not just as another lost opportunity for the development of real democracy in Armenia but as a move toward further regional isolationArmenia already has to contend with closed borders trade embargoes and exclusion from nearly all regional development projects including the planned KarsAkhalkalakiTbilisiBaku rail link Even with an impressive record of doubledigit economic growth Armenia still desperately needs greater connectivity and closer integration with the globalized marketplaceThe May 12 elections will be the first national ballot since Armenia signed its Action Plan with the European Union thereby officially committing itself to the European standards and values inherent in the new European Neighborhood Policy Visiting Armenia in early March EU Special Representative to the South Caucasus Peter Semneby openly warned Armenian officials that any problems with the election would be a lost opportunity for a firm relationship between Yerevan and Brussels Such strong language suggests that seriously flawed elections could result in a setback to the countrys evolving relationship with the EU thereby undermining Armenias position within the framework of the new EU plans for engagement in the region International PressureArmenia would also be further outpaced in a region that already shows signs of division and disparity Neighboring Georgia is already moving much faster and closer to Europe while Azerbaijan by virtue of its Caspian hydrocarbon reserves is of increasing strategic interest to an EU that is seeking to reduce its dependence on Russian gas imports  EU envoy Semneby warned of a lost opportunity RFERL file photoArmenias status as a beneficiary of the Millennium Challenge Account a new US foreign aid program that imposes important new prerequisites of democracy and electoral performance could similarly be jeopardized if international observers rate the May 12 ballot as less than free fair transparent and democratic In that case even Armenias politically active diaspora would be hardpressed to contain and overcome the ensuing damage to the countrys relationship with the United States Those ties are longstanding but cautious Armenia has sought to avoid any expansion in ties that could be perceived as upsetting or threatening its deeper and more prized strategic relationship with Russia Because of this any deterioration in USArmenian ties would only be exacerbated by the already limited scope of their bilateral relations The international communitys higher expectations for a clean vote are defined both by the objective need for improvements in Armenias tainted electoral record and by growing impatience over the fartoogradual development of democracy in the country The questionable constitutional referendum in late 2005 coming as it did after years of international assistance has led to a new reassessment and questioning of the sincerity of the Armenian governments commitment to democracy In this sense the international community will no longer be as patient or passive in the face of yet another flawed election in ArmeniaRegional SignificanceAt the same time the international community itself also faces a degree of pressure and expectation The international response to the Armenian elections will be watched intently as the Armenian contest is only the first in a cycle of both parliamentary and presidential elections in all three South Caucasus states in 200708 Regardless of the outcome of the May 12 elections there are likely to be few if any changes in current policies including participation in the ongoing talks mediated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE over the unresolved NagornoKarabakh conflict The Armenian political elite has become far too entrenched and has too much of a vested interest in the status quo to risk disturbing the slumbering apathy of Armenian society The real pivot for the Karabakh peace process may lie with next years Azerbaijani presidential election Although many consider the reelection of incumbent President Ilham Aliyev a foregone conclusion there is some degree of optimism that with such a newfound degree of legitimacy Aliyev may come to see a breakthrough on this frozen conflict as an appealing way to overcome the overbearing shadow of his late father and predecessor Yet that optimism should be qualified by the acknowledgement that neither side has adequately prepared its population for a Karabakh peace deal that would entail substantive concessionsRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by email subscribe to RFERL Caucasus Report

https://www.rferl.org/a/1075125.html,Armenia Parliamentary Ballot A New Twist On Deja Vu ,"March 07, 2007 15:38 GMT",,Now as then policy differences between the various parties are largely irrelevant with the main issue being whether the vote itself will prove free and fair But in contrast to 2003 far more depends this time around on both the conduct and the outcome of the vote  Perception Challenge Continued receipt of funds under the US Millennium Challenge program and mediumterm cooperation with the EU are both contingent on the voting being perceived as free and fair In addition the political landscape has changed in recent years reflecting the emergence of powerful new players the shift of one former influential politician to the opposition and the oppositions seeming inability to close ranks  Finally the outcome of the ballot  specifically which party gains a majority in the new legislature and who becomes prime minister  will to a large extent shape the outcome of the presidential ballot in early 2008 in which incumbent President Robert Kocharian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term It is widely believed that the main competition will be not between progovernment forces and the opposition but between two proKocharian groupingsFor months opposition politicians have been predicting that like earlier ballots the May 12 election will be criticized by international monitors as not meeting generally accepted standards for a free fair and democratic vote  Two factors have served to fuel those misgivings The first is the spectacular rise in popularity of a new party Bargavach Hayastan BH Prosperous Armenia formed just over one year ago by Gagik Tsarukian a wealthy businessman with close personal ties to Kocharian  BH claims to have signed up 370000 members which is tantamount to over 10 percent of the countrys total 322 million population Its critics allege that its success is largely the result of the charitable activities undertaken by an eponymous foundation also headed by Tsarukian A poll of 1200 respondents conducted by the Armenian Sociological Association in November 2006 found that Tsarukian was by far the most popular person in Armenia  The second is President Kocharians listing during a December 15 television interview of those parties that he believes will dominate the next parliament namely the HHK BH on the basis of what he termed its simple and understandable slogans and the HHKs two current coalition partners the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD and the United Labor Party MAK headed by businessman Gurgen Arsenian  President Kocharian affirmed in his televised New Years address to the nation that I am sure that the elections will be up to the mark RFERLs Armenian Service reported on January 3 Free and fair elections should be a priority for each of us he added Defense Minister Sergzh Sarkisian for his part similarly pledged on February 4 that both he personally and the Armenian authorities as a whole will make every effort to ensure that the elections are democratic fair and transparent regnumru reported  Apprehensive Opposition But few opposition politicians place any trust in such assertions and some even suspect that the international community does not consider it imperative that the election is fair  Artur Baghdasarian who quit as parliament speaker in May 2006 after a public disagreement with Kocharian over whether Armenia should aspire to NATO membership described the election campaign in an editorial published last month in the The Wall Street Journal as a crossroads and argued that Armenia needs a strong and legitimate government supported by the people in order to implement the reforms on which political and economic progress is contingent  He called on the international community to support the OSCE election monitoring mission and thus undercut those abroad who might turn a blind eye to voterigging in the name of preserving stability  On March 5 Lieutenant General Manvel Grigorian who heads Yerkrapah the largest union of veterans of the Karabakh war was even more outspoken estimating the chances of election fraud as 100 percent given that there are lots of professionals around RFERLs Armenian Service reported He vowed to make every effort to minimize falsification in those singlemandate constituencies where the Yerkrapah will field candidates    The outcome of the May ballot could help determine who will replace President Robert Kocharian next year epaManukian onetime prime minister and defense minister and three times a presidential challenger similarly commented in late January that only idiots believe that the May 12 vote will be free and fair  The Armenian press is moreover replete with speculation about imputed agreements already reached within the upper echelons of the present leadership on the allocation of the proportional vote  This time a larger number of parliament mandates than ever before will be allocated under the proportional system 90 of the total 131 By contrast in 2003 the ratio was 7556 and in 1999 the reverse with 56 seats allocated under the proportional system and 75 in singlemandate constituencies  Hayk predicted on February 9 that BH will win 38 percent of the vote the HHK 31 percent the HHD 9 percent and the opposition 8 percent Kocharian is said to be disappointed already in Arsenians MAK  ProPresidential Contest That scenario reflects the widely held conviction that the main competition will be not between progovernment forces and the opposition but between two proKocharian groupings Tsarukians BH and the HHK within which Defense Minister Serge Sarkisian is poised to eclipse Markarian as the most powerful figure Most pundits anticipate that should the HHK emerge as the election winner Sarkisian would become prime minister with Markarian given the post of parliament speaker  Faced with the twin challenges posed by BHs capacity  courtesy of Tsarukians virtually unlimited financial resources  to buy votes and the imputed determination of the Armenian leadership to ensure victory for a party or parties loyal to the present leadership the logical course of action would seem to have been for disparate opposition parties to subsume their differences and rivalries and align if not in a united front then in two or three blocs There is a precedent for doing so several opposition parties aligned to back Manukians presidential bid in September 1996One major putative alliance would have brought together Stepan Demirchians Peoples Party of Armenia HZhK Manukians National Democratic Union AZhM the Zharangutiun Heritage party of USborn former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian and the Hanrapetutiun Republic Party headed by another former premier Aram Sargsian Earlier speculation that Sargsian would join forces with Artashes Geghamians National Accord Party proved misplacedSome in the opposition question whether the international community values free and fair elections more than stabilityHowever on February 28 the leaders of those parties publicly admitted their failure to overcome their differences without specifying the sticking points Suren Sureniants of Hanrapetutiun told RFERL without elaborating on February 27 that the disagreements were not ideological but tactical while Sargsian implied to RFERLs Armenian Service the following day that he suspected some of his potential allies of colluding with the authorities  Baghdasarians Orinats Yerkir was said at one point to be considering an alliance with Dashink which is headed by the former commander of the NagornoKarabakh armed forces General Samvel Babayan but those expectations too proved misplaced  Moreover not only did Armenias most prominent opposition parties fail to cement a broad election alliance the tactical differences that emerged between them dealt the coup de grace to the Artarutiun alliance of 12 opposition parties formed in the wake of the 2003 presidential elections and which won 23 mandates in the parliamentary election later that same year  The leaders of its constituent parties pronounced Artarutiun defunct on March 2 but again declined to offer any explanation RFERLs Armenian Service reported According to some media reports the remaining parties objected to Demirchians insistence that his HZhK should nominate at least half the candidates on the blocs joint list and that the bloc back him as its sole candidate in the 2008 presidential ballot  Parties Divided Consequently a total of 27 separate political parties plus one bloc have formally announced their intention to compete for the 90 parliament mandates to be distributed under the proportional system  The sole major party that did not do so is Manukians AZhM Manukian who is 61 told RFERL in a telephone interview on March 5 that since mechanisms for concealing vote falsification have become quite sophisticated even a broadbased opposition alliance would have been hardpressed to win a majority in the new parliament In those circumstances he continued being a deputy of this and the next parliament is neither honorable nor does it make any sense At the same time he insisted that we are not quitting politics and he made clear that he intends to nominate his candidacy in next years presidential ballot  The one election bloc that will seek registration brings together two small parties sympathetic to former President Levon TerPetrossian Democratic Homeland headed by Petros Makeyan and Mikael Hairapetians Conservative Party  The former Aylntranq Alternative now goes by the English name Impeachment and seeks to impeach President Kocharian on what grounds is unclear according to Article 57 of the constitution the president can be impeached only for high treason or unspecified grave crimes Aylntranq is reportedly attracting younger voters and defectors from both Zharangutiun and Manukians AZhM  The various party lists number 1497 candidates with the HHK and BH each naming 112 candidates the HHD 117 Orinats Yerkir 131 the HZhK 69 and Zharangutiun 56 A total of 173 candidates have been nominated to contest the remaining 41 parliament mandates Noyan Tapan reported on March 5  Of the 131 outgoing parliament deputies 80 percent have nominated themselves for the May 12 ballot either under the proportional or majoritarian system or both according to Noyan Tapan on March 7RFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North

https://www.rferl.org/a/1075112.html,World US Official Discusses Rights Issues In Russia Caucasus ,"March 07, 2007 08:24 GMT",,RFERL US President George W Bush often speaks highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin How did Putins Russia stand on human rights last yearJeff Krilla 2006 was a bad year for Russia in terms of human rights One of the things we do in our human rights report is not only talk about the human rights conditions in each country on the planet but we talk about trajectory And unfortunately when we talk about trajectory one of the biggest backsliders weve seen  certainly in terms of Europe  has been Russia And its very disconcerting to those of us who follow human rights issues We see government accountability to the people decreasing through a continued concentration of power in the Kremlin We see increased restrictions on NGOs declined media freedoms and certainly the harassment and killing of journalists has been particularly troubling to those of us that continue to promote media freedoms as fundamental to any democratic societyRFERL What about Russias record in Chechnya  and the record of those who oppose Russia thereKrilla One of the things that we have done as US officials has been to stress to Russian officials our support for a political rather than a military solution in Chechnya Weve urged an end to human rights abuses by all parties to the conflict and accountability for abuses that occur and that have occurred Weve urged cooperation with the international community on humanitarian economic and stability issues So weve worked very hard on the Chechnya issue and certainly met frequently with human rights NGOs to discuss the situation on the ground in Chechnya and to show support for their very hard workRFERL Westerners watched the 2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine with great optimism a little more than two years ago How is Ukraine faring nowKrilla One of the things that I do want to stress is that we have seen the situation in Ukraine improve The fact that the March 2006 parliamentary elections were the most open and honest in Ukraines history is a huge step forward for the country And Ukraine has continued to show improvement in press freedom freedom of association and development of civil society   ProMoscow Chechen security forces caught on film abusing a civilian courtesy photoFor those that would argue that the luster has worn off of the Orange Revolution I would argue that a lot of the lasting effects of the Orange Revolution are in place and in fact have been consolidated Were not in the business of picking winners and losers in terms of these elections The fact that elections are up to internationally recognized standards is whats critical to us and to other democratic countries that work to promote human rights and democracyRFERL And what of GeorgiaKrilla Georgias another country that we see having a very positive trajectory although for all the improvement that weve seen recently there are serious problems that remain in certain areas There are reports of deaths due to excessive use of force by law enforcement officers cases of torture and mistreatment of detainees increased abuses of prisoners overuse of pretrial detention and certainly concerns about worsening conditions in detention facilities But we still have seen a lot of progress the last couple of years have been very positive in Georgia overall but I think we continue  in these human rights reports  to focus on the conditions across the society across all the institutions And certainly I noted a number of areas that Georgia could show increased improvement that were focused on in our bilateral relations with the GeorgiansRFERL How is the human rights situation in Armenia which has tilted more to Moscow than the West since the breakup of the Soviet UnionKrilla Weve got an election coming up in Armenia this year in April but I think the human rights conditions continue to remain poor There are credible reports that law enforcement officials engaged in arbitrary arrests and detention and abuse of detainees Theres a lot of concern from our perspective of ruleoflaw issues in Armenia And certainly media freedom is not what it could be The government has restricted freedom of speech and the press and I might even note  through a very unusual move  lawmakers rejected a governmentsponsored bill that would have further restricted media activities There is still an opposition in that we see having some sort of force to try and keep the checks and balances in the government in place But overall media freedom and ruleoflaw issues are of concern to us I will also add two other areas of concern Religious freedom Government and overall Armenian society continue to view minority religious groups with suspicion Although they are allowed to operate I think this is something that bears watching And secondly trafficking in persons Trafficking in persons for purposes of sexual and labor exploitation continued to be a problem in 2006 although the government did pass legislation that toughened penalties for trafficking  something else that bears attention I think in the futureRFERL And what of Armenias neighbor AzerbaijanKrilla The human rights conditions in Azerbaijan remained poor in 2006 The government continued to imprison persons for politically motivated reasons and restrictions on freedom of media freedom of assembly and political participation worsened Now there were some improvements in the period leading up to the November 2005 parliamentary elections but the May 13 partial reruns in 10 of the races in Azerbaijan failed to meet a number of international standards So I think were going to keep an eye on the situation there   Squalid conditions in a Georgian prison in March 2006 InterpressnewsOur report is very comprehensive for the conditions in 2006 but certainly elections have been troubling in recent years in Azerbaijan And weve seen restrictions on freedom of the press increase and harassment and violence against journalists have continued Freedom of assembly has been a problem in Azerbaijan Restrictions on freedom of assembly have worsened the government has often denied opposition parties requests simply to hold political rallies And then on the issues of religious freedom and trafficking in persons Religious freedom issues the government of Azerbaijan generally respected religious freedom but did restrict it for some Muslim groups on grounds that these groups were radical or fundamentalist  something else that I think bears attention And then in terms of trafficking in persons Id actually say this is a bright spot for the government of Azerbaijan The governments taken several important steps to combat trafficking in persons and I think wed like to see that trend continue as wellRFERL Finally the former Yugoslavia  specifically Serbia How has it fared since breaking with MontenegroKrilla I think we did note in our human rights report for 2006 that the government of Serbia generally respected the human rights of its citizens but we did note numerous problems that persisted Corruption in the police and the judiciary was a problem in 2006 there still continues to be inefficient and lengthy trials Theres been a failure to cooperate with the ICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in apprehending war crimes suspects Theres ongoing harassment of journalists human rights workers and others critical of the government and weve seen arbitrary arrests and selective enforcement of the law for political purposes Following the May 21 referendum of last year we did see a very peaceful dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro and I think the Serbians  and the Montenegrins  can be praised for that peaceful transition that we saw thereUN Human Rights CouncilUN General Assembly delegates applaud the creation of the UN Human Rights Council on March 15 2006 epaA FRESH START ON

https://www.rferl.org/a/1074608.html,World Central Asian Iranian Recordings Compete For World Music Grammy ,"February 09, 2007 14:00 GMT",,But most traditional music from outside North America and Europe is grouped into a Western marketing category known as World Music Thus Central Asian maqam is competing in the same category as a South African gospel choir classical Hindustani musicians a Scandinavianstyled trio and a live recording of Iranian and Armenian masters It was September of 2003 when Iranian lute virtuoso Hossein Alizadeh teamed up with Armenian duduk master Djivan Gasparyan for a live outdoor concert at Tehrans Niavaran PalacePersian And ArmenianThis year a recording of that show is one of five Grammy Award nominees for Best Traditional World Music Album It is being marketed in the west under the title Endless Vision Persian and Armenian SongsAlizadeh is a renowned composer and a master of the tar He also is a master of other traditional instruments in the Persian lute family But ironically the Tehran concert that earned him and Gasparyan a Grammy nomination was far from traditionalInstead of the Iranian tar Alizadeh plays a new kind of Iranian lute called a shurangiz  an instrument that he has helped designMeanwhile Alizadehs collaborations with Gasparyan explore new artistic territory by blending classical Persian music and poetry with Armenian and Azeri melodies and lyrics sung by Gasparyan  Iranian lute virtuoso Hossein AlizadehTwo women  Afsaneh Rasaei and Khourshid Biabani  also sing as part of Alizadehs otherwise allmale Hamavayan EnsembleAnd Gasparyan adds his instrumental mastery on the duduk  a cylindrical wooden flute made from the root of an apricot treeBorn in the the village of Solag near Yerevan Gasparyan was honored in 1973 by the Armenian government with the title of Peoples Artist of Armenia But he is perhaps best known in the West for his performances on major motionpicture soundtracks like Gladiator and Martin Scorseses Last Temptation of ChristReviving ShashmaqamAnother Grammy nominee this year for Best Traditional World Music Album is a project that documents attempts by Tajik and Uzbek musicians to revive shashmaqam  a style of court music that flourished centuries ago in Central AsiaThe album is called Invisible Face Of The Beloved Classical Music of the Tajiks and Uzbeks It is part of a project by the Agha Khan Music Initiative in Central Asia that has been distributed by the Smithsonian Folkways label Documentary filmmaker and Central Asian music expert Simon Broughton says Shashmaqam is gaining popularity among Westerners But he says listeners must be educated about the music to appreciate its depthWithin the Asian region I think Central Asia is attracting some attention Broughton says Theyve got to work a little bit in bringing their music across There are aspects of Central Asian music like the Sashmaqam tradition  the classical music tradition of Bukhara and Samarkand  which is a very erudite tradition It is one that you really do need to get accustomed to in order to find your way through itEducating Western listeners is exactly what the Grammynominated album attempts to do with its detailed 44page booklet and documentary film on a bonus DVD The music on the album is performed by students from the Academy of Maqam in Dushanbe Abduvali Abdurashidov the schools founder and director explains the history of the musicMaqam was performed at the court of the ruling emirs Abdurashidov says Generation after generation for hundreds of years it was transmitted from master to disciple It went through many changes on the way to acquiring its present form Maqam music doesnt have a composer Its composer is the peopleSeeking To Achieve TruthAbdurashidov says that when he opened the music academy in 2003 it was modeled on ideals of Islamic learning that are even older than Shashmaqam Those standards make the study of music inseparable from the study of poetry rhythmic verse metaphysics ethics and aesthetics  Academy of Maqam is trying to revive shashmaqamOur maqams have a meaning that is mystical and Sufi Abdurashidov says Maqam seeks to achieve truth This perfection is an aim We have to go through hundreds of levels and difficulties to reach it In a maqam these levels are represented by various stages of musical development It is like a persons movement toward spiritual perfection A feeling that grows little by little toward a culmination And it arrives at the awj  the highest culmination It is a moment when the meaning of poetry and music arrives at a supreme point and bursts through to create a particular spiritual stateThe students at the academy have delved deeply into the relation between poetry and musical rhythm  studying the tuning the structure of maqam compositions and the overall form of the song cycles In this way Abdurashidov says the students are able to perform Sashmaqam in a way that hasnt been done since the 19th centuryThe three other albums nominated for Best Traditional World Music Album feature music from Asia Africa and EuropeHambo In The Snow features a Washingtonbased trio that styles its performances after ancient Scandinavian musicBlessed is an album from South Africa performed by the Soweto Gospel ChoirGolden Strings of The Sarode is a collection of Hindustani

RFERL correspondent Ogulsapar Muradova who died in prison in September 2006 but we also have got no news from two other colleagues of Ogulsapar Muradova who were arrested and convicted in the same trial last August As we have no news from them we are pretty worried and fearing that the worst has happened to themRFERL How about UzbekistanVidal In Uzbekistan we have seen the disappearance of almost all foreign media on Uzbek soil and we know that most of the human rights defenders are forced to work clandestinely Very recently we have also learned about the arrest of an opposition journalist a prominent journalist Umida Niyazova and its unfortunately not the first  and we are quite convinced that it wont be the last to be arrested under false reasonsRFERL Your report calls the situation in Russia grim and highlights the killing of journalist Anna Politkovskaya It also says that in Belarus more pressure was put on media outlets offering a voice to or even mentioning the existence of the political opposition How much worse is the situation in these countries compared to previous yearsVidal What we have seen in Russia and Belarus is a tightening grip on the administrative and financial means of media control Of course there has also been a burst of violence in Russia against journalists  three of them were murdered last year including of course Anna Politkovskaya But in Russia we are most worried about the spreading of violence in all society  a trend that affects also the security of journalists But both in Belarus and in Russia we have seen last year an attempt to get firm control on the all the means of production and distribution of newspapers and of all the free pressRFERL In the Caucasus your report singles out Azerbaijan where it says that 2006 was a dark year for the media Could you explain whyVidal The main problems in the Caucasus are from our point of view in Azerbaijan Although the country experiences a real economic boom we know that in Azerbaijan this tremendous growth doesnt benefit the free press and there has been a real temptation on the side of President Ilham Aliyev to silence the opposition and the press that is linked to this opposition But what we want to underline in Azerbaijan is also that there is a growing use of abduction and aggression against journalists that are mainly investigating corruption casesRFERL How about neighboring ArmeniaVidal Armenia is far less violent for journalists compared with Azerbaijan and the problems that we have witnessed are much more linked to the difficulty for some journalists to raise geopolitical problems so it is much more a problem of censorship It is worrying but compared with Azerbaijan it is really not on the same levelPress Under AssaultAFPBREAKING

https://www.rferl.org/a/1074236.html,Council Of Europe Armenians Azerbaijanis Taking Governments To Court ,"January 23, 2007 15:41 GMT",,The court in January has delivered two landmark rulings against the governments of Armenia and AzerbaijanIn October 2003 masked police officers in the Azerbaijani capital Baku burst into the home of Sardar Calaloglu aka Jalaloglu a leading opposition figure  Calaloglu was arrested in connection with a street rally held two days earlier to protest presidential election results handing Ilham Aliyev  the son of the outgoing president Heydar Aliyev  an easy win The protest had turned violent and left one dead Violent Repercussions  While in police custody Calaloglu says he was beaten with truncheons tortured and threatened with rape A medical report confirmed he had been repeatedly hit with a hard blunt object He was left temporarily disabled Although Calaloglu was not present at the protest rally an Azerbaijani court sentenced him to three years in prison on charges of organizing public disorderHe was released early by presidential pardon But Calaloglu was determined to seek redress Calaloglu says he was beaten with truncheons tortured and threatened with rape while in police custodyOn January 11 more than three years after his ordeal the European Court of Human Rights found Azerbaijani authorities guilty of mistreating Jalaloglu and failing to adequately investigate his complaints of illtreatment The court awarded Calaloglu 11817 euros 15275 in damages and expenses  It was only the second time the Strasbourg court had handed down a decision against Azerbaijan But Calaloglu said he hopes the cases will jumpstart the fight against officially sanctioned torture in his country This is actually the first case proving that torture takes place in Azerbaijani detention centers Calaloglu told RFERLs Azerbaijani Service This creates a precedent Now all complaints about torture in Azerbaijan will be considered more quickly and more seriously This proves that torture is a method commonly used by Azerbaijani lawenforcement organs Calaloglu is not the only Azerbaijani to turn to the European Court of Human Rights In fact more than 600 applications for potential cases against Azerbaijan are currently pending in Strasbourg The court which has been functioning in its current form for nearly a decade was created to systematize the way human rights complaints are brought against states parties to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1950  The court has 46 judges each representing  although not necessarily from  an individual memberstate of the Council of Europe Its a modest number considering that each year the court can face as many as 50000 applications for potential cases ranging from libel and antiterrorism issues to police abuse and illegal detention Only a fraction of those applications will end in hearings but the process of elimination is so timeconsuming that it can be many years before some cases are finally heard  Wealth Of Cases Many of those applications are coming from countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States that are now members of the Council of Europe Russia Ukraine Moldova Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia  Olga Vishnyovskaya a Russian lawyer at the court says this is largely the result of failed judicial systems in former Soviet states Nearly all applicants who turn to the court say there is no efficient means to defend their rights within the country Vishnyovskaya said Many of the applicants feel so much distrust toward Russian authorities that they dont even file a case with them before filing it with us Russia files the most complaints with the human rights court but the others have substantially boosted the number of applications to the court In 2006 Georgia had 112 Moldova 641 and Ukraine 4146The main purpose of my application was to show our judges and leaders that they must honor their obligations to the Council of Europe  Armenian opposition figure MkrtchyanStrasbourg is also receiving a steady stream of complaints from Armenia with 250 applications lodged last year That number is expected to swell even further following the courts firstever judgment handed down January 11 against the Armenian authorities  The court ruled that Armenian authorities violated the principle of freedom of assembly by arresting Armen Mkrtchyan a former member of the countrys opposition Republic Party Armenian PrecedentMkrtchyan was detained in May 2002 during a street rally organized by his party A Yerevan court later sentenced him to a small fine Mkrtchyan says his legal victory sets an important precedent for Armenia The main purpose of my application was to show our judges and leaders that they must honor their obligations to the Council of Europe Mkrtchyan told RFERLs Armenian Service They will now be more cautious One could say that Ive paved the way for similar legal challenges against violations committed in our countryRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by

https://www.rferl.org/a/1074207.html,ArmeniaTurkey Journalists Killing Dampens Optimism Of Breakthrough ,"January 22, 2007 13:40 GMT",But following the January 19 assassination in Istanbul of prominent TurkishArmenian writer and editor Hrant Dink January too has assumed significance,But following the January 19 assassination in Istanbul of prominent TurkishArmenian writer and editor Hrant Dink January too has assumed significance Death Of Opportunity The death of the 53yearold Dink who was gunned down on the steps of the editorial office of his newspaper Agos is more than simply a tragic killing Its significance lies first in its timing The killing coincided with a new sense of optimism as a significant segment of opinion on both the Turkish and Armenian sides appeared to be poised for a breakthrough in the diplomatic deadlock between Ankara and Yerevan  This most recent initiative included a new consideration of measures aimed at easing Turkeys longstanding closure of its borders with Armenia and seeking to move each country closer to formal diplomatic relations  Ironically there has been a new impetus for reconsidering possible trade relations with Armenia among the most unlikely of circles  the senior Turkish military leadership That impetus has stemmed first from a realization in Ankara that the blockade and embargo imposed on Armenia in 1993 in order both to demonstrate solidarity with Azerbaijan and to pressure the Armenian government over NagornoKarabakh have failed The slow pace of negotiations on finding a resolution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict has limited Turkish policy  Moreover there was a related recognition that Turkish foreign policy has become far too limited and hostage to Azerbaijan with little room for innovation and even less for Ankara to seek new policy options  Those limitations on Turkish policy were further enhanced by the stalemate in mediation talks aimed at negotiating a resolution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict That stalemate compounded mounting Turkish frustration over the burden of subordinating its strategic approach to the region to serving Azerbaijani interests rather than to meeting Turkish needs Additionally this impetus came in response to the twin threats posed by the rise of a Kurdish protostate in northern Iraq and a resurgence of Kurdish nationalism in the eastern regions of Turkey  Thus opening the Turkish border with Armenia was seen as an effective way to stabilize and economically develop the Kurdishpopulated areas along the TurkishArmenian border And given the longstated Armenian offer of normal diplomatic relations without preconditions there was a convergence of interests between Turkish military and commercial interests with each sensing an advantage in forging economic ties with Armenia Forward Thinking The killing of Dink is also significant in that it reflects a much deeper struggle under way in Turkey today that reflects a dynamic reassessment of both Turkish identity and Turkish secularism Moreover the past few years have seen profound shifts in public opinion in Turkey as debate and discourse have become polarizedby conflicting visions of Turkeys strategic orientation  Within this deeper context of internal change Dink played an important role in contributing to the debate about Turkeys future orientationAs a strong advocate of Turkish membership in the European Union Dink represented the Westernlooking segment of the Turkish political and intellectual elite    Dinks death has Armenians mourning epaAs with the bilingual nature of the Armenian and Turkish newspaper that he edited Dink personified the duality of Turkish identity  seeing himself as much Turkish as Armenian and declaring his commitment to improving relations between Turks and Armenians Dink once broke down during an interview with AP decrying what he termed as the hatred that some Turks held for him adding that he could not stay in a country where he was unwanted Dinks life as a Turkish citizen reveals as much about the internal changes taking place in Turkey today as does his death  In this respect the murder of Dink was more than simply a fatal attack on an ethnic Armenian it was the killing of a prominent Turkish citizen And Dinks life as a Turkish citizen reveals as much about the internal changes taking place in Turkey today as does his death  Specifically Dink was individually engaged in his own contribution to the debate over Turkeys future boldly asserting the historical veracity of the Armenian genocide in the face of threats and intimidation As part of this effort he was convicted in 2005 of insulting Turkish identity on the basis of an article in which he wrote of the 1915 genocide of Ottoman Armenians and was given a sixmonth suspended sentence in October 2005 for his boldness  Both his persecution and prosecution demonstrate the difficult choices facing Turkey on its road to EU membership well beyond the confines of the Armenia issue  Chance For Change However as tragic as the murder was it may nonetheless present a new opportunity for Turkey to recognize the futility of the socalled taboo on such issues as the Kurdish question and the Armenian genocide Addressing these two core issues represents more than a question of Turkey confronting with its past but would actually serve to define Turkeys future  Judging by the swift and strident official reaction to the murder with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemning the killing as a bullet fired against free speech and democracy there is some hope that Dink may ultimately achieve more in death to change Turkey from within than he could ever have accomplished in his lifetime  But the challenge to transform this tragedy into a true turning point for Turkey hinges on the need for Ankara to adopt a new farsighted approach toward both Turkeys past and its futureRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis

totalRFERL In your opinion will the OSCE be able to maintain this performance in 2007De Gucht We are now succeeded by Spain by my friend Miguel Angel Moratinos who is an excellent diplomat People sometimes say that I am not a diplomat that he is a career diplomat while Im a politician Im absolutely convinced that he will be an excellent chairman in officeRFERL What do you think will happen if Kazakhstan takes over the presidency in 2009De Gucht One must look at the decision we made in Brussels at the December ministerial meeting which I consider a wise decision We said Kazakhstan was eligible Every presidency however must meet the same criteria with regard to guaranteeing democracy the principles of the OSCEs charter etcWe also acknowledge the fact that Kazakhstan will in coming months submit a program for democratic reform On the basis of the evaluation of this program and its implementation we will make a decision on the 2009 presidency at the next ministerial meeting in MadridRFERL Lets go back to your presidency You initially announced that searching for solutions to the frozen conflicts in the CIS was a priority for the OSCE But these conflicts including Transdniester and South Ossetia remain far from being resolved Do you see this as a failure of the OSCEDe Gucht This is certainly not a failure of the OSCE The OSCEs sole function is to be an honest broker to try to encourage the interested parties to find agreements In South Ossetia it is true that there has been a referendum but we havent recognized it and the international community has not recognized this referendum either On the other hand there has been a conference of donors for the rehabilitation of South Ossetia We visited South Ossetia and I think that with the means we were able to gather we can rehabilitate South Ossetia And that changes the facts on the groundIt is true that with regard to Transdniester and South Ossetia we are currently unable to resolve these frozen conflicts for one simple reason Russia doesnt want to solve these problems now And I dont have any levers that could force Russia to do it I am convinced that the frozen conflict that is potentially the most dangerous is NagornoKarabakh If we fail to find a solution sooner or later it will pose very serious problemsRFERL What about Chechnya The OSCE appears to be ignoring this conflict This is all the more surprising since the OSCE monitored the 1997 elections that brought Aslan Maskhadov to power and declared them free and fair Since these elections the OSCE has remained tightlipped on ChechnyaDe Gucht We made several attempts at convincing the Russian authorities to allow the OSCE to operate in Chechnya but we didnt get permission from Russia We cant force it I am in favor of a mission in Chechnya I was even ready to make serious concessions in order to be able to resume our activities in this region But Russias refusal was totalWhat Comes After The ReferendumsRussian President Vladimir Putin at his presidential residence outside of Moscow in July TASSEXPANSION PLANS Russia is well equipped  at least constitutionally  to absorb breakaway republics like Transdniester Abzhazia and South Ossetia into its federation  In 2001 on the initiative of Russias presidential administration the Duma approved a law that allows the Russian Federation to absorb not only foreign states but also their parts This includes entities that have no physical borders with Russia for example Transdniester  The law however stipulates that the territorial exchanges can be done only after legal agreement with the central government of the country to which the breakaway territory belongs  Since the law was passed various deputies and bodies have tried to change the legislation in order to make it easier for Russia to incorporate foreign territories In July 2004 Andrei Kokoshin the chairman of a Duma committee on links with CIS and other foreign countries asked the Supreme Court what would be the quickest way of Russia legally absorbing South Ossetia The court ruled that incorporating South Ossetian territory into the Russian Federation could only be done in talks with the Georgian government  In 2005 the Duma rejected proposals from the nationalist Motherland party that Russia could incorporate foreign territory based only on the will of a local population By this logic Russia with its interethnic problems could also become the victim of similar tactics from neighboring states For example in Finland Estonia and Latvia there are public groups making claims on Russian territory So what is Moscow likely to do after the referendums in Transdniester and South Ossetia First it will begin a campaign to get international legal recognition of the results of the polls Second it will recognize the results of the referendums and encourage its allies in the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS to do the same It could also feasibly incorporate them in the CIS Or unite them in a kind of miniCIS2 The leaders of Transdniester South Ossetia and Abkhazia have already formed under Russian patronage an alliance of unrecognized states and signed an agreement of mutual political and military support  And Moscow is also likely to encourage its own internal regions which are not subject to international law to recognize the breakaway regions For example Yury Luzhkov the mayor of Moscow recently said that Moscow recognizes South Ossetia and Abzhazia

most fundamental issues,Most key issues pitted the United States against Russia and divisions ran deep on the most fundamental issuesSpeaking shortly before the end of the meeting today US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns outlined a vision of the OSCE as a body with a continued strong mission to promote democracy and defend human rights The OSCE gives objective straight advice about democracy human rights electoral practices One of the key challenges facing all of us in the EuroAtlantic community is How can young democracies in the Balkans in Central Europe in the Caucasus and in Central Asia become fully fledged democracies he said And the OSCE is the most important institution available to all of us the most effective arm of the EuroAtlantic community because it is an objective observer of elections It gives objective straight advice about democracy human rights electoral practicesDiffering VisionsA key test of that vision was the debate on a draft declaration on strengthening the effectiveness of the OSCE which emphasized the importance of the mission Burns outlined Burns noted today that Russia was the last country to block the adoption of the textThe previous day Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had taken issue with that vision saying it was imbalanced judgmental and didnt address current concernsRussia has long resented what it sees as the OSCEs meddling in the affairs of the postSoviet successor states Lavrov said the OSCE risks irrelevance if it does not start tackling global threats like terrorism and the drug tradeA declaration on OSCE effectiveness was finally adopted on December 5 Russia showed its displeasure by blocking another text that would have committed OSCE member states to the protection of domestic human rights activists and nongovernmental organizations NGOsThe outgoing OSCE chairman in office Belgian Foreign Minister Karel de Gucht did not hide his disappointment saying that I can only regret that an important decision on human rights defenders was blocked De Gucht noted in his closing remarks that a vast majority of OSCE members believe they should protect human rights defendersOverall de Gucht tried to strike a positive note saying he hopes the OSCE has put an end to the phase of introspection  a reference to the years in which member states have spent arguing about the organizations future roleGoing In CirclesOn issues of substance however there was little evidence to support this hope as divisions followed the same basic patternUS Undersecretary Burns noted the profound disagreement between the United States and Russia on the latters treatment of Georgia and Moldova Burns said he regretted Russias decision to block agreement of declarations on conflicts in both countries  De Gucht said there was only circular movement with respect to separatist conflicts in Georgia and Moldova RFERL file photoHe also made it plain that the United States believes Russia has failed to honor its commitments before the OSCEUnfortunately there will be no agreedupon language in the final document on Georgia and Moldova he said I think the great majority of countries here have called upon Russia to meet its Istanbul commitments made in 1999  to withdraw their remaining military equipment from Moldova to withdraw their troops from Georgia These two countries deserve to be fully independent and fully sovereign and the United States will continue to support them in that rightOSCE Chairman De Gucht also noted that 2006 had only produced circular movement with respect to conflicts in Georgia and Moldova He said tensions had run high during discussions of these issues and warned that the OSCEs credibility had been damaged as a result De Gucht cited an absence of political will calling for mutual concessions and saying no one should be angling for an all or nothing outcome He warned that resorting to force would not bring sustainable solutionsKazakh Leadership BidThe OSCE meeting noted some progress in NagornoKarabakh but there were no signs of an impending breakthroughDe Gucht praised the OSCEs outgoing Belgian chairmanship for swiftly defusing the controversy surrounding Kazakhstans bid to lead the OSCE in 2009 He said the decision was deferred until November next year and is now subject to democratic reforms which Kazakhstan has promised to undertake So the link between these two elements does seem to be very important he addedThe United States led efforts to persuade Kazakhstan to accept a later date but appeared actively engaged behind the scenes to reach a compromise after Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev on December 4 vowed not to back downUndersecretary Burns indicated on December 5 that US officials had had good contacts

https://www.rferl.org/a/1073155.html,Caucasus Azerbaijani Armenian Karabakh Officials Assess Talks ,"December 01, 2006 14:29 GMT",Armenia is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2007 Both Armenia and Azerbaijan will hold presidential elections in 2008,Armenia is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2007 Both Armenia and Azerbaijan will hold presidential elections in 2008In the runup to those ballots the cochairs reason the two countries leaders will be reluctant to agree on the serious mutual compromises that a settlement will inevitably necessitate Consequently a sense of urgency has imbued successive meetings this year between either the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers or the two countries presidents The meeting in Minsk on November 28 between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev was thus widely perceived as the last chance for some time to reach even a preliminary agreementComments On Azerbaijani TVThe two presidents did not issue any formal statement after their meeting in Minsk But Aliyev told Azerbaijani National Television on November 29 that since the socalled Prague process talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers on approaches to resolving the conflict began the negotiating process has gone through several stages We are approaching the final stage he said The first Prague talks took place in April 2004 and Aliyev has met with Kocharian seven times since then the Minsk meeting was their third this yearAliyev said the Minsk talks were held in a constructive way and that we managed to a find a solution to a number of problems we could not agree on before He added however that divergences remain on crucial points and that further progress depends on us ourselves presumably meaning the conflict sides as opposed to the Minsk Group Position UnchangedAliyev stressed that Azerbaijans negotiating position remains unchanged insofar as any solution must preserve Azerbaijans territorial integrity He further stressed that Azerbaijani displaced persons whose number he said exceeds 1 million compared with UNHCR estimates of 800000 must be enabled to return to their homes Aliyev also said the four resolutions on NagornoKarabakh adopted by the UN Security Council in 1993 and which call for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory must be fulfilled He said the population of NagornoKarabakh must be provided with the highest form of selfgovernment possible within Azerbaijan The constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic defines the Nakhichevan Republic as an autonomous republic within the Azerbaijan Republic with its own parliament but makes no mention of NagornoKarabakh Armenia however rules out any vertical subordination of the NKR to the central Azerbaijani governmentAzerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov who with his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian also traveled to Minsk similarly described the meeting between the two presidents in a December 1 interview with dayaz He said the meeting took place in a productive and open atmosphere   Mammadyarov said that only one issue remains on which the two presidents have failed to reach agreement but he declined to specify what it is referring to the need to keep the peace process confidential He added that he plans to meet in Brussels on December 45 with Oskanian and the Minsk Group cochairsForeign Minister Oskanian for his part was more guarded in his comments on the Minsk meeting telling journalists on his return to Yerevan late on November 28 that I cannot say concretely whether progress was made or not but both presidents assessed the meeting as positive in terms of atmosphere and constructive approaches RFERLs Armenian Service reported on November 29 Echoing Aliyev Oskanian said the presidents mainly concentrated on the issues in the document on which no agreement has been reached presumably an allusion to a halfpage document drafted by the Minsk Group cochairs and enumerating general principles that the two presidents discussed earlier this yearOskanian also said that the elections due in Armenia next spring will not interrupt the ongoing peace negotiations but he admitted that they could make it more difficult to reach any agreementLacking Armenian ResponseKocharian declined to comment on the talks In Stepanakert however Armen Melikian an aide to Arkady Ghukasian president of the selfproclaimed NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR expressed concern over the implications of President Aliyevs pronouncements If President Aliyev is saying that the process is moving in a positive direction that is quite dangerous in itself Melikian told RFERLs Armenian Service on November 30 To my knowledge his idea of a positive direction is that NagornoKarabakh cannot be an independent and sovereign stateAs outlined by the Minsk Group cochairmen in June the draft peace plan under discussion envisages the gradual withdrawal of Armenian forces from territory they currently occupy contiguous to the NKR the demilitarization of that territory including the strategic Lachin corridor and Kelbacar and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force then at some future date the future status of the NKR visavis the Azerbaijani central government would be decided in a popular vote or referendum Insofar as the population of the NKR is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian such a vote would indubitably register support for independence Even so Melikian admitted to RFERL in February that the Karabakh leadership is not enthusiastic about that draft proposal He said that any discussion of a referendum is inappropriate in light of Bakus a priori insistence that Azerbaijans territorial integrity must be preserved at all costsThe Armenian leadership for its part has repeatedly made clear that it will not sign any final peace settlement that is unacceptable to the NKRThe

last year expanded by 14 percent according to the World Bank  faster than any other nonoil sector in the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS The countrys informationtechnology sector is also growing fast and attracting Western investors Politically Armenia  caught between Russia and the West  is trying to achieve a balancing act ComplementarityDeputy Foreign Minister Armen Baiburtian describes this as a policy of complementarityAs far as the interests of Russia are concerned and its relationship with and its attitude visavis Armenias policy of European integration is concerned let me say that Armenia is conducting a policy of complementarity Baiburtian says And if you would like me to mention the substance of this policy of complementarity this is that Armenia taking into consideration the interests of the major players in the region attaches special importance to its policy priority of softening the angles of contradiction between these powersArmenia would like to replace its Medzamor nuclear plant with a modern facility but the EU is not keen on bankrolling the ventureFor instance Baiburtian says Armenias good relations with Russia are complemented by strong links to the United StatesApart from both countries interests in the region both are home to large Armenian diasporas Each year Armenian expatriates send home 15 billion which equals the governments annual budgetThe diaspora is likely to keep growing In a recent survey 65 percent of interviewees said they see no future for their children in ArmeniaUnderstandable perhaps in a country that in recent years has backpedaled somewhat on democracy Armenias elections are seen as less and less free while the country has slipped to 102nd place in the Reporters Without Borders mediafreedom ranking Armenia is losing ground in corruption indices too  although on both counts it still beats Azerbaijan and Russia among othersArmenia is also struggling to keep up with its oilrich neighbor AzerbaijanThe two countries are still technically at war over the breakaway enclave of NagornoKarabakh And while Baku can afford to spend 1 billion on defense this year Armenia must make do with barely onequarter of thatDeputy Minister Baiburtian appears unfazed by the disparity Armenia will do what is necessary he says He also hints at other sources of aid  a possible reference to Russian backingEnergy ConcernsArmenias greatest security concern is energy Nearly all of its energy infrastructure  the Medzamor nuclear plant thermal power plants and the electricitydistribution networks  is now owned by Russia   Armenias Medzamor nuclear plant AFP file photoThis is where the policy of complementarity becomes visibly stretched Baiburtian says that Armenia is trying to diversify sources pointing to a gas pipeline from Iran that should become operational by the end of the yearHowever Western officials say this will mean little as long as the power plants using the gas remain in Russian hands One diplomat notes that Russias commercial dominance could prove more dangerous than its allpervasive military presence in ArmeniaThe Sovietmade Medzamor power plant perhaps illustrates well the shortcomings of the complementarity approach The European Union has said the plant is dangerous and has pressed Armenia for years to decommission it The European Commissions deputy head of mission in Tbilisi Robin Liddell who is responsible for relations with Yerevan says decommissioning Medzamor is a key element in the European Neighborhood Policy ENP action plans the EU has just signed with Armenia Both the United States and Russia are home to large Armenian diasporas aiding Armenias complementary relationship with the two powersMedzamor is one of the priorities in the new action plan with Armenia Liddel says This encompasses both a new energy strategy and decommissioning strategy This has been a longterm priority for the European Commission and the European Union The ENP action plan gives us the political commitment of the Armenian government to this activityArmenian officials counter that Medzamor is safe Theyve gradually pushed back the decommissioning date and the EU now believes it wont happen before 2016Armenia would like to replace Medzamor with a modern nuclear facility but the EU while keen to support the decommissioning of old reactors is not keen to bankroll the new ventureIn its energydiversification efforts Yerevan is building up a network of new thermal and hydroelectric power stationsAlternative SourcesThe gas pipeline from Iran is central to these efforts Sarmen Baghdassarian head of the policy planning department in the Armenian Foreign Ministry showcases the project as another success of the policy of complementarity  this time

When two years ago we were talking about the ArmeniaIran gas pipeline everybody was saying to us that its a dream But the pipeline is as our deputy minister mentioned after two months it will be operatingThere is however one regional power and neighbor whose relations with Armenia have yet to benefit from the policy Armenia still has no diplomatic relations with Turkey The border between the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1072847.html,East Womens Rights Project Employs Film As Advocacy Tool ,"November 20, 2006 14:00 GMT",,The OSIs sevenfilm project is called Gender Montage and was produced by local filmmakers in cooperation with womens rights advocates and researchers Some of the accounts are grippingly eloquent The best of them transcend inyourface moralizing to probe humanity under inhuman conditions Threes A Crowd In the Kyrgyz film Elechek Take Sairash is a woman who rejects her husbands polygamy Spurned for a younger wife by a man with whom she has spent the best years of her life and whom she still dearly loves Sairash refuses to accept the situation but finds it increasingly hard to fight Scornful relatives a judgmental community inequitable divorce laws  nothing seems to protect her  Breaking the shackles of tradition and prejudice Sairash eventually discovers herself and emerges as strong and independent  capable of standing up for her own beliefs  Nurgul Asylbekova from the OSIs Womens Program for Kyrgyzstan which produced Elechek tells RFERL that four in 10 Kyrgyz women who seek psychological counseling are affected by the stress of being sidelined as second or third wives Sairashs case is not isolated she says Usually the first wives turn to counseling but also the second and even the third Asylbekova says First wives are looking for advice on their property rights and psychological counseling Young wives are also looking for advice because they are vulnerable in the property issues they worry about childrens rights and so on Why has this problem been resurrected After Kyrgyzstan gained independence women were sidelined on a massive scale everywhere The industries in which women worked are in disarray  women who were employed in the light industries and had some rights are now practically on the street They have no social protection at all and no guaranteed social rights  Asylbekova claims that such factors have led to a revival of a more patriarchal attitude in Kyrgyzstan  regarding women as property as objects of desire and pleasure but also as a work force  With no women in parliament legislative help is probably far off Prevailing traditional wisdom dictates that it is better for a woman to become a second or third wife than to remain out of wedlock Asylbekova says polygamy has become fashionable and has even led to heated competition among Kyrgyz men for multiple wives Migrant Lives New Penelope is another documentary from Central Asia  this time Tajikistan Women whose husbands have left for Russia to work as migrant laborers evoke comparisons with the eponymous wife of the mythical Greek hero Odysseus who waited patiently for him to return from war  The mens absence places a heavy burden on these Tajik women who must provide for themselves and their children until the men can send money home  Sometimes the money never comes forcing wives to enter polygamous marriages simply to feed themselves and their children Marital bonds are tested and often break apart But the wives at home and their husbands abroad face similar fates grueling labor and abuse Zuhra Halimova the executive director of OSITajikistan tells RFERL that the effects of thousands of Tajik men leaving to find migrant work can be seen within all layers of society and in the film Its actually talking about the generations of women the mothers who are feeling sorry for their daughters the wives who are waiting for their husbands and feeling sorry for them because they know that the conditions in which their husbands are living are not pleasant  they had to leave and they also suffer Halimova says And at the same time the film provides an opportunity to actually look at human capacities in which the constraints in life due to the circumstances are making them act differently from the way they would usually be in their traditional context Halimova says that polygamy in Tajikistan is a result of class and economic diversification in the society Those who can afford it take second or even third wives Armenian Collision Armenia provides another of the OSI projects works called Womens Happiness Or Mens Dignity This film examines the conflict between tradition and modernity through the lives of two women One protagonist is a divorcee who as a struggling artist liberates herself and finds creative fulfillment the other is a widow who dreams of happiness within a maleheaded household  Despite their places at opposite ends of the social spectrum both women work hard and raise families as single mothers Armenuhi Tadevosyan the Womens Program coordinator of OSIArmenia tells RFERL that the drive for modernity  or as she calls it Europeization  of Armenia collides with tradition The charactershave two extremes and it is really the same in the society Tadevosyan says There is polarization and you can see two camps in the society  for example one that is following traditions and the other one that is protesting And sometimes it is very difficult to set up discussions between these two camps Although each of the seven films examines specific issues there is a distinctive thread that unites them all an increasing drift from what it is still described as postSoviet Even the lingua franca of the former empire  Russian  has given way to local tongues  But the each of these films settings appears to be pursuing its own path of development 15 years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union  and they have fewer and fewer common strings Central Asian CinemaGulnara

project But what will they bring to the people of Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia JavierSolana It will bring to the people of Azerbaijan a lot As you know this is a plan of cooperation with the government with your countries Armenia Azerbaijan and also Georgia It has an objective an objective to bring all the countries closer to the European Union with a mechanism the Neighborhood Policy which is the same technology that we used with the countries that were finally members of the European Union So we analyze different sectors of the governmental activity in economics in politics etc and then we construct an action plan It will therefore be something on politics and something on the economy all the sectors of the economy not only macroeconomic but also microeconomic And that is an important part of it It is agreed between the government of the respective country and the European Union Therefore it is done and you can do whatever you want to do So if you do it properly its not the European Union governing your country but its you governing yourselves while receiving help from the European Union So what does this bring to your people If the government is good if the government does things properly the European Union is going to continue helping your government Being closer to the European Union doesnt mean being part of the European Union RFERL And if the government is not good then what Solana Well if the government is not good as you can imagine the cooperation with that government will diminish If the government makes good use of the help that we give the Neighborhood Policy will keep on helping and increase the cooperation So this is a bilateral agreement and therefore a bilateral gain You do things better you get more You dont work sufficiently the government doesnt do as much as it can then the government will get less But the political technology thats used is the same that has been used in the new countries of the European Union Sector by sector chapter by chapter in a very wellorganized fashion We have a tremendous experience in doing it  RFERL There are a lot of conflicts in this region In Georgia in Azerbaijan Armenia and Azerbaijan are still in a state of war There is a ceasefire but they are still negotiating The action plans say some things about frozen conflicts How is the EU planning to help these countries to cooperate and how is the EU planning to resolve these conflicts Solana This approach that the European Union has established with you the countries of the South Caucasus has a bilateral component because at the end the plan is for every country and is not the same for every country But it has a common objective of helping to construct regional cooperation I dont think that in the world of today in the globalized world countries that are in a particular part of our planet in this case in a very specific place close to the European Union close to the Black Sea close to the Caspian Sea This is a very important region because it unites two parts of the planet and therefore has a very important role  But we would like those three countries to work among themselves as a region and that is the focus of the program we are establishing with you And therefore we want to work with you as a region As a consequence of that the conflicts that exist in the region have to be solved otherwise it will be very difficult to construct regional unity   Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov in Brussels to sign the accord official site So the first thing in order to have a region that works together that can progress together that can take advantage of all the addedvalue of working together has to be accompanied by a resolution of what you have called frozen conflicts Now I hope very much that the EU will be a catalyst for good RFERL European officials are talking about shared values Foreign ministers are talking about shared values but if you look at the situation on the ground for instance in Azerbaijan or in Armenia these countries are still struggling to hold free and fair elections Still you can see political prisoners media is attacked by the government Theres a hunger strike right now of 10 or 15 journalists protesting government pressure Do they really share your European values Some critics say that you are rewarding them not because of values but because for example in Azerbaijan you the EU needs some energy you need Azerbaijani oil and gas  Solana The example you use is wrong as we dont get any energy from Azerbaijan  RFERL But the EU signed an energy agreement with Azerbaijan last week Solana Well a memorandum of understanding But most of the EUs energy doesnt come from Azerbaijan For us Azerbaijan is not a source of energy as other countries are We would like Azerbaijan to develop as its an important country and we would like Armenia to develop as its an important country Now as far as values we share the values of democracy and the rule of law What we are signing with you the Neighborhood Policy the action plans these have elements that call very clearly for a direction That includes not only in doing good for the economy but also doing good for the democratic values that we defend and you defend  RFERL About the European Neighborhood Policy can you give some hope that some day these countries will join the European Union or will you just shut the door Solana You have to understand that the European Union does not have a vocation of representing half the world We have the vocation of being a group of countries with very good and solid relations with the rest of the world and also the countries that are closer from a geographical point of view and from a values point of view they will be closer to the European Union But being closer to the European Union doesnt mean being part of the European Union And of course we can sign with countries very profound cooperation agreements but membership is a different story that can not be infinite in number you have to understand that We never say No but we say lets keep on moving and lets keep on cooperating as much as possible Both your countries Armenia and Azerbaijan have profound relationships with other regions of the world You dont have to have an exclusive relationship vis a vis the European Union You have other important countries and regions of the world with which you have very solid relationships and you are not asking to be part of them But with the European Union you have probably the closest and most comfortable relationships RFERL Are you concerned about the deterioration of RussianGeorgian relations Solana We are trying to help find solutions to the tensions of the recent period I think the first thing that has to be done is to lower the temperature and in that direction were working very hard I hope both presidents will meet and they will talk frankly and they will try to lower the temperature The Georgians have to know that they live in a region in a place with problems in the neighborhood with South Ossetia with Abkhazia problems with defending their territorial integrity But to solve these problems the people that live in Abkhazia the people that live in South Ossetia must have to want to continue being in Georgia and for that the Georgians have to work also They are going to have the same neighbors forever and therefore when you know youre going to have neighbors forever you try to think ahead and try to organize your life knowing that and therefore trying to have good relations with the neighbors It is true that within that neighborhood there is a huge country like Russia and sometimes its more difficult to construct a relationship but that relationship has to be constructed So I think that most important at this point in time is to lower the temperature to calm down and begin recuperating and normalize the relationship RFERL If Kosovo gained independence some people have argued it could become a precedent for the frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union What do you think about that Solana My opinion is that no conflict is equal to the other and conflicts normally have an origin they have a development and they have a solution And its unlikely that the origin the development and the solution will be the same in the three conflictsEU Expands EastwardTo view

https://www.rferl.org/a/1072678.html,UN Agreement Brings Iron Silk Road Project Closer To Realization ,"November 13, 2006 12:30 GMT",,The first international deal pursuant to the development of the TransAsia Railway Network TAR is a milestone But significant obstacles remain to complete the TAR  including technical impediments and funding for nearly 6500 kilometers of railroadImproving Access To Landlocked CountriesThe November 10 deal is crucial for landlocked countries whose access to world markets is heavily dependent on efficient rail links to international ports Twelve of the worlds 30 landlocked countries are in Asia and 10 of those are TAR members  UNESCAPTAR is often compared to the ancient Silk Road the medieval trade route from China to Europe that connected the farthest corners of the known world for centuries The seeds of this Iron Silk Road were sown in 1960 when an initial plan envisioned a continuous 14000kilometer rail link between Singapore and Turkey via Southeast Asia India Pakistan and Iran But with rapid economic growth and increasing interdependence the TAR has grown exponentially Today it encompasses a complex network of nearly 81000 kilometers spread over four major geographical regions Kim Haksu is the executive director of the UN body overseeing the TAR UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific or UNESCAP He says the agreement signed by 18 transport ministers on November 10 from as far afield as Armenia Azerbaijan Iran Russia and the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan could usher in a new era of regional integrationRegional IntegrationWe are talking about a longrun regional integration through the TransAsian Railway and as you know we have also settled the Asian Highway one year ago Kim says So it is a good step forward and one day all these countries will realize and recognize the importance of the linking with each other  Rail cars waiting to offload oil at the port of Vladivostok Russia TASS file photoTen of TARs 28 members  including Georgia Kyrgyzstan Turkmenistan and Pakistan  did not sign the agreement but are expected to participate in the project nevertheless Afghanistan is among the countries lying on the route of the ancient Silk Road that is neither a TAR signatory nor expected to participate Kim says Kabuls absence has to do with internal political divisions but he hopes Afghanistan will join the TAR laterI think Afghanistan would join later Kim says But at the moment without Afghanistan the TransAsian railroad is still linked to the WestOne of the technical hurdles confronting TAR is the different rail widths or gauges Rail systems in the former Soviet Union for instance use a wider gauge than those in China The system in India on the other hand differs from them both Kim says the problem will be overcome with the help of containers which are already widely in use worldwideGetting Over The HurdlesWe can actually develop roadaccess ports in each of the different gauge areas and then this drive port will receive truckmounted containers that can be reshipped or transferred to the different gauges Kim explains So our experts say that different gauges are not a major problemUNESCAP experts believe that port efficiency can be enhanced through the integration of rail and shipping to avoid port congestion That is a key factor in Asia which is home to 13 of the worlds 20 largest container ports Kim says China South Korea and Russia are all major backers of TAR Once completed the project will significantly enhance their rail systems interoperabilityRussia is very excited and also their TSR TransSiberian Railway is wellestablished Kim says They have doubled lines and then they electrified all the TSR from Nakhodka Vladivostok to St Petersburg And it can be also linked easily to HelsinkiUNESCAP calls existing rail links within the South Caucasus Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia and Central Asia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan railways of international importance There are still sticking points for the TAR like funding and political strains of the type that kept North Korea from attending the November 10 signing But the first international deal to implement the project  signed nearly a halfcentury after TARs conception  might buoy the hopes of those who were beginning to get discouragedThe

theater  hungry to learn more about the rich musical heritages of Central Asia and Afghanistan  warmly received the performance of Afghan singer and harmonium player Assadullah Saifi on the night of October 19Film And MusicThe occasion was a festival called Music On Film  Film on Music The fiveday event features more than 100 films about music from around the world as well as live musical performances The program on October 19 focused on music from Central Asia and AfghanistanAfghan music is quite appealing to a Western audience Its there at the crossroads There are influences from Iran from Persia from Central Asia and from the Indian subcontinent And all of those things meet in AfghanistanFestival organizer Keith Jones attributes the enthusiasm of the audience to the exotic nature of the music and to outstanding musicianshipTheres also a political side underlying this  that people want to know more especially in Europe about the Islamic world he said They want to know more about secular cultures from Islamic countries because they are sort of attacked in the media with unfair stereotypes And a lot of people are searching for stories that lie underneath the headlines and underneath what is just on the surface And so Central Asian music has attracted relatively strong support within a certain community which is interested in world music and international cultures generallyThe festivals Asian focus included three films by Uzbek director Saodat IsmailovaShashmaqamThe film Revitalizing Shashmaqam Court Music of Central Asia offers a glimpse into shashmaqam  one of the primary styles of ancient court music that flourished in Silk Road cities of Central Asia like Samarkand Bukhara and TashkentHomayun Sakhi The Art Of The Afghan Rubab is a detailed portrait of the life and work of a master of Afghan traditional musicSakhi the subject of the film fled his native Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion But he developed a new musical style while living in exile in Pakistan Eventually he moved to Fremont California a small American town that has a large population of Afghan expatriates  border0Allamourad Rakhimov performing on his Turkmen instrument RFERLIsmailovas TengirToo Mountain Music Of Kyrgyzstan depicted the relationship between the Kyrgyz people their traditional music and the landscape One musician appearing in that film Bakyt Chytyrbaev attended the Prague screening After the film Chytyrbaev performed for the audience on a bowed instrument called a KylKyiakChytyrbaev told RFERL after his performance that European audiences appear eager to learn more about his style of music which is derived from ShamanismWhen I am here in Europe I feel that European audiences are ready to listen to and accept this music he said I know that Central Asian music is not well known here I believe this kind of music deserves to be known in the WestThe audience for the live music performances on October 19 included independent television director Simon Broughton He is the editor of Songlines a magazine dedicated to world music He also coedited the book The Rough Guide To World MusicGaining In PopularityBroughton told RFERL that Central Asian songs are not the most popular of the traditional music that is marketed in the West under the category of World Music But he says traditional music from Central Asia is making inroads into the global music marketThere are areas of the world where the musical interest is much stronger he said I mean Cuban music somehow captures peoples imagination The music of West Africa seems to be very dominant at the moment But within the Asian region I think Central Asia is attracting some attention There is certainly more toing and froing between Central Asia and the WestOne reason Central Asian music is exotic for European audiences is the fact that it was isolated for so long during the Soviet eraBroughton says one reason Central Asian music is exotic for European audiences is the fact that it was isolated for so long during the Soviet eraCertainly since the Central Asian countries achieved independence in 1991 theres been a real emphasis on the music he said And the music has become much better promoted or much more available in the West  both as a result of Western interest and Western companies going there and releasing things but also the countries themselves being able to promote their own musicFour films are being screened at the festival in Prague this week that were produced by Broughton He has traveled extensively in the Islamic world to produce awardwinning documentaries like Sufi Soul The Mystic Music Of Islam and Breaking The Silence Music In AfghanistanAt The CrossroadsTheres been a lot of interest in Afghan music partly because of the Taliban and the severity of the Taliban ban on music he said The Taliban basically forbade any sort of music except musically unaccompanied chants and songs in praise of the Taliban As a result of that theres been a curiosity to the music of Afghanistan And actually Afghan music is quite appealing to a Western audience Its there at the crossroads There are influences from Iran from Persia from Central Asia and from the Indian subcontinent And all of those things meet in AfghanistanAudience members less familiar with Central Asian music also found similarities to Western music Among them was Heath Hanlin a classically trained musician from New York  Musicians conducting a jam session during the festival RFERLI was really interested in the rhythms and the precision of the playing  particularly on the stringed instruments he said Northern European progressive rock from the 1970s was reminiscent of that I think it would be fair to sayAnother festivalgoer who closely studied the performance techniques of the Central Asian artists was Joel Tait a native of Somerset England who is studying percussionYeah its exotic he said I study drumming here actually in Prague So I was really interested to come along and see what the musicians from that region had to offer We got a great look because there were the films from the region and then a whole load of musicians from different countries in Central Asia and then a jam session between Western musicians and Eastern It was great fun It was a great vibe just to see everyone together Ive not been lucky enough to see enough stuff like thisIn Tune With Central Asia Music On Film Film On MusicCENTRAL EUROPE MEETS CENTRAL ASIA A Praguebased festival featuring nearly 100 films about music from around the world placed

has ranged from sympathy for Georgia to support for Russias actions to fear of what the crackdown may ultimately mean for others ,PRAGUE October 6 2006 RFERL  Throughout the CIS public response to the crisis has ranged from sympathy for Georgia to support for Russias actions to fear of what the crackdown may ultimately mean for others  In Belarus where the government maintains a policy of unwavering loyalty to the Kremlin residents were quick to defend Moscow  and criticize Georgia as an upstart nation that is only getting what it deserves Every single citizen of the former Soviet Union living as a migrant in Russia should take the situation in Georgia really close to heart  The Russians did the right thing said one Belarusian man The Georgians are now behaving in a very defiant way with regard to Russia In a way theyve provoked them into stirring up scandal But I dont think there will be a big scandal I think that Russia could be even tougher on Georgia  But elsewhere people expressed dismay at the intensity of the crisis and defended Georgias steps to break free of Russian influence  I think its wrong to suspend all the links between Russia and Georgia said a woman in Kazan the capital of the autonomous republic of Tatarstan We live in 21st century I think they need to talk to solve the situation  My attitude toward Georgian government policy is very good said a second Kazan resident Georgia should live its own life they should find there own path without us Every country should be independent  Concern In Russias Near Abroad But the conflict between Moscow and Tbilisi is more than just a spectator sport for the former Soviet republics that to varying degrees have pursued their own independent identities in the 15 years since the breakup of the USSR  For some the Russian blockade on transport and communication links to Georgia has had an immediate knockon economic effect  For others the clampdown on the rebellious CIS nation may act as a signal to temper their own proWestern ambitions  Perhaps most critically for many it means the fear that Moscows measures against Georgia may eventually be extended to other neighbors as well  That concern raised to outright alarm with Putins call for a crackdown on illegal migrants and markets dominated by foreign workers and groups with socalled mafia ties  Russias Federal Migration Service responded promptly proposing tough penalties for businesses that employ illegal migrants limiting border crossings and reducing visa periods  Among the proposals is a measure to impose a quota system that would limit migrants to visits of between 90 to 180 days depending on their country of origin  Today Georgians Tomorrow Tajiks The measures are sure to strike fear in the hearts of many economic migrants from the former Soviet republics who have flowed by the tens of thousands into Russia to find work to support their families back home  A Tajik migrant worker in Moscow said he was watching the Georgia situation with growing concern  Every single citizen of the former Soviet Union living as a migrant in Russia should take the situation in Georgia really close to heart he said If its the Georgians today it will be Uzbeks and Tajiks tomorrow We should not be happy about what is happening to Georgians  Russias unrelenting assault on Georgia has also raised speculation that Moscow is using the dispute to bring other Westwardlooking exrepublics back into its sphere of influence   In this it may get assistance from Belarus Moscow is looking to clamp down on the number of Georgians entering its territory visafree via Belarus To that end it says it will press Minsk to create a visa regime with Georgia  Belarus initially indicated that economic and communication ties with Georgia would continue unchanged  But on October 5 Vadzim Papou chairman of the Belarusian House of Representatives commission that oversees contacts with CIS states gave clear signs of a reversal saying consultations are under way on Georgian transit through Russia  Russia Resurgent As West Watches Many see the Georgia conflict as part of the Kremlins broader power struggle with the United States which has also sought footholds in the region  Both Washington and Brussels have responded relatively meekly to the Georgia crisis sparking fears that Moscows impact in the postSoviet arena the may again be on the rise The conflict has raised concerns that Moscow is using the dispute to bring other Westwardlooking exrepublics back into its sphere of influence Among the countries watching the developments with concern are Moldova and Ukraine  which together with Georgia and Azerbaijan have sought to consolidate a Westernleaning bloc with the GUAM regional grouping  GUAMs proWestern aspirations have already been struck a blow by the political ascent of proMoscow Viktor Yanukovych to Ukraines prime ministerial post But the sanctions against Georgia could do even more damage  Hennadiy Udovenko a member of the proWestern Our Ukraine faction and former foreign minister has blasted the Russian stance on Georgia saying it is using the blockade as a warning to other likeminded countries  Russia would like to renew its influence in the postSoviet space and to that end is conducting an imperialist policy in order to undermine the sovereignty of the postSoviet states  Udovenko said In particular this is currently demonstrated by Russias attitude toward Georgia  Economic Realities Moldova since March 2006 has suffered the effects of a ban on wine and agricultural exports to Russia The embargo has meant a dramatic decrease in the impoverished countrys muchneeded export income  Chisinau says those sanctions  similar to the wine ban imposed on Georgia at the same time  reflect the Kremlins displeasure with Moldovas Western aims  The recent referendum in Moldovas separatist Transdniester region in which voters overwhelmingly opted for eventual union with Russia has only raised tensions between Chisinau and Moscow  Vlad Cubreacov who heads the opposition Christian Democrat faction in the Moldovan parliament says ideally the current troubles in Georgia should prompt an expression of support from the West  The Republic of Moldova is already suffering important losses due to the Russian embargo he said But the Georgian case must give us hope and show us the right way  the way of principles correctness and the way of imposing with help from the West respect for the integrity and sovereignty of our country  A Vulnerable Neighbor In Armenia the effect of the Georgian transport ban has been immediate Armenia is highly dependent on Georgian transit for its Russian imports and exports  Now with railway road and air traffic blocked Armenian businessmen say they are scrambling for ways to get their goods to Russia Russia would like to renew its influence in the postSoviet space and to that end is conducting an imperialist policy in order to undermine the sovereignty of the postSoviet states The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti and the Ukrainian port of Ilyichevsk will reportedly continue to handle Armenian cargo bound for the Russian market  But lawmaker and Kilikia brewery owner Ashot Baghdasaryan says his business and others are already incurring significant losses as a result of the blockade  There is information that our shipment has been stopped on the RussianGeorgian border Its a very big problem for businessmen Baghdasaryan said  I think both Georgia and Russian should have stopped and remembered that they have international agreements There is no declaration of war between them and I hope it wont reach that stage I wish they could respect the international agreements they have signed and not put Armenia in this situation  Gestures Of Support Oilrich Azerbaijan has been careful to maintain warm ties with Moscow even as it seeks influential friends further afield But some officials suggest Baku may be willing to fill the vacuum left by Moscow  Georgia may try to introduce some products to markets in Azerbaijan which it wanted to sell in Russia said opposition lawmaker Ali Masimov Georgia may also try to buy some products from Azerbaijan which it wanted to buy from Russia  Oqtay Haqverdiyev who heads the Cabinet of Ministers department on economic policy said the sanctions will have no immediate impact on Azerbaijan However he allowed for the remote possibility that an extended crisis could affect the operation of the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline which transits Georgia  In the short term those most likely to suffer financially from the blockade are the 500000 Azerbaijanis who live in Georgia many of whom send money home to help support their families in AzerbaijanRussia And GeorgiaBeefed up security outside Russian military headquarters in Tbilisi on September 27 InterPressNewsNOT ALL WINE AND ROSES Moscows relations with Tbilisi since

Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan and Moldova on September 25 held ministeriallevel talks where they discussed the conflicts in NagornoKarabakh Abkhazia South Ossetia and Transdniester ,On the sidelines of the 61st UN General Assembly currently under way in New York Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan and Moldova on September 25 held ministeriallevel talks where they discussed the conflicts in NagornoKarabakh Abkhazia South Ossetia and Transdniester In the last 15 years frozen conflicts in the GUAM region namely in Moldova Georgia and Azerbaijan have affected the lives of over 16 million people Not only that but theyve remained a threat to international peace and security according to a joint statement by the GUAM foreign ministers to the General Assembly Greater Awareness NeededThe push for greater recognition seems to have worked A discussion on frozen conflicts in the General Assembly is now scheduled for November 6 Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said that GUAM will continue preparatory activities until that time  The GUAM heads of state in their joint declaration on the issue of conflict settlement called upon UN states and international organizations to further facilitate within their competence the process of settlement of conflicts in the GUAM area he said Therefore the inclusion of the new item on the conflicts in the GUAM area in the agenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to raise the awareness of the assembly about dangerous developments emerging from those unresolved conflictsUkrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk told the General Assembly that the protracted conflicts continue to destabilize peace and security in the region and prevent economic development Whats needed he said is global awarenessIt is an important step that will help to draw the attention to the need of more active and effective steps of the international community in order to achieve progress and settlement in conflicts on the territory of Azerbaijan Georgia and Moldova Tarasyuk said These conflicts are among the main obstacles for the fullscale democratic transformations in the region which is among the core elements of the regional policy of UkraineInternational Help NeededGeorgia in particular is placing high hopes on the General Assembly debate It is dealing with two frozen conflicts  in Abkhazia and South Ossetia In November South Ossetians will vote in a referendum on independence  Speaking at the General Assembly on September 22 Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said international organizations needed to lend a hand to find a solutionThe essential elements of this package must include the demilitarization of Abkhazia and South Ossetia backed by the active engagement of the UN OSCE Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe the European Union and other international organizations Saakashvili said This must include direct dialogue between parties on the ground and here I mean the central Georgian government and the separatist authorities  so that together we can assume responsibility for rebuilding the peaceRussian ObjectionsRussia however is not impressed It dismissed the GUAM member states attempts to engage a wider UN audience in matters that Moscow considers foreignpolicy priorities In particular Russia supports independence drives in Transdniester and South Ossetia  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the GUAM initiative a propagandistic step and said that hearings at the General Assembly will not produce anything positiveAnd last week in an interview with a Greek newspaper Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that Moscow will not allow GUAM peacekeepers into frozenconflict zones regardless of what is discussed at the General AssemblyAs Russia is a

https://www.rferl.org/a/1071505.html,CIS Referendums Seen As Kremlins Master Plan ,"September 20, 2006 15:29 GMT",Few observers think that the Transdniester referendum is only about Transdniestrian independence Amanda Akcakoca an analyst with the European Policy Center a Brusselsbased think tank says its also a gesture to Russia ,Few observers think that the Transdniester referendum is only about Transdniestrian independence Amanda Akcakoca an analyst with the European Policy Center a Brusselsbased think tank says its also a gesture to Russia  I think the point is to show their short of undying support for Russia To show to the world that theyre unhappy with the situation they are in and that they continue to support and want to be part of Russia says Akcakoca  She adds that this in turn gives Russia in return a very strong case for keeping its troops armaments in Transdniester  You Scratch Moscows Back  Its a symbiotic relationship that Moscow appears happy to exploit While Western governments turned their back on the Transdniester vote Moscow announced it planned to recognize the referendum  The results of the vote have no legal weight But they are a useful tool in keeping the Transdniestrian conflict frozen  something that in turn stalls Moldovas stated aim of closer ties with the European Union and NATO  Michael Emerson of the Center for European Policy Studies another Brussels think tank says the Transdniester referendum comes amid heightened EU presence in the region  For the past year an EU Border Assistance Mission has monitored Transdniesters boundaries to cut down on suspected smuggling  Nuisance Value Emerson says there is no evidence to suggest either that Russia was involved in organizing the referendum or that it came in response to the heightened EU presence But he says the referendum clearly aids a broader Kremlin scheme Russia one expert suggests does not think it needs stable and peaceful neighbors on its borders And the EU is failing to persuade it otherwise The Russian strategy is to try to consolidate its power and influence in the European neighborhood countries or in the former Soviet states in general excepting the Baltic cases which they have given up Emerson says But to sustain this Moldova affair unresolved is quite useful nuisance value in terms of Russian diplomacy  The other frozen conflicts  Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and the AzerbaijaniArmenian standoff over NagornoKarabakh  have similar nuisance value in terms of holding back those countries Western ambitions  Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia  like Moldova and Ukraine  have all been offered Action Plans as part of the EUs Neighborhood Policy which offers closer ties to Brussels but does not necessarily connote a promise of eventual membership  Georgia too has made plain its aim to join NATO Foreign ministers for the military alliance are expected to announce in New York on September 21 that they are prepared to step up talks with Tbilisi although an invitation to join NATO may still be far in the future  Frozen Barriers To The West But as long as their separatist conflicts remain frozen all these countries are limited in terms of far how their talks can advance with the EU and NATO which will not accept new members still afflicted by unsettled internal conflicts    Keeping Georgia away from the West ITARTASSIn this way the Kremlin  by tacitly or openly supporting the separatist bids of regions like Transdniester and South Ossetia  can keep an effective leash on the former Soviet republics  The EU is aware of this policy and its actions are in part a counterbalance to those of Moscow It is clearly interested for example in reintegrating Transdniester into Moldova in order to bring Chisinau into the EU fold  But Emerson notes that the EU does not exactly mirror the Kremlins geopolitical style While it supports the Westward leanings of Moldova Ukraine and the South Caucasus countries it is eager to ensure that they  and the EU  work to maintain a good relationship with Russia  No Match For Moscow  Its a more subtle position than that of Russias Emerson says And that in his opinion means it doesnt go far enough  The European Union is not doing enough in those countries It is offering them Neighborhood Policy Lite Emerson says In particular it is doing everything to prevent either Moldova or Ukraine from having any perspective of membership of the European Union  Both Emerson and Akcakoca note that the EU is suffering from enlargement fatigue after its last expansion to 25 countries in 2004 Both also point out that the unions neighborhood policy offer has great potential for its targets if they chose to pursue it with vigor  However in the end this may not be enough The EUs subtler strategy appears to be no match to Russias more robust approach  More To Come  The Transdniestrian referendum will set a precedent for other breakaway regions in the former Soviet Union  first and foremost South Ossetia which holds its own independence referendum on November 12  Russia she says clearly does not think it needs stable and peaceful neighbors on its borders And the EU is failing to persuade it otherwiseRussia does things the way Russia does things and no voices in the EU are going to change that policy I would imagine she says A substantial number of EU member states have long made it clear that they value good relations with Moscow above most other EU foreign policy objectivesRussia And The WestepaCOOPERATION CONFLICT CONFRONTATION Relations between Russia and the West are notoriously volatile To see the kind of relationship that presidents Bush and Putin have developed and to see Russia firmly anchored in the West thats really a dream of 300 years not just of the

offenders on the NGOs socalled Worst of the Worst list as does the Russian republic of Chechnya Freedom House says it hopes the list will be used by national governments and the United Nations to address the worlds most pressing human rights abuses ,The Central Asian nations of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan rank among the top offenders on the NGOs socalled Worst of the Worst list as does the Russian republic of Chechnya Freedom House says it hopes the list will be used by national governments and the United Nations to address the worlds most pressing human rights abuses Freedom House says its Worst of the Worst list is especially critical in a year when the United Nations newly formed Human Rights Council begins work The list which covers the period from December 1 2004 to November 30 2005 pinpoints eight countries as having the worst human rights records over the past year They are Burma Cuba Libya North Korea Sudan Syria Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan It also calls attention to two territories Chechnya and Tibet where civilians are subject to what Freedom House calls intense repression The report rates 192 countries in terms of political and civil freedoms assigning labels of free partly free and not free This year 46 percent of the countries were ranked as free an additional 30 percent were partly freeOverall says Kristie Evenson the director of Freedom House Europe the trend during the past decade has been an expansion rather than reduction of freedoms Central Asian TrendThere are of course exceptions Evenson says the general tendency in Central Asia appears to be a regression away from democratic development The most pronounced examples are two of the lowestranked countries in the Freedom House report Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan Both received the poorest possible rating in terms of civil liberties and political rights and were deemed not free Uzbekistan the site of the May 2005 Andijon massacre was noted as undergoing a decline in civil liberties Speaking to RFERL from Freedom Houses European headquarters in Budapest Evenson said the trend is evident throughout Central Asia  with one possible exception Kyrgyzstan which received a rating of partly free Kyrgyzstan has shown some potential promise on the political front she says But the general trend in Central Asia is actually a constriction of freedom What were seeing in Central Asia is a continuing tightening of a lot of these regimes in terms of having little hope for political freedom or civil liberties that will have an improvement in the near future particularly in places like Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan Little Hope In Chechnya Chechnya was also singled out for particular criticism Russia overall received a rating of not free Its breakaway republic the site of a civil war that has raged since 1999 saw a continuation of the conflict in 2005 with no letup in accompanying reports of torture disappearances and war crimesThe Freedom House report notes that the year also marked the March assassination of Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov That the report says further reduced already faint hopes that a peaceful resolution to the crisis could be achieved Evenson says the situation in Chechnya appears to offer little hopeOn Chechnya following a trend unfortunately for almost a whole decade its got the lowest category qualifying it for the worst of the worst We dont witness any real improvement in political and civil liberties The security situation has continued to make any real participation by citizens more fiction than fact and this situation doesnt look to be improving in the near future she addsAzerbaijan A ConcernThe South Caucasus nations of Georgia and Armenia fared slightly better both maintaining ratings of partly free Azerbaijan however was penalized receiving a rating of not free Evenson says the rating is due in part to the countrys November 2005 parliamentary elections which came under widespread criticism as flawed by ballot stuffing and other procedural violations The score of Azerbaijan is a consistent score from years past where we dont see a lot of political reform efforts that happened during the time of the report Evenson says What we do see is a questionable election process judicial processes that dont appear to be fair and freedomofassembly issues clearly have been of concern in AzerbaijanBelarus Ukraine Going In Opposite DirectionsAmong the worstranked nations was Belarus which has received a rating of not free every year since the Freedom House survey was launched in 1996 The NGO says the regime of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka grew increasingly dictatorial during 2005 with authorities clamping down on free media and public expression in its bid to ensure Lukashenkas reelection in 2006 One bright spot on the list was Ukraine the only country in the former Soviet Union besides the Baltic states to receive a rating of free The report spans the period that saw the conclusion of the Orange Revolution the nonviolent public movement that brought proWestern politician Viktor Yushchenko to power Evenson says that and the largely peaceful transfer of power that followed contributed in large part to Kyivs positive ratingUkraine is having the promise of quite a lot of political and civil reforms she says When you see that when this study was conducted we did have an orderly changeover of government with a respect to the legislation that was in place political and electoral processes as well as the beginning of a reform of a larger legislative system it provides hope that the mechanisms and structures in Ukraine  although still very weak  can produce the beginnings of a base of a more viable and longlasting democracyElections In Iran Iraq AfghanistanIran and Iraq both received ratings of not free Iraq saw some improvement was credited with an improvement in its political rights over a period that saw the countrys first national elections since the toppling of Saddam Hussein  the January 2005 vote for the preparliamentary National Assembly June 2005 saw presidential elections in Iran bring hardliner Mahmud Ahmadinejad to power prompting the United States to criticize the ballot as flawed Evenson says the Islamic Republic remains hampered by a weak political mechanismThe core of their problems is a political system which is either young very weak in formation or quite highly suppressive in the case of Iran she says In terms of how that affects the citizens in these countries what were seeing is that their basic rights to be part of the democratic process to be able to express basic civil and political rights is still quite constricted or is being more constrictedAfghanistan which received a rating of partly free in the new Freedom House report in 2005 completed the Bonn process initiated after the fall of the Taliban regime to create a system of democratic governance Its September parliamentary and provincialcouncil elections were marked by

https://www.rferl.org/a/1070808.html,CIS Armenia Latest To Agonize Over Anthem ,"August 24, 2006 14:47 GMT",,PRAGUE August 24 2006 RFERL  The mood is a little fractious in the Armenian capital this summer and the weather isnt helping The mercury has climbed inexorably above 40 degrees Celsius  But not even the boiling sun can match the heat generated by the debate over whether Armenia should ditch its national anthem and adopt something more modern more attuned to todays national aspirations  The very idea according to the nationalist Dashnaktsutiun Party  which forms part of the coalition government  is tantamount to sacrilege The Dashnaks like things just as they are    Listen to a portion of Armenias national anthem 31 secondsReal Audio Windows Media Mer Hayrenik or Our Fatherland was penned by Mikael Ghazavi Nalbandian one of the most revered nationalist figures of the 19th century and adopted as the national anthem by the shortlived Armenian state of 191820  Thereafter it was banned by the Bolsheviks and became a hymn of protest before being reinstated as the national anthem when Armenia declared its independence in 1991  So why change it now  Take a look on Armenian blogsite blogrelcom and you get an idea why The song is too wimpy complains one visitor  and too gloomy  Take verse three None of the usual chestthumping banality of national anthems here But perhaps not calculated either to fill the hearts of young schoolchildren with patriotic joy  Death is the same everywhere People die only once Lucky are the ones that are Sacrificed for the freedom of the nationArmenia is of course not the first postSoviet state to go through the agonies of this debate  Russia fretted over it through the 1990s briefly replacing the Soviet anthem with a temporary lyricfree piece by 19thcentury composer Mikhail Glinka   Listen to a portion of Russias national anthem 35 secondsReal Audio Windows MediaA 22person commission made up of Armenias wisest and best has been sifting through 85 candidates to come up with a new anthem In 2000 it once again reverted to the Sovietera melody  albeit with new words to replace paeans to Lenins ideas and the unbreakable union of the Soviet state  Sacred Russia the new version proclaims protected by God  But divine care was not enough to persuade liberals like Grigory Yavlinsky leader of the opposition Yabloko party who warned that the reversion to the Soviet tune was a harbinger of terrible things Georgias Trials In Georgia too the debate was fierce But no nostalgia there Two years ago it ditched the existing postSoviet anthem in favor of a new song    Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili right sings the national anthem with reservists and children at a military training camp near Tblisi earlier this month epaLegislators said the fresh tune had more appropriate lyrics and  so they hoped  a catchy new melody  But many Georgians were unimpressed  like this man on the street speaking to RFERLs Georgian Service  They used to criticize our football and rugby international players because they didnt sing the last national anthem the man said But you tell me how theyre going to sing this one Very interesting Nobody will be able to sing it Then everyone will ask again why theyre not singing Because they wont be able to sing it  Or this man who clearly thought the old Soviet Georgian anthem couldnt be bettered  It needs the sort of words that will give you goose pimples he said I remember how the anthem used to be Eternal glory to the nation  what do you think of that eh Pretty damn good Anthem Tidbits For every republic of the former Soviet Union there is a similar saga PostSoviet Moldova briefly adopted the Romanian anthem but abandoned it in favor of a new song to reflect the individual Moldovan identity That anthem is called Our Language  which in Moldova is virtually identical to Romanian  In Kyrgyzstan a debate continues to simmer over its postSoviet anthem The source of contention is a single word beikut which  according to which Kyrgyz dialect youre speaking can mean either peace or bad luck  Russias Republic of Tatarstan meanwhile had no individual anthem during the Soviet era But it adopted an anthem after the revival of its statehood That song is now played at all official events together with the Russian anthem  But to return to Armenia where a 22person commission made up of the countrys wisest and best has been sifting through 85 candidates to come up with a new anthem  Its a heavy burden as one of the judges Culture Minister Hasmik Poghosian makes clear in remarks to RFERLs Armenian ServiceWhen we really are no longer wretched and forsaken Ill enter the anthem competition myself  Felix BakhchinianIts been very difficult When you have to listen to one song after another And clearly you cant feel the same way about all of them Poghosian said And it would have been wrong to make a quick decision and immediately announce the winner  Its hard work made harder still by some unrelenting criticism of the whole projectFelix Bakhchinian director of the Charents Literature and Art Museum in Yerevan is one of many who think this is not the time for choosing a new anthem  I too want to get rid of references to the motherland as wretched and forsaken like we have in the existing anthem Bakhchinian said But we need to solve more pressing problems before we begin talking about the anthem and other state attributes Right now we have higher priorities to meet And when we really are no longer wretched and forsaken Ill enter the anthem competition myself  Harsh words from a man highly respected in the world of Armenian art But not harsh enough to stop the commission Its narrowed the field down to five finalists  and word is that one song is head and shoulders above the rest  Its lyrics based on a poem by early 20thcentury poet Yeghishe Charents drops much of the grim imagery in favor of praise for the sunbaked taste of Armenian words    Listen to a portion of the proposed new Armenian anthem 23 secondsReal Audio Windows Media Whatever their views on the tune and its lyrics Armenias legislators would be wise to pay

Georgia this week The euphoria that swept the young team of Georgian ministers when the Orange Revolution triumphed in Ukraine in January 2005 has all but dissipated,PRAGUE August 7 2006 RFERL  There will be little talk of colored revolutions in Georgia this week The euphoria that swept the young team of Georgian ministers when the Orange Revolution triumphed in Ukraine in January 2005 has all but dissipatedFor a few heady months Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili saw himself  and Georgias own Rose Revolution  as the catalyst for change throughout the CIS Ukraine was followed by Kyrgyzstan and perhaps Saakashvili could imagine a region ruled by presidents fashioned in his own imageNow its time for a reality checkInstead of Yuliya Tymoshenko Ukraine has Viktor YanukovychRegional AlliancesBut how serious a blow is this to the proponents of democratic change Salome Zurabishvili was foreign minister of Georgia at the time of the Orange Revolution and responsible for forging a strong strategic alliance with the new democratic UkraineThis is bad for Georgia from the point of view that Russia will conclude that these revolutions are not irreversible and that with a little help it is possible to reverse the process Zurabishvili said So all of Georgias efforts at this time should be directed at assuring the Georgian people Russia and international society that this process in Georgia is irreversibleBut while Ukraine may no longer be so steadfast an ally of Georgia in the face of Russian pressure some see here a triumph for Ukrainian democracy  and by association the values that both the Orange and Rose revolutions are built on Cory Welt the deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for International and Strategic Studies in Washington said that what we have seen in Ukraine is the most democratic outcome that we could have envisioned So in that regard it doesnt change anything What it does change is the fact that they had linked the democracy agenda to this proWestern agenda And I think nobody had anticipated that in Ukraine those wouldnt necessarily go together he saidErkin Alymbekov takes a similar view The deputy speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament told RFERLs Radio Azattyk that last weeks events in Ukraine had been a triumph of common sense  President Viktor Yushchenko right shakes hands with Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv on August 3 About half the population of Ukraine is supporting Yanukovych and his political stance is very popular there Yushchenko  who did not play a game around the colored revolutions and who put his personal patriotic and presidential duties higher than ordinary ambition in order to deal with the political crisis who put forward Yanukovych as the prime minister of the coalition government  this I suppose is the fair and right stance Alymbekov saidIndeed as far as Kyrgyzstan is concerned said Martha Brill Olcott  a senior associate with the Russian and Eurasian Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington DC  the reality is that little will changeI dont think it will affect Kyrgyzstan honestly except that it will make its foreign policy easier  just because their foreign policy is closely oriented to Russia Olcott saidProblems In Central AsiaIndeed there are few in Kyrgyzstan likely to mourn the fading of the Orange Revolution Any hopes harbored by democratic reformers that the socalled Tulip Revolution would become a model for democratic change in Central Asia have so far proved prematureIn fact if Olcott is correct it is one of the more authoritarian regimes of the region that may have more cause for concernIronically Kazakhstan may have more problems I mean Kazakhstan is one of those places that did build very explicit bridges to the new regime and Ukraine and with the new government of Ukraine Olcott said KazakhUkrainian economic cooperation was pretty good before and I think they saw this as strengthening the free market in Ukraine and in Kazakhstans interestsYet here too business as usual seems the more likely outcome Kazakhstan and Ukraine have a mutual interest in seeing business relations developKonstantin Gabashvili the chairman of the Georgian parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee takes heart too from the fact that Yushchenko still controls Ukrainian foreign policy and Yanukovychs commitment to continue democratic reformsAs for Ukraines main political course the main thing for us is that according to the document they signed it shouldnt really change Yushchenko guaranteed that the course would remain unchanged and if anything happens Yushchenko will react on that Gabashvili said I cant say that the situation is easy in Ukraine but its not tragic and it is not worth giving any reaction but support the main course of UkraineNo tragedy but for the moment at least the end of the colored revolutions Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka said in 2005 there will be no rose orange or banana revolutions in

Armenias largest governing party the Republican Party of Armenia HHK,Sarkisian said that Kocharian does not object to his farreaching alliance with Armenias largest governing party the Republican Party of Armenia HHKRift Between Sarkisian KocharianMany Armenia observers believe that Sarkisians decision to align himself with Prime Minister Andranik Markarians HHK does not sit well with Kocharian who is widely expected to resign after completing his second term in office in early 2008 Reports have pegged Sarkisian as a possible candidate to succeed Kocharian But Sarkisians ties to the HHK could conflict with the presidents perceived efforts to contain the HHK and secure his own political future Asked whether he thinks he could be sacked by Kocharian for joining the HHK Sarkisian replied How can I rule out the possibility of the president dismissing me when he is the supreme commander in chief of the armed forces and can do that with a single signature But I rule out his doing so in connection with my affiliation with the HHK because the president of the republic has fully approved my intention I think there will be an occasion for him or his spokesman to speak about this Besides what is the use of taking steps contradicting the opinion of the supreme commander in chief Observers say Kocharian does not necessarily back Sarkisians reputed presidential ambitions despite having closely cooperated with the powerful defense minister for nearly two decades Sarkisian himself says he has not yet decided whether to run for president in 2008Its very difficult to say if I will run because Ive never given it serious thought he said You may not believe me but I am speaking sincerely I will make my decision after the parliamentary elections are held in May 2007 All I can say is that Ive never strove for any position All of my friends know this Working With HHKSpeaking to RFERL late on July 19 Prime Minister Markarian was likewise vague about Sarkisians presidential ambitions and stopped short of ruling out his own participation in the 2008 presidential ballot We will see in 2008 he said   Andranik Markarian epa file photoMarkarian also described as logical Sarkisians decision to join his party He felt that he likes the partys ideology and program Markarian said Besides we have closely cooperated during all these years and are simply formalizing this fact Sarkisian has repeatedly made it clear that a possible presidential bid hinges on the HHKs performance in next years parliamentary elections This has been construed by opposition leaders and other government critics as a sign that the Republicans will seek to hold on to their parliamentary plurality in the next National Assembly at any cost The HHK boasts the largest faction in the current National Assembly controlling at least 41 of its 131 seats Sarkisian said on July 20 that he would consider maintaining that number in the next Armenian parliament an excellent result I havent yet discussed this topic with members and leaders of the Republican Party he said when asked how many parliament seats it is looking to win But I have decided for myself that if the Republicans win up to 2122 percent of the vote in the elections I will consider that satisfactory if they get up to 25 percent I will consider that good if they get more than that I will consider that excellent Karabakh CompromiseSarkisian the former wartime commander of Karabakh Armenian forces also endorsed a compromise solution to the NagornoKarabakh conflict favored by international mediators He said he agreed with the Armenian governments overall acceptance of a recent plan that calls for a referendum on Karabakhs status after the liberation of Azerbaijani territories surrounding the disputed region Yes I am in favor of the proposed principles How can I be against something that I have said for years But at the same time he left room for maneuver in the event of popular opposition to the peace plan If the public has a different opinion another political force will win a majority and pursue its policy and that would be very good he said How can I oppose something which is to our peoples

acceptable its Armenian counterpart has highlighted several points that were either not clarified or not discussed ,While the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has confirmed that those principles are largely acceptable its Armenian counterpart has highlighted several points that were either not clarified or not discussed the interview US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza gave on June 22 to RFERLs Armenian and Azerbaijani services Meanwhile the Karabakh Armenian leadership has rejected one point on which Armenia and Azerbaijan have reportedly reached agreement namely holding a referendum on the future political status of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR The Karabakh Armenians have further signaled their reluctance to cede all the Azerbaijani districts they currently occupy before a firm agreement is reached on the future status of the NKR Confidentiality Broken Over the 14 years that the Minsk Group has been trying to mediate a political solution to the Karabakh conflict those involved have generally abided by a gentlemens agreement that the negotiating process should remain confidential  The rationale for doing so is primarily to avoid derailing the peace process by alerting the public in one or other country to unpalatable concessions required that opposition parties might seize upon to discredit national leaders prepared to accept those concessions  But the cochairs who have on several previous occasions deplored the failure of the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents to prepare public opinion for inevitable concessions seem to have concluded that going public may encourage the two presidents to demonstrate what they term the necessary political courage and agree at least to the basic principles of a settlement before the perceived window of opportunity for doing so closes with the approach of parliamentary elections in Armenia in May 2007 The basic principles as outlined in a statement by the cochairs on June 22 to the OSCEs Permanent Council in Vienna and posted on June 28 on the website of the US Embassy in Yerevan point to a phasedpackage approach to resolving the conflict meaning that the various elements of a settlement are agreed on simultaneously even though they are implemented successively with one key aspect  the final status of the NKR  to be decided by a referendum or vote at some unspecified future date These principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around NagornoKarabakh with special modalities for Kelbacar and Lachin districts separating Karabakh from Armenia proper said the cochairs Demilitarization of those territories would follow A referendum or population vote would be agreed at an unspecified future date to determine the final legal status of NagornoKarabakh An international peacekeeping force would be deployed added the statement A joint commission would be agreed to implement the agreement International financial assistance would be made available for demining reconstruction resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the waraffected regions of NagornoKarabakh The sides would renounce the use or threat of use of force and international and bilateral security guarantees and assurances would be put in place Those provisions correspond very largely to the ones contained in the draft peace settlement proposed by the Minsk Group in MayJuly 1997 the key difference being that the 1997 document contained no specific mention of Kelbacar Practice Makes Perfect The mediators said the conflicting parties would also have to work out practical modalities of the Karabakh referendum Suitable preconditions for such a vote would have to be achieved so that the vote would take place in a noncoercive environment in which wellinformed citizens have had ample opportunity to consider their positions after a vigorous debate in the public arena In a statement released on June 26 the Armenian Foreign Ministry highlighted what it said were further key details and omissions It noted that the cochairs statement did not note the need to grant the NKR intermediate status presumably meaning that it would be under international control until the holding of the referendum on its final status A further gray area not touched upon in the Armenian Foreign Ministry statement is the future status of several districts that prior to 1988 were part of the then NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast but which Azerbaijan took control of in MayJune 1991 expelling the Armenian population The Armenian statement stressed that the cochairs for the first time have affirmed their support for the idea first floated in December 2004 by NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche and former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio of a referendum on Karabakhs status and that the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents have agreed on doing so    Kocharian second from left and Aliyev right with other leaders in Bucharest on June 5 epaIt further said that at the recent meeting in Bucharest on June 45 between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev the Azerbaijani side rejected an unspecified suggestion by the cochairs as to how that remaining area of disagreement could be resolved By contrast the cochairs statement avoided allocating blame for the failure to reach an agreement saying only that the two presidents failed to agree Speaking to journalists in Yerevan on June 29 Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian described the principles under discussion as allencompassing in that they cover all the principles affecting the removal of the military consequences of the conflict He added that only after full agreement on all these basic principles will the parties begin work on elaborating an agreement on the settlement of the conflict In other words the agreement on principles will be comprehensive The final agreement may envision implementation over time Corridor Of Uncertainty Asked to clarify the cochairs reference to special modalities for Lachin and Kelbacar Oskanian explained that the negotiating text specifies that there will be a Lachin corridor linking NagornoKarabakh to Armenia He added that Armenia will insist that that corridor has the same status as Karabakh Oskanian also explained that due to security considerations Kelbacar can be returned only after the referendum is conducted and the final status of NagornoKarabakh is determined  He said this is the point of disagreement between the two sides to which the cochairs referred in their statement to the OSCE Permanent Council last week Oskanian said that the principles stipulate that the vote on Karabakhs status will take place among the population of NagornoKarabakh Some Armenian opposition politicians have expressed concern that the entire population of Azerbaijan would participate in the referendum and vote against Karabakhs independence Asked the Armenian leaderships overall assessment of the principles Oskanian said this is not a perfect document For anyone However there are enough solid and balanced provisions with the right tradeoffs on the main issues  status territories and security  that we are prepared to continue to negotiate on the basis of these principles Noyan Tapan reported But the Karabakh Armenians who to their frustration are excluded from the ArmenianAzerbaijani talks under the Minsk Group aegis are unhappy with at least two of the provisions of the basic principles Even before this weeks disclosures the NKR posted a statement on its website on June 12 citing the arguments against determining the republics future status in a referendum The article reasoned that holding a further referendum would call into question the legality of the referendum of December 10 1991 in which the overwhelming majority of the regions Armenian voters opted for independence from Azerbaijan It noted that most Azerbaijani voters declined to participate in that plebiscite Return To The Front And on June 26 Vahram Atanesian who is chairman of the NKR parliament standing committee on foreign relations was quoted as rejecting the principles as outlined by the Minsk Group cochairs on the grounds that they entail the unequivocal return of the occupied territories  the NKRs sole bargaining chip  in return for a decision at some unspecified future date on the republics status Atanesian said his perception is that the Minsk Group is pressuring Armenia to accept proposals that are fully consistent with Azerbaijans interests  Insofar as Azerbaijan has not definitively rejected the current principles the present situation is reminiscent of that in the summer of 1997 when Armenia accepted albeit with reservations the modified Minsk Group package proposal while Azerbaijan wavered and Stepanakert rejected it outright  The biweekly independent Armenian paper Iravunk on June 27 drew the comparison between the current principles and the 1997 plan but went on to make the point that unlike his predecessor Levon TerPetrossian President Robert Kocharian would never risk publicly making a case for mutual compromise with Azerbaijan Instead the paper suggested Kocharian left it to the Minsk Group cochairs to do soNagornoKarabakhClick on the map to see an enlarged map of

https://www.rferl.org/a/1069546.html,Caucasus Mediator Says Karabakh Peace Requires TradeOffs ,"June 29, 2006 11:20 GMT",,Some of Bryzas comments  particularly about the possible terms of a framework agreement  caused a commotion in Armenia and Azerbaijan with both Foreign ministries commenting on the interview RFERL Washington correspondent Julie Corwin spoke to him again on June 28 about his original interview and what the heads of state need to do to achieve peaceRFERL How surprised were you that the interview caused a stir in the regionMatthew Bryza I was not surprised it caused a stir to tell you the truth because we knew  the cochairs knew  and my predecessor Steven Mann the cochair before I assumed responsibility on the very day of that interview knew that what they had just announced at the OSCE was significant and would make people think twice and would spark as we like to put it a robust debate in the region I was simply in the unenviable position of having been on this newest assignment for an hour and I was the guy that got to explain the decision that others had made before me No I wasnt surprised that a robust debate was sparked What did surprise me though was that people spoke so quickly in reacting to the interview without reading the publicly available document that the cochairs issued at the OSCE in Austria which laid out in much greater detail everythingRFERL Among the responses to your interview have been comments from each side blaming the other for failing to agree to a referendum Which side if any is actually telling the truthBryza We cant go through every single account and every single statement by both sides during this interview obviously but leave it to say that these core principles that were developed over the course of two years by the cochairs and Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and their foreign ministers ultimately werent agreed to by the two presidents So the two presidents share responsibility for not reaching an agreement and I wouldnt say that either is more responsible than the other But its not over either I mean any time they can simply say OK we agree to these core principles or weve agreed to alter them a bit and lets take the packageRFERL In your earlier interview you said it was very unhelpful for either side to discuss the possibility of the resumption of the conflict Nevertheless on Friday of last week June 23 Ilham Aliyev described the efforts of international mediators as hopeless and he said that Azerbaijan would retake NagornoKarabakh by whatever means necessary How do you read his statement Were you disappointed to hear him taking such a belligerent stanceBryza Those statements have been more commonplace than they ought to be and Id stand by what I said last Thursday on June 22 that talk about recapturing Karabakh by force or any use of force by any party is simply not helpful Its not necessary because there is a viable framework on the table that just requires a little bit more political courage on both sides to forge a compromise though I stand by what I said its not helpful RFERL In the statement by the OSCE cochairs you said We see no point now in continuing the intensive shuttle diplomacy which weve engaged in over several months Is that a strategic decision to say were going to back away and hope that that prompts them to renew momentum or is it just exhaustion or frustrationThe two presidents share responsibility for not reaching an agreement and I wouldnt say that either is more responsible than the other Bryza Its a mere statement of fact that my predecessor Steven Mann and my current fellow cochairs have exerted all of the creativity and all the negotiating energy that they could and they have gotten this framework of core principles as honed as possible in their judgment such that the presidents in their mind need a little time to think things over and decide whether or not they can accept or adjust this framework But what were saying in the statement is that there is no more room for diplomatic creativity to make this piece of metal shine a little bit more brightly Its honed and you have to decide whether you want it or not or the tradeoffs that would have to be made are so significant politically that it requires the head of state to make the tradeoffSo were saying OK its yours nowI know these leaders pretty well I like them I hope I can spend a fair amount of time with them doing many things working on Karabakh over the next few months but working on everything I need to do with Azerbaijan and Armenia So I know I personally will have a lot of interaction with them So its not like were going to sit on our hands and nothing is going to happen And were not saying here either that the negotiating process is dead forever What were saying is that weve taken this phase as far as we can and we need guidance now or decisions from the heads of stateRFERL Its been suggested that there are too many strong emotions to melt this frozen conflict And that what is needed in the interim is a reduction of tensions for instance Armenian troops pulling back from the territory around Karabakh Would you advocate thatBryza Its sort of circular to say that an agreement wasnt reached because the time wasnt right or the tensions were too high That is a statement of fact yes So then the question is how can we reduce tension because everybody agrees its good to reduce the tension Would an Armenian troop pullout reduce tension Well sure as hell it would Thats why its a core element of our core principles But the Armenians arent just going to pull back the troops because we say Golly gee that would help reduce tension Theyll do it if they get something for it and thats precisely what these core principles are all aboutRFERL Is there anything you would like to identify that would be reciprocal to a removal of Armenian troopsBryza I would just point you to the statement Its very clear and lays out in a lot of detail what exactly the overall set of tradeoffs would be Demilitarization is the phrase used for troop pullback and that as the framework indicates should be or could be accompanied by some sort of process that would lead to a population vote or a referendum vote on the future status of Karabakh I think thats in the Armenian mindset extremely important so thats what the Azerbaijani side would have to offer the Armenians along with the other things within this statement to which I refer you On the Azerbaijani side I think that they are willing to consider the possibility of some type of a vote on the status of Karabakh if many other elements of this overall package are present What gets difficult is how you correlate the withdrawal or the redeployment of Armenian troops with the timing of a vote on the future status of Karabakh RFERL Will the issue of Karabakh or other frozen conflicts be on the agenda of the G8Bryza Well I personally hope so parochially I saw that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced today that they will be He said that at least for the foreign ministers that several of the G8 foreign ministers have pressed for NagornoKarabakh as well as South Ossetia Abkhazia and Transdniester to be on the G8 agenda And he said because of that they will be So I guess I can say yeah it appears they will be and we have very much wanted all these conflicts to be on the agenda The NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict zoneIn February 1988 the local

regionRFERL Your post  deputy assistant secretary  is more senior than those occupied by previous US cochairs of the Minsk Group Does that mean the United States is paying more attention to the Karabakh question Could that in turn mean that there is a sense the sides are coming closer to resolving this conflict Matthew Bryza I wouldnt read too much in particular into the fact that you now have a deputy assistant secretary rather than someone who wasnt doing this A lot of this just depended on personalities and my own background Ive been so deeply involved in the region for a long time It made sense that I would be the person to pick this up because it was time for Ambassador Mann coincidentally to move on to his next assignment So thats all I wouldnt read anything more into it Im just very happy that Ill be able to play a more active  and in fact daily  role on this conflict and make sure those efforts are integrated with all the other broader things Im trying to do in the Caucasus We just dont know where the presidents are right now Were encouraging them were nudging them by taking a step back Nudging them to show that they have this political willRFERL You have said in recent statements that there is a framework on the table that makes an agreement on Karabakh possible You have also said that next year the political calendar will be more complicated in Armenia and therefore the presidents should do something this year while there is still a window of opportunity First of all what kind of framework is that And do you still believe there is room for a resolution this year Some experts say the issue is already very complicated today even before we get into the elections next year Bryza It is complicated today We see how complicated the situation is based upon the fact that the presidents havent gotten to the point where theyve agreed to this framework thats on the table That gets back to the first part of your question What we have is a framework agreement as we described today here at the OSCE  as Ambassador Mann did and Ambassador Yury Merzlyakov the Russian cochair and Bernard Fassier the French cochair as well  we have a framework agreement that would call for the removal or the withdrawal of Armenian troops from those territories in Azerbaijan where they currently are Thats on the one side On the other side we have a normalization of Armenias ties  economic diplomatic  and other features having to do with peacekeepers and international economic assistance to the Karabakh region and economic development So theres a package proposal on the table that in the end would involve as well a vote at some point on the future status of Karabakh So thats kind of the basic outline of the proposal on the table and we would very much encourage the presidents to accept this framework Which requires a lot of political courage which Ive said publicly before A Breakthrough This Year  The NagornoKarabakh army conducts military exercises in 2005 PhotolurRFERL Have you noticed any sign that the two sides may be softening their positions Did they appear more willing to consider the framework agreement youre describing during their talks in early June at a Black Sea summit in Bucharest than they were when they meant for talks in February with the French president in Rambouillet Bryza Put it this way At Bucharest they talked throughout the whole meeting to each other really went through the issues in detail and they havent issued any negative statements really since So Im not sure how to interpret that I know what I hope what the cochairs hope The cochairs hope that this reflects political will on the part of the presidents to really get serious about some tough compromises each side will make Im not sure if thats where they are and the cochairs talked today about taking a bit of a pause throughout the summer to find out whether or not the presidents do in fact have that sort of political will RFERL What is the next step for the cochairs Are you planning to bring the presidents together again after the summer Bryza At this point as I was saying the cochairs have decided to take a pause throughout the summer We will reconvene in September October to report back here to Vienna the headquarters of the OSCE I hope But were taking some time off in terms of trying to facilitate meetings between the presidents Its really up to the presidents now to decide whether or not they want to take the politically difficult and challenging decisions that are critical to bringing the framework agreement home So were giving them some space and we want them to demonstrate that they really do have the political will to take these next difficult steps That doesnt mean were quitting the process That doesnt mean were walking away from it I myself still have to make my first trips in this capacity to Yerevan and Baku and you can bet that Ill be encouraging the presidents to take these tough decisions And there will be opportunities at major international gatherings this summer to discuss this issue RFERL At the turn of the year there were a lot of optimistic statements  from you as well as others  that the Karabakh conflict could be resolved in 2006 Were now halfway through the year Are you still optimistic about 2006Bryza I dont know My optimism if you look carefully at my statements was about the fact that there is a framework on the table that provides a workable foundation for a just and lasting settlement I was optimistic that the Minsk Group negotiators had gotten the two presidents as close as they could get to an agreement without the presidents taking some very difficult decisions and making some very difficult compromises We are still in that same place I dont know if thats optimistic or pessimistic But the Minsk Group itself has decided that theres no sense in us trying to arrange another round of presidential meetings or trying to broker an agreement because we have taken the process as far as we can and all thats left to do is for the presidents to make these tough decision Is that pessimistic I dont know if it is It depends on what the presidents themselves decide to do next If they decide that they simply dont have the political will to keep going well thats a pessimistic outcome But we just dont know where the presidents are right now Were encouraging them were nudging them by taking a step back Nudging them to show that they have this political will Russias Role In The South Caucasus  A Russian tank embarks at Batumi on the start of its journey out of Georgia ITARTASSRFERL Russia does not always play what some would consider a constructive role in the South Caucasus particularly with regard to the frozen conflicts in the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia But Russia has been very cooperative with the United States on NagornoKarabakh Some Russian officials like Sergei Ivanov have occasionally said there should be no Karabakh resolution imposed from abroad But otherwise the relationship has been constructive How would you evaluate relations between the United States and Russia with respect to Karabakh in particular and the Caucasus in generalBryza First let me say you made a statement of fact with which I agree We are working quite well with Russia on Karabakh Our level of cooperation has not been as significant when it comes to South Ossetia and Abkhazia and Transdniester I dont work on Transdniester a separatist region of Moldova but I was just in Abkhazia and I think there is a lot of room for much better cooperation  and I would argue that the Georgian side has shown a significant amount of goodwill and a readiness to work on significant confidencebuilding measures I would also say the United States has worked hard to keep the Georgians as constructive and moderate as possible and I hope our Russians colleagues and friends will do the same in terms of encouraging the Abkhaz to be constructive and moderate I saw today that Sergei Bagapsh the leader of the authorities of Abkhazia issued a rather incendiary statement threatening to put mines along the Line of Contact between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia Thats the last thing that needs to be happening right nowWe dont see that happening in the case of Karabakh I leave that to analysts like yourselves to figure out why that may be Geographic differences perhaps Where Karabakh is placed I dont know what the reason is Maybe its because the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan themselves have demonstrated a commitment to work in a constructive way  although I would argue the Georgians have done so as well But we are working quite well with the Russians and especially with the Russian cochair Ambassador Merzlyakov Hes a creative and constructive diplomat whom Ive known for a long time ever since we worked together on Caspian energy issues The US Interest In NagornoKarabakhRFERL Your predecessor Ambassador Mann said repeatedly that the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 2001 created pressure to resolve the Karabakh conflict in order to put an end to one source of instability in the region Even so highlevel involvement on the part of the United States has not materialized How does NagornoKarabakh fit into US security interestsBryza I think Steve Mann is right to say that any time we have an area that could become a gray area on the map where nefarious transactions or transit of goods and materials could transpire because of legal grayness Thats a potential threat Where does Karabakh fit into our broad national security calculus Well hopefully there will be a discussion of it at the G8 summit of the eight leading industrialized nations to be held in midJuly in St Petersburg The G8 one could argue may be the worlds most elite grouping of states and political leaders So if we have a discussion on Karabakh at the G8  along with a discussion of Abkhazia South Ossetia Transdniester  that would imply it figures pretty prominently on our agenda But were still working out the agenda of the G8 RFERL So its not yet clear if Karabakh will be included The Washington Post has reported that the Georgian and Moldovan conflicts would be discussed but Karabakh will not beBryza I dont believe that will be the case We are working with our secretary of state  we have already recommended to her that she raise all of those conflicts at the ministerial meeting in Moscow on June 29 Undersecretary Nicholas Burns has already made that suggestion a couple of times And so we would like to make sure all of those conflicts are on the agenda RFERL There is always the lingering possibility that the conflict could resume Both sides have made attempts to raise their military budgets That is particularly the case with Azerbaijan How would the international community react to either side attempting to shift the balance of power away from the status quo Bryza Youve put me in that classic situation of having to answer a hypothetical question So I wont answer that question directly What I will say is what Ive been working on with my friends in the government of Azerbaijan  because thats the side where you most often hear those sorts of threats thats a fact  and what I feel the government of Azerbaijan doing as well is focusing on the positive aspects of Azerbaijans burgeoning wealth thats going to come from the energy sector Its really quite unhelpful to make statements that imply that this increased wealth is going to lead to purchases of arms and military threats Its quite constructive however to talk about how this wealth can open new channels of cooperation how such wealth would provide Azerbaijan an opportunity to invest in the wellbeing of the region how it could help develop Karabakh all the territories create the opportunities for business for commerce and for the ethnic Armenians and Azeris to come together and get to know each other and therefore over time to reduce the level of tension and the level of animosity surrounding the status question of Karabakh So I guess what Im saying is theres really no reason to expect that armed conflict will come out this Its really unwise even to talk about it and we urge the sides not even to think about it The United States The Caucasus And OilRFERL The United States clearly has strategic interests in Azerbaijan not least Caspian oil Does the United States look at the NagornoKarabakh conflict in the context of its energy interests Bryza Throughout the Caucasus we have three sets of strategic interests These are valid in all three countries Yes we have energy interests and were not embarrassed to say that energy is a strategic interest We have pure security interests or traditional security interests  meaning fighting terrorism fighting proliferation avoiding military conflict and restoring or preserving in some cases the territorial integrity of the states of the region What I really mean is resolving the conflicts in the case of Georgia within Georgias international boundaries in the case of Karabakh our official line is we support Azerbaijans territorial integrity And then we have a third set of interests in the internal reform of each country  democratic and market economic reform for all the reasons the US president has articulated based on our belief that stability only comes from legitimacy And legitimacy requires democracy on the political side and prosperity on the economic side and you only get both  democracy and prosperity  through serious reform So all three sets of interests are being pursued by us at any one timeIts diversity we care about  diversity of supply which leads to energy independenceIn Armenia obviously the significance of energy is not the same as in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan is a producer Keep in mind that we Americans will consume little if any of that energy produced in Azerbaijan The energy produced in Azerbaijan matters in terms of its contribution to global energy diversity especially for our European allies So its diversity we care about  diversity of supply which leads to energy independence When it comes to Armenia energy is similarly important in terms of making sure that Armenia has independent or multiple sources of energy supply so that it feels independent and therefore more stable and more willing to negotiate in good faith So thats a long answer to say that of course energy is part of our strategic calculus But thats not whats driving us Were looking for balance And we do recognize however that God forbid if there was a resumption of conflict over Karabakh that that would undermine the entire investment climate across the Caucasus all three countries And we certainly dont want thatArmenia And Regional PowersRFERL The relationship between Turkey and Armenia which is also crucial to regional stability is slowly showing signs of improvement Is the United States actively engaged in trying to help make ties between Ankara and Yerevan warmer Bryza We are working consulting talking strategizing with our friends in both Turkey and in Armenia When it comes to Armenia I think its clear that the Armenian side is willing and ready to move toward normalization I think the same is true in Turkey Besides just encouraging the sides to get together and find a common language I can tell you that what weve tried to do over the last few years is try to develop this particular framework for Karabakh thats on the table Because if the sides are able to implement what the framework indicates  meaning again the withdrawal from the territories in Azerbaijan where Armenian troops are present and then the normalization of diplomatic and economic relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia  then full normalization of Turkish and Armenian relations follows naturally Another way to put it is all of our diplomatic efforts with regards to Karabakh also aim at normalizing Turkish and Armenian relations RFERL A question on the issue of Russian military bases in Armenia Some military hardware was recently moved from Georgia to Armenia There are essentially no Russian troops in Georgia and Azerbaijan but there is a significant presence in Armenia How does the United States view that Will you ask the Armenian government to ask the Russians to withdraw Bryza First of all lets be clear that there are Russian troops in Georgia They have not all withdrawn yet from military bases at Akhalkalaki or Batumi They are on the way the heavy equipment is moving And there will be Russian troops in the context of the CIS peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia for some time depending on how the discussions go between Russia and Georgia When it comes to the movement of the heavy equipment from Akhalkalaki to Gyumri site of a Russian base in Armenia no were not asking Armenia to press for the removal of those Russian bases We didnt ask the Georgians to do that We respect the sovereignty of our friends be they Georgia Azerbaijan or Armenia and its up to those sovereign governments to take their own decisions We simply welcome the fact that Russia and Georgia have agreed mutually that Russian bases will close down That was Georgias expressed ambition Russia agreed Thats simply a good thing But its not for us to try to encourage the removal of the basesPromoting Democracy  One of many Azerbaijanis who claimed Novemberss parliamentary elections were rigged ITARTASSRFERL Neither Azerbaijan nor Armenia have had truly democratic elections in the past 10 years So can we say these governments have the mandate the popular support to make the difficult decisions outlined in the framework agreement Bryza Certainly they have the mandate if they build popular support I think thats the most important next step Ive been talking about the fact that the presidents need to take tough decisions And to get to the tough decision they need to prepare their populations for a compromise Thats another way of saying they either build or do have that mandate You raise a good question about the legitimacy of a government depending on its elections I would argue that the pace of democracy in both of those countries isnt a disaster A lot more work needs to be done But in the case of Azerbaijans parliamentary elections in November 2005 there were some significant improvements in this last round of elections But they didnt go as far as we would like RFERL How serious is the United States about promoting democracy in Azerbaijan We see your serious efforts in Georgia and we see the results But in Azerbaijan the international community seriously criticized the elections but the United States decided to invite President Ilham Aliyev to Washington What makes Aliyev different for example from an autocratic leader like Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka Bryza I categorically reject the statement that the United States isnt serious about democracy in Azerbaijan As President Bush said in his second inaugural address longterm security requires democracy Its the thirst for political and economic freedom that is the most powerful motivating factor in international politics That really is the source of longterm stability We fool ourselves if we think that we can achieve our longterm interests in any country  be they energy interests or security interests  and turn away from democracy You talked about September 11 Well the great lesson we learned from September 11 is that we were wrong as the president has said for 50 years We looked at the Middle East and said these countries are too strategically important for us to focus on democracyJust because Azerbaijan hasnt gone as far as we would like on democracy doesnt mean were going to ignore our energy interests or our military interestsSo we understand that longterm security and therefore the ability to achieve our energy interests requires democracy In Azerbaijan we have pressed very hard on democracy You said the international community was critical of the Azeri elections  well were part of that community and our statements were critical However we have to make a judgment at some point whether or not we think the trend in a country is positive or negative And we dont have unidimensional relations with countries either I talked about three sets of interests Just because Azerbaijan hasnt gone as far as we would like on democracy doesnt mean were going to ignore our energy interests or our military interests Thats not to say that our energy interests or our military interests or our counterterrorism interests are driving us to ignore democracy I said before we have to pursue a balance Why would we freeze out President Ilham Aliyev from contact with our president forever because we think he needs to do more on democracy That doesnt make sense Our president made a judgment His judgment was that we could do more to elicit democratic reform in Azerbaijan by embracing Ilham Aliyev right now rather than freezing him out Thats because we do feel the trend on democracy is positive even if Azerbaijan hasnt gone as far as we wish So finally Id say there is simply no similarity between Lukashenka and Aliyev We just dont feel there is at all Ilham Aliyev we believe is working to modernize the political system of Azerbaijan to create democracy in the context of Azerbaijans culture and traditions  which the president said is necessary because democracy looks different in every country That said they havent gone far enough And we will continue to press President Aliyev  and his opposition as well  to behave constructively to build and strengthen democratic institutions as we pursue our full range of interests RFERL Ilham Aliyev has been to Washington Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been invited to the White House just ahead of the G8 Are there any plans to invite Armenias President Robert Kocharian as well Bryza We obviously dont look at balancing presidential meetings like that but theres no reason not to want President Kocharian to come to Washington Let me just say I hope we can see a similar series of positive steps on democratic reform in Armenia as we hope we are starting to see in Azerbaijan Maybe were wrong about Azerbaijan Maybe were overly hopeful But we think things are moving in a positive direction And we hope to see more of that from Armenia We signaled our support for Armenia quite dramatically with the Millennium Challenge Account a development fund set by the United States whose recipients  including Armenia  are chosen using competitive reformbased criteria That is in many ways one of our highest forms of stating that we seek a partnership with a country to help it move forward on democratic reform So we began that program this year When we began it we issued a letter saying we really had problems with the way the constitutional referendum was conducted in November 2005 and were waiting to see positive changes implemented So thats kind of the key to the next steps in our relationshipThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1069083.html,NagornoKarabakh What Is The Sticking Point In The Peace Talks ,"June 12, 2006 12:00 GMT",But the Bucharest talks like the two presidents previous meeting in Rambouillet in early February failed to make progress on resolving what Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian subsequently called the most serious difference between the two sides,But the Bucharest talks like the two presidents previous meeting in Rambouillet in early February failed to make progress on resolving what Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian subsequently called the most serious difference between the two sidesAll the officials involved in the search for a solution to the Karabakh conflict whether representing the conflict sides or the mediators have remained tightlipped in recent months over the precise issues under discussion That atmosphere of confidentiality has been alleviated only by occasional enigmatic statements and disclosures But the intensification of the Minsk Groups efforts in the wake of the February talks in Rambouillet also reflects a growing sense of urgency Upcoming ElectionsArmenia is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in 2007 and presidential elections are due in both countries in 2008 In the runup to those elections neither leadership dare agree to a humiliating concession that could alienate voters For that reason the Minsk Group cochairs desperately want the two sides to agree on at least a preliminary draft accord before the perceived window of opportunity closes at the end of this year While the notion of a window of opportunity is now in question it does reflect a very real linkage between the peace talks and the electoral cycle of all parties involved And that linkage in turn reveals the rather troubling failure of both the Armenian and Azerbaijani governments to adequately engage and prepare their societies for any possible settlement Azerbaijani officials have repeatedly ruled out any solution that does not preserve the countrys territorial integrity They would therefore be reluctant to permit a referendum on the future status of the NKR in which the predominantly Armenian population would doubtless opt for independence Indeed the current constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic expressly precludes holding a referendum on altering the countrys borders A second disturbing factor is that the leadership of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR remains dangerously excluded from the toplevel negotiations relying instead on Armenian good faith and prudence to defend their interests It seems only natural to presuppose at least a degree of divergence in the national interests of Armenia and NagornoKarabakh But notwithstanding windows of opportunity the ongoing talks and meetings are important in themselves to maintaining a degree of dialogue and engagement and in demonstrating to the population of both countries their respective leaders commitment to resolving the conflict on the most advantageous terms possible MeetingsAs noted above two meetings within four months between Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev failed to yield progress on the most intractable difference between the two sides The issue the two presidents discussed and tried to solve is very complicated indeed RFERLs Armenian Service quoted Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian as telling journalists in Yerevan on June 6 This was the same issue that was put before the presidents at Rambouillet It wasnt solved then and it wasnt solved now either   Kocharian left and Aliyev have met several times over the last year Photolur Noyan Tapan quoted Oskanian as implying that reconciling the two sides respective positions is all the more difficult because it requires a retreat from fundamental principles But he said he will very probably meet again very soon with his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov in a bid to narrow the differences between the two sides Unconfirmed reports say such a meeting might take place as early as this weekOskanian failed to identify the pivotal issue that is precluding progress in the peace process but statements by other officials substantiate the hypothesis that the nexus of the problem lies in the concessions each side is or is not ready to make Most analysts assume that the variant currently under discussion is that originally proposed in late 2004 by NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche and former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio That plan envisages a compromise settlement that would give Armenia temporary control of the unrecognized NKR in exchange for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territory with the final status of Karabakh to be determined by its inhabitants in a referendum in five or 10 years time The International Crisis Group unveiled a similar plan last fallSolutions ConcessionsThe major obstacle to either of those plans is that Azerbaijani officials have repeatedly ruled out any solution that does not preserve the countrys territorial integrity They would therefore be reluctant to permit a referendum on the future status of the NKR in which the predominantly Armenian population would doubtless opt for independence Indeed the current constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic expressly precludes holding a referendum on altering the countrys borders On June 6 ArmRadioam as cited by Groong quoted Mammadyarov as stressing that point and also as arguing that not only the Armenian population of NagornoKarabakh but also its former Azerbaijani community should be given autonomy under any peace settlementAs for Armenia the real question is whether when and in return for what reciprocal concession from Azerbaijan it should relinquish its sole bargaining chip by withdrawing from the seven districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to the NKR that have been occupied by Karabakh Armenian forces since 1993 Yerevan reportedly has no objection to freeing five of those districts  Jebrayil Fizuli Zangelan Agdam and Gubadla  but has been reluctant to cede control of the strategic Lachin corridor that serves as the sole overland road link between the NKR and Armenia or the neighboring Kelbajar district Retaining such a lifeline is one of the three key tenets of the Armenian negotiating position US Deputy Secretary of State Daniel Frieds comment in Bucharest on June 5 that we would like to see the return of as much territory as possible to Azerbaijan as soon as possible and the return of Azerbaijanis to their native villages implies precisely such a disagreement between the two sides over how many districts Armenia will cede and the time frame for doing so And the Karabakh leadership may well take a harder line than Yerevan on any withdrawal from occupied territory thereby narrowing the Armenian room for maneuver In that respect progress in resolving the conflict may ultimately hinge on the ability of the OSCE  or the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1069032.html,South Caucasus EU Special Representative Hopeful On Karabakh ,"June 09, 2006 13:09 GMT",,RFERL What is your outlook on the NagornoKarabakh conflict Are you hopeful the issue will be resolved  Peter Semneby Ive been asked very often in the last few months whether Im an optimist or a pessimist regarding NagornoKarabakh and relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan I would say that Im neither I dont want to say that Im an optimist because so far its always been the pessimists who have been proven right in this conflict Still one should always maintain hope and Im still hopeful that this conflict will be resolved soon This is a very good moment for the region Its a time when there are no major domestic considerations in the countries Its also a time when the European Union is taking a much stronger interest in the region something that is demonstrated by the inclusion of all of the Southern Caucasus countries into the European Neighborhood Policy  RFERL The International Crisis Group recently came out with a report urging the EU to be more engaged in conflict resolution in the region because it has the best leverage there both financially and institutionally Do you agree that the EU should put a priority on this issue  Semneby There is a lot that the European Union can do The EU sent a political signal when it changed the mandate of the Special Representative from a rather passive role in terms of conflict resolution to one where he is expected to contribute to conflict resolution That change of wording may not change very much in practical terms but it is an important political signal What happens in the Southern Caucasus is no longer something abstract and distant It is becoming an area of direct concern to the EU  What is changing in practice are the resources and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal When the European Neighborhood Policy starts to take effect with the new financial perspective of the European Union in 2007 there will be considerable resources available for various activities not least those related to conflict resolution and support of the development and rehabilitation of the conflict areas    A young ethnic Armenian recruit being put through training in 1992 TASSAlready at this stage if there is a resolution if there is an agreement between the parties there are considerable rapidreaction funds that the EU can also put at the disposal of the two governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan to repair what has been broken by the conflictRFERL NagornoKarabakh isnt an easy conflict to resolve Attempts so far have not been successful and may continue to be unsuccessful for many years to come Why has the EU decided that now is the time to become involved in conflict resolution  Semneby  The reasons why the EU is more interested now than in the past has to do of course with the change of the environment in which we are living The European Union is enlarging Very soon it will have two members bordering on the Black Sea Romania and Bulgaria The EU has started to negotiate for membership with Turkey That changes the perspective What happens in the Southern Caucasus is no longer something abstract and distant It is becoming an area of direct concern to the EU  Its also an area that is important for energy resources Its important because its close to very volatile regions to the south The Middle East all the problems that were facing with Iran also have focused attention on the Southern Caucasus And its also an important aspect of EU relations with our biggest and most important partner country in the East and that is Russia  RFERL In the EURussia summit in Sochi on May 25 the Caucasus reportedly figured in the discussions What specifically did you talk about Do you find there are instances where Russia is heavyhanded in its policy on this area and if so do you express your concern  Semneby When the Caucasus is discussed with Russia the three frozen conflicts that we have in the area are obviously high on the agenda These conflicts  in particular the ones in Georgia  are a direct issue in our relations with Russia  What I hope and believe is that we will be able to resolve the two conflicts in Georgia together with Russia because I fundamentally believe that it is in Russias interests to have stable neighbors along all its borders and neighbors with which it maintains predictable and friendly relations And only when the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been resolved once and for all will the problematic relationship between Russia and Georgia become normal  RFERL How much do you engage in dialogue with the South Caucasus governments on democracy issues There are those in Azerbaijan for example who say that the EU and other Western powers arent doing enough to remind the government of its commitment to promote democracy and respect human rights How do you respond to such criticism    NagornoKarabakh army in training 2005 PhotolurSemneby Fundamentally we regard the countries in the South Caucasus as partners And what you have to do with partners is you have to discuss the issues and you have to agree on what needs to be done That takes some time because our thinking has developed in different contexts historically and otherwise  Through an intensive relationship over the course of the last few years I do think that we have come to a common understanding of what the standards are that need to be fulfilled The proof of that is that we have in fact agreed more or less on quite extensive Action Plans to implement the European Neighborhood Policy which includes the most important parts of the EU acquis communitaire the European Unions body of laws in terms of democracy human rights rule of law and so on This is the first step We will have the Action Plans very soon Im convinced that the last parts of the negotiations will be done very soon and they will be signed That marks a new step in our relations when the focus will be on the implementation of those Action Plans  RFERL The Council of Europe for one says Azerbaijan still has political prisoners  a violation of Bakus international obligations Some observers say the South Caucasus leaders are engaging with the West in order to stay in power but arent truly committed to democratic reforms So what guarantee is there that these Action Plans will be signed  Semneby I think that the EU has proven in other cases that it does have a considerable transformational power and I very strongly believe that through the carrots and sticks that the EU will have at its disposal as part of the Action Plans that there will be such a transformational power in the Southern Caucasus  That is not to say it will be easy We have seen many of the most difficult issues in other countries that have acceded to the European Union only being resolved at the very final stages  This is an issue  since we dont have a membership perspective in the European Neighborhood Policy one of the most important carrots is not present But I think there are still enough instruments of the same kind that have been very successfully applied in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that can also be used in the South CaucasusThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict zoneIn

Transdniester to South Ossetia to Abkhazia separatist regions in the former Soviet Union are rushing to praise the Montenegrin independence vote  and to hold it up as a model that they would like to follow A Civilized ModelSergei Bagapsh the president of Georgias breakaway Abkhazia region praised what he called Montenegros civilized method of gaining selfdetermination Likewise Yevgeny Shevchuk  the speaker of separatist Transdniesters parliament  told RFERLs RomaniaMoldova Service that people there have the right to hold a similar vote  if not for independence then at least for autonomyIf we are going to proceed according to the principles of human rights and create conditions for a better life on the dignified level of Europeans in the 21st century then we need to go down this path Shevchuk said We have a historic opportunityBut there are big differences between Montenegro and these postSoviet separatist regionsMontenegros leadership enjoys wide legitimacy and the republic is considered a good international citizenMoreover Montenegros independence referendum was held with clear rules under the watchful eye of the European Union and with Serbias acquiescence There were no serious fears of violence The Threat Of ViolenceBy contrast the threat of unrest is never far off in Abkhazia or South Ossetia whose relations with the Georgian government in Tbilisi are often openly hostile Transdniester likewise has poor ties with Chisinau And all three regions are widely viewed as lawless safe havens for smugglers and organizedcrime groups   A Russian peacekeeper patrols the border between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia TASS file photoAll three are also strongly supported by Russia which has been accused of exploiting the conflicts to maintain leverage in its relations with proWestern Georgia and Moldova Georgia is working hard to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia back into its fold and resents what it sees as Russian meddling on its territoryIn an interview with RFERLs Georgian Service Irakli Menagarishvili a former Georgian foreign minister and currently the head of the countrys Center for Strategic Studies warned the international community against applying the Montenegrin model to trouble spots in the former USSRNo Single SolutionDrawing parallels here is not only unacceptable but also dangerous Menagarishvili said Cases like these have their specific historical political and other dimensions Hence each of them has to be considered and solved separately Any attempt at generalization or universalization is to repeat once again not only unacceptable but also dangerousOne breakaway region in the former Soviet Union where an independence referendum proved problematic was the ethnicArmenian enclave of NagornoKarabakh in Azerbaijan Many in NagornoKarabakh feel that residents of the region were punished for voting for independence in 1991  paying with their lives in the war that ensued How Could Referendums WorkSo with all these differences can Montenegros smooth transition nevertheless serve as a model for resolving any of the stubborn frozen conflicts in the former Soviet UnionKarel De Gucht the OSCEs chairman in office thinks it can  but only if all sides agree in advance to respect the resultYou can only have that kind of referendum if all parties agree about the referendum and agree about the outcome of the referendum de Gucht said That is why the proposal of the international community by Ambassador Miroslav Lajcak  that you should have at least 55 percent of the people voting in favor in Montenegro  was an important element because it was also accepted by all parties concerned A referendum where first of all the organization of and second the result the outcome are not guaranteed beforehand can also be very divisive So it can be a solution provided that everybody agrees to accept the resultLikewise Alexander Rahr an expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union at the German Council of Foreign Relations said holding a referendum is the fairest and most democratic way to resolve such issues  But for independence votes to work they must be held under free fair and open conditions  circumstances that are conspicuously absent in Transdniester Abkhazia and South OssetiaMoreover Rahr pointed out that Russia might try to manipulate the results of referendums in the proMoscow regionsIn Montenegro a referendum could be held in a real democratic way under the supervision of Western democratic institutions Rahr said That may not be the case in Abkhazia South Ossetia or Transdniester where there is a fear these results could be forged and controlled by RussiaFor its part Russia will likely be careful about pushing the Montenegro model too far Citing Montenegro as a Westernendorsed precedent may suit the Kremlins needs in Georgia and Moldovas separatist regions But Moscow would be unlikely to endorse such a scenario on its own territory  most notably in

https://www.rferl.org/a/1068498.html,Armenia French Lawmakers Debate Sensitive Genocide Bill ,"May 18, 2006 16:41 GMT",In the view of its authors the proposed onearticle draft bill is designed to complement a 2001 law that recognizes the 191517 mass killings as genocide,In the view of its authors the proposed onearticle draft bill is designed to complement a 2001 law that recognizes the 191517 mass killings as genocideThe singlesentence law reads that France publicly recognizes the Armenian genocide of 1915 French parliamentarians at the time noted that the text was largely symbolic since it did not allow for the prosecution of those who deny the 1915 massacre was genocideThe authors of the new draft bill seek to rectify that omissionIf approved the legislation could make contesting the veracity of Armenian genocide claims punishable by five years in jail or a fine of 45000 euros approximately 58000France already has a law making it a crime to deny the Holocaust That law passed in 1972 was later expanded to cover other crimes against humanity as defined at the end of World War IIThe present draft bill was coauthored by a group of Socialist legislators that includes Christophe Masse and Didier MigaudAddressing the assembly Masse said criminalizing the denial of the Armenian genocide would make victims of the Ottomanera killings and the Holocaust equal before the law By adopting this bill the National Assembly would confirm its commitment to justice and democracy By making this strong gesture it will help ease the unhealthy rivalry that exists among victims of various genocides and that is fueled by their inequality before the lawMigaud in turn argued that criminalizing Armenian genocide denial claims is a question of ethicsAfter we recognized the Armenian genocide could we possibly accept that its denial goes unpunished on our territory By accepting that wouldnt we relinquish our obligation to remember Wouldnt we be a party to censorship Wouldnt we more simply accept an official history that was written by those who refuse to recognize not merely a historical reality but also a historical truth Migaud saidHistorical OpinionMost Western historians agree that the death of at least 1 million Ottoman Armenians in 1915 and the years that followed was orchestrated by the wartime Young Turk government and was the result of a genocidal policyAlthough a number of Young Turk officials were tried by Ottoman courts after the 1918 armistice for their participation in the Armenian massacres modern Turkeys successive governments have persistently denied all genocide claims brought against their Ottoman predecessorsTurkish historians and officials argue that the 191517 Armenian massacres were the result of war operations and civil strife not of a deliberate extermination policy They also claim much fewer than 1 million Armenians were killedThe issue remains a taboo in todays Turkey  and there it is those who back the genocide claims who face criminal persecution EU And TurkeyMany EU politicians insist that Turkey must recognize the Armenian genocide before it can join the European Union As French parliamentarian Migaud put it Ankara must follow in the tracks of other states and reconcile with its past Yet he said that does not mean Ankara should be held responsible for massacres that took place 90 years agoDoes his draft law mean that we intend to hold Turkey responsible for the Armenian genocide Certainly not This is not a judgment on our part but we would like to tell the Turks that a nation a country does not become weaker when it recognizes its past Migaud saidTurkey has warned that if adopted the proposed bill would harm its relations with France Ankara voiced similar threats when the National Assembly debated its first Armenian genocide bill five years ago However the economic sanctions that followed that French vote were soon lifted and had no lasting impact on bilateral tiesAddressing the French parliament today Foreign Minister Philippe DousteBlazy however argued that making the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime would harm Frances interestsIf the draft presented to you today were to be adopted it would be considered an unfriendly gesture by a vast majority of the Turkish people This would inevitably have serious political consequences and weaken our influence not only in Turkey itself but also beyond in the whole region DousteBlazy said DousteBlazy further argued that the legislation would  if passed  hamper the normalization of ties between Turkey and Armenia and even hinder international efforts to find a peaceful resolution of the 18yearold NagornoKarabakh conflictFrance cochairs the Minsk Group of nations that has been mandated by the OSCE to help Armenians and Azeris  who are Turkeys ethnic kin  find a diplomatic solution to their territorial disputeReferring to an earlier controversial parliamentary debate on Frances colonial past DousteBlazy also urged legislators to not interfere with the work of historians You then agreed that it was up to historians  and historians alone  to establish the truth on past events and shape our collective memory It seems to me that by attempting to back away from this rule of common sense this assembly again runs the risk of seeing the legislator interfere in the writing of national historyDousteBlazys plea prompted a swift response from the floorProgovernment parliamentarian Roland Blum who supports the draft bill objected that neither Turkish government officials nor Turkish historians are ready to come to terms with their pastTurkey has not relinquished its nationalism It has not relinquished Turkism which served as an ideology for the 1915 ethnic cleansing It has no plans to recognize the Armenian genocide quite the contrary In 2005 the Faculty of Medicine in Istanbul has asked Germany permission to repatriate the remains of Dr Behaeddin Sakir the ideologue of the genocide so that they be officially reburied in Turkey probably next to Talat Pasha the man who organized the Armenian genocide and who has his own mausoleum there Blum saidBlum was the last lawmaker to take the floorParliament Speaker JeanLouis Debre who opposes the draft indefinitely adjourned the debate after only 45 minutes of discussion The next hearings will reportedly not take place until this autumn at the earliest

told a Council of Europe hearing in Brussels today that the blocs European Neighborhood Policy ENP would make a separate Stability Pact redundant Representatives from Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia were also lukewarm in their support for the idea The EU was expected to be the Stability Pacts chief sponsor But now the project  first floated by regional leaders at the 1999 Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE  now appears defunct Robert Liddell a senior official with the EUs executive European Commission told todays hearing  held by the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  he does not consider the project an improvement on the EUs existing policyI dont see much difference between what people are talking about in the Stability Pact and what the ENP is offering he said If you then build in other aspects of the European Union policy of its security strategy and other aspects of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy  those may not be part of the ENP exactly but they are flanking policies that lead to a total package from the European Union Liddell said the ENP already embodies a statement of the EUs desire for stability good governance and economic reforms in the South CaucasusNot The BalkansSpeaking on behalf the EU member states the newly appointed special representative for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby discouraged parallels between the proposed pact and the successful EUbacked Stability Pact for Southeastern EuropeSemneby said most progress made in the Balkan countries would not have been possible without the overwhelming incentive of EU membership  something the South Caucasus countries dont haveAn EU membership perspective is not present in the Southern Caucasus unlike the Balkans he said It is indeed the European membership perspective that has played the most important role in the Balkans in terms of reforms that have been undertakenSemneby also noted that the South Caucasus is a far more unstable region with its lingering frozen conflicts and Russias continued influence Caspian Energy LinkBoth Semneby and Liddell indicated the EU also prefers to see the South Caucasus in a wider context This is partly due to the active interest taken in the region by key countries such as the United States Russia Turkey and Iran But the EUs evolving quest for energy security also plays an important role Liddell said the EU views the Black Sea region as integrally linked to the Caspian Sea and energy reserves in Central AsiaThe representatives of Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan present at todays hearing appeared lukewarm at best in their support for the idea of a Stability PactGeorgias ambassador to the EU Salome Samadashvili said her country is keen to follow its own path toward integration with the EU and NATO unencumbered by regional commitmentsWe Georgia do see ourselves as the crucial link between the  if you wish  the more stable Black Sea region and the Southern Caucasus and we are ready to do what we can in order to strengthen stability in the region strengthen regional cooperation she said However as the Georgian government has mentioned many times we will not be captive to any regional approach and Georgian society will move forward steadily on the course which it has chosen pursuing closer links

NagornoKarabakhVaruzhan Nessissian head of the Armenian Foreign Ministrys department for the OSCE said his country sees mainly economic benefits in a possible Stability Pact But he said Armenias support to the project remains qualified and will depend on its acceptance by other countries as well as a promise of eventual EU membershipWe do believe in Armenia that such an arrangement is possible and workable if at least two preconditions are met he said First there must be strong political will on the part of the countries in the region to enter into a longterm stability arrangement notwithstanding existing problems between some of them Second as in the case of the Stability Pact for the Balkans there should be some concrete and eventual European membership prospect in a reasonable time frame With these two in place the Stability Pact for the South Caucasus has a chance to happenAzerbaijans ambassador to the EU Arif Mammadarov said Armenias withdrawal from Azerbaijani territory is key to any prospects of regional cooperationWithout the fundamental principle of respect for each other within our identified territories  which are internationally recognized territories  without this principle without recognizing each others houses to be good neighbors is impossible he said The first principle is the recognition of the internationally recognized borders of each otherAlthough the EU appears to have dashed hopes for a South Caucasus Stability Pact its involvement in the region will grow significantly with the impending signature of ENP action plans with

Russian airtraffic controllers But such claims may only be the cover for deeper concerns about the impending advance of the Russian gas giant Gazprom and growing racism in Russia directed in part at natives of the Caucasus Hmayak Hovhanisian the chairman of the Armenian Association of Political Scientists says it is too early to tell if the controversy will have a lasting impact on relations between the two countriesIt depends on how the investigation proceeds he notes If the black boxes arent recovered and the real causes of the disaster arent explained in a way that is clear for everyone it will have a negative effect on RussianArmenian relationsInvestigation OngoingRecovery work is continuing following the May 3 crash of the Armenian Airbus A320 So far divers have located fewer than half of the 113 victims the vast majority of whom were Armenians The concurrent investigation into the crash is ongoing as well under the joint supervision of Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin and Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian But so far few clues have been revealed about the probable cause of the crash Without the blackbox flight recorders investigators lack critical information about the flight crews actions in the moments before the plane nosedived into the Black Sea off the Sochi coast The lack of information has angered Armenians who believe the pilot may have crashed after being told by Russian airtraffic controllers to resume preparation for landing despite poor weather conditions Georgian air officials had earlier recommended the plane turn back Armenians Suspicious Of Russias RoleWhile observers like Hovhanisian note that the responsibility for final decisions ultimately rests with the pilot and not the airtraffic controllers many Armenians  including those in the political opposition  are concerned by Russias role in the crash They have also expressed doubt that an investigation led in part by Russia will be fully honest   A portrait of Vagan Abramyants hanging in the Moscow metro Abramyants was murdered at the station on April 24 epaRussia and Armenia have long enjoyed strong strategic ties Russia maintains a military base on Armenian soil and the two countries are partner to a landmark treaty in which Moscow has committed itself to defend Armenia militarily in the event it is attacked from outside  an apparent reference to its historic enemy Turkey It has also helped to prevent further outbreaks of violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the NagornoKarabakh enclave Armenia has also remained a loyal member of both the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS and the CIS Collective Security Treaty This is something that sets Armenia apart from its disgruntled South Caucasus neighbor Georgia which has tense relations with Moscow and has threatened to withdraw from the CIS But many Armenians remain resentful of Russia This is due in part to what is viewed as mounting racism in Russia Skinheads were believed to be behind the killing in April of a 17yearold Armenian in Moscow Energy WorriesMany Armenians also accuse Russia of seeking to monopolize the countrys energy industry Eduard Aghajanov an independent political analyst in Yerevan says Russia is not treating Armenia like an equal partnerMany already dont believe that Russia is a ally because the way Russia deals with Armenia in its

staterun gas giant Gazprom in order to prevent a threat to double gas prices Gazprom has raised naturalgas prices for nearly all of its CIS clients this year but Armenia due to its compliance saw a

second presidential terms expires in the spring of 2008  have both repeatedly said that close military cooperation with Russia is a more reliable guarantee of national security than NATO membershipPresidential ResponseBaghdasarians statement incurred a swift and negative response from Kocharian who told the independent Armenian daily Golos Armenii that Armenia is not going to join NATO and does not aspire to EU membership Noyan Tapan reported on April 27 Kocharian stressed that according to the Armenian Constitution the president determines the countrys foreign policy adding that he expects an explanation from Baghdasarian If Baghdasarian makes good on his threat to pull out of the government he risks forfeiting the post of parliament speaker together with the influence opportunities and media visibility it provides But Baghdasarian made clear on May 2 that he will pull Orinats Yerkir out of the threeparty government coalition rather than retract his statement of support for eventual NATO and EU membership At the same time he stressed that he sees NATO membership as a longterm rather than immediate goalCoalition Partners Step BackRepresentatives of the other two coalition parties immediately distanced themselves from Baghdasarians statement Galust Sahakian who heads the parliament faction of Prime Minister Andranik Markarians Republican Party of Armenia HHK told journalists that the other coalition members do not share what he termed Baghdasarians private view Noyan Tapan reported Vahan Hovannisian of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun HHD said Baghdasarian should have consulted the National Security Council of which he is a member before publicly commenting on foreign and security policy A History Of ConfrontationBaghdasarians unequivocal expression of support for NATO and EU membership was not the first issue on which he has crossed swords with the HHK Last month he voted against the report submitted by the government to parliament on the 200103 privatization program And in early 2005 he engaged in a bitter war of words with Prime Minister Markarian responding to Markarians criticism of his unilateral decision to create additional parliament committees by accusing the HHK of corruption and mismanagement Kocharian intervened on that occasion downplaying the dispute and denying that he planned to dismiss MarkarianAnd last December Baghdasarian accused unspecified local officials of stuffing ballot boxes to boost the turnout figures in the November 29 referendum on a package of draft constitutional amendmentsOther remarks by Baghdasarian in his FAZ interview may equally have been directed against Markarian Baghdasarian characterized Armenian politics as a fight between the younger generation and an older generation that is unable to break free from a Soviet mindset A directory of Armenian parliament deputies published in 1996 gave Baghdasarians date of birth as December 1965 which would make him 40 the official biography released on his appointment in June 2003 as parliament speaker said he was born in December 1968 Markarian is 54 it would not however be entirely fair to brand him as an archetypal Sovietera relic given that he joined a dissident movement in the 1960s for which he was sentenced to two years in a Soviet prison campBaghdasarian also told the FAZ that he is in favor of peaceful reforms and that all those who oppose such reforms indirectly contribute to revolutions which are not the right way to bring about change in the 21st centuryBaghdasarians statement incurred a swift and negative response from Kocharian who said Armenia is not going to join NATO and does not aspire to EU membership either Kocharian added that he expects an explanation from Baghdasarian We are fighting to ensure reforms continue and for that to happen we need free elections in Armenia he said The people who still believe that they can falsify elections must realize that those times in Armenia are past He predicted that attempts to falsify the upcoming elections as blatantly as during previous ones would lead to very great changesPreElection PositioningIt is not clear however whether Baghdasarians criticisms of the government to which his party belongs reflect a personal dislike of Markarian whether he is simply hoping to capitalize on widespread popular dissatisfaction with the present leadership or whether his expressed support for a proWestern orientation was intended primarily to identify him in the minds of Western policymakers as a possible alternative to Sarkisian in the 2008 presidential ballot Nor is it clear why he has risked defying Kocharian over the issue of NATO membership at this juncture with 12 months to go before the next electionsIf Baghdasarian makes good on his threat to pull out of the government he risks forfeiting the post of parliament speaker together with the influence opportunities and media visibility it provides Moreover doing so could split his parliament faction which currently numbers 22 deputies the opposition daily Haykakan zhamanak noted on April 14 that only seven of those deputies voted with Baghdasarian to reject the government report on privatization On May 3 the same paper reported that the Armenian opposition has expressed support for Baghdasarian and it predicted that Kocharian may retaliate by pressuring members of the OY parliament faction to defect If that hypothesis is true Baghdasarian may find himself forced into overt opposition sooner than he planned  assuming he really does intend to break with the present leadership

https://www.rferl.org/a/1068122.html,Interview Lithuanian President On Building Common Neighborhood ,"May 03, 2006 12:15 GMT",,RFERL President Adamkus the conference you are hosting  which is cosponsored by Polands President Lech Kaczynski  is officially entitled a Common Vision For A Common Neighborhood Could you briefly explain what this common vision is based onValdas Adamkus A common vision to me is the vehicle which is going to commit to us to build a Europe based on common values and linked by economic integration This is today very important within the concept of the European Union I believe we are building a new community which definitely has common goals And basically this is what we definitely need today The old democracies in Europe which were the great powers going back a couple of centuries ago are right now playing a different role And there is some competition I would say of ideas of leadershipRFERL The meeting you are hosting in Vilnius includes countries that are quite far apart geographically culturally and economically What common vision do countries as diverse and geographically distant as Lithuania and Armenia share for exampleAdamkus Lets look back into history Armenia already close to 2000 years ago was the basis for Christianity for some ideals which are so dear to Europe And today when we are talking about common values a common neighborhood we definitely should look back at history and include that which today is just as important to the European community as it was going back back backRFERL Does Lithuania now that it is a fullfledged member of NATO and the EU have a special role to play in promoting democracy to the east of the EUs borders Will you serve as an advocate for states like Georgia and Ukraine that are seeking closer ties and eventual membership in these organizationsAdamkus In a way yes because I believe that since we have already joined the European Union we believe that our neighbors should definitely enjoy the same privileges the same rights and live under the same rules as we do This is the rightful place for them to be assuming that responsibility Because lets face it Europe is one continentRFERL Europe may be one continent but ever since US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld coined the terms old Europe and new Europe there has been debate about divisions within the EU with new members like Poland and Lithuania seeming at times to be closer to America than to older EU members like France and Germany Is the EU divided or has the issue been resolvedAdamkus I wouldnt say its resolved Lets face it the old democracies in Europe which were the great powers going back a couple of centuries ago are right now playing a different role And there is some competition I would say of ideas of leadership And definitely in one sense it is very good In another sense I hope there definitely will not be a dividing line between the new countries and the old countries We are speaking about a European community we are speaking about an ideal world community believing in the same principles and ideals The experience of division of Europe especially going back to the 20th century should serve as a reminder of the tragedies of the sacrifices the European people have paid for those dividing lines which are always based on ideology  and going one step further  on autocracy and dictatorship Hopefully this is passed and we have learned the lesson  RFERL Speaking of America how do you evaluate US Vice President Dick Cheneys planned appearance at the Vilnius conference Does it send a messageAdamkus First of all it indicates one thing  that we are not just talking about the European continent which has certain values I believe we are talking globally in that respect Whatever you say the United States probably still represents the bastion of democracy which has been already in existence for more than 200 years The United States was a strong outspoken member of the world community drawing the attention of all the nations and all the people to those ideals And Cheneys presence right here shows the willingness of the United States of the people of the United States to share their experience and their values with us the new democracies RFERL Where does Russia fit in Some in Europe have expressed concern that Moscow is trying to reassert itself in countries along its border They see Russia competing for influence in Ukraine and the Caucasus against the West potentially causing new divisions in this neighborhood you are trying to unite Do you see Russia acting as a spoilerAdamkus To even consider that this is being done intentionally probably would not be representing the full truth I hope that time will show to the new generation of Russians who are maybe reluctant at the present time to accept the values to which the European Union commits itself  that they will come slowly to it And maybe I am too idealistic or naive by stating this but I hope that these kinds of meetings with different groups of people getting together will eliminate the factor you have just mentioned I mean that somebody is not playing according to the rules of fair playRFERL InterviewsA special page devoted to RFERLs interviews with newsmakers and other leading figures from across our broadcast region

determination to move ahead with its nuclear program and Americas stated determination to stop it,WASHINGTON April 26 2006 RFERL  On everyones mind in Washington lately is Irans stated determination to move ahead with its nuclear program and Americas stated determination to stop itAzerbaijan shares a nearly 300kilometer border with Iran and at the same time is an ally with the United States So the question naturally arose at todays event what role if any Baku might play in the Iran crisisAliyev said Azerbaijan has been an ally of the United States in Iraq from the very start He even joked that his government sent soldiers to join the coalition not merely drivers as Armenia did But he said he cant help Washington in any hostile action against IranWe have a bilateral agreement with Iran which clearly says that the territories of our countries cannot be used for any danger toward each other Aliyev said So its very clear and therefore our relations are regulated by international treatiesPressed On Human Rights KarabakhAnother concern in Washington is Azerbaijans record on democratic reform Human rights organizations give it a poor rating and have urged Bush to bring up the subject with Aliyev They note that in early 2005 Bush dedicated his second presidential term to spreading democracy around the worldAzerbaijan is prepared to allow ethnic Armenians to live prosperously and securely in Azerbaijan Aliyev said and all Azeris want in return is the land seized by ArmeniaAsked about his countrys efforts on democratic development Aliyev defended his record saying his people enjoyed all the freedoms of any democracyHe acknowledged that Azerbaijan is still working to improve its democratic institutionsLook at the neighborhood Aliyev said I dont think that the level of democracy in Azerbaijan is lower than in any other neighboring country There is a reality and there is a perception When you concentrate on perception  and some information not quite reflecting the reality  then you have one impression When you look at what the country is how it develops what people think then maybe you have another perceptionAliyev also was asked about his countrys continuing dispute with neighboring Armenia over the predominantly Armenian enclave of NagornoKarabakh in Azerbaijan and the large area of Azerbaijan that Armenia has occupied since their war in 1992  The NagornoKarabakh army in training last year PhotolurAzerbaijan is prepared to allow ethnic Armenians to live prosperously and securely in Azerbaijan Aliyev said just as ethnic groups do in Europe He said all Azeris want in return is the land seized by ArmeniaAliyev said the NagornoKarabakh negotiations under the mediation of the socalled Minsk Group  France Russia and the United States  at times are encouraging at times frustrating And he blamed Armenia for allowing the talks to drag onIts time for the Armenian government to begin acting more like diplomats and less like politicians Aliyev said Politicians think only about their political destiny statesmen think about the future of the nation he said I think its time for Armenias leadership to behave like statesmen to think what will happen in five years in 10 years in 15 years if the conflict will not be resolved The patience of the Azerbaijani people has limitsAn Energy NationalistAny appearance by Aliyev would be meaningless without at least one question about energy and whats become known as energy nationalism  promoting a national interest through energy policy  Europe and Asia rely increasingly on the Russian monopoly Gazprom for gas Russia made its energy influence felt in January by cutting off the gas supply to Ukraine in a disagreement over pricingThe United States and Western Europe meanwhile are promoting the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline  stretching from Azerbaijan to Turkeys southern coast  to provide an alternative to Russian gasIn the final question of Wednesdays event Aliyev was asked if he was an energy nationalist The Azeri leader laughed and said he hadnt heard the term beforeIn Azerbaijan we have energy internationalism laughter because we have all the representatives from countries  from the United States from Britain from other European countries  who work with us since 1994 in a spirit of friendship and good will Aliyev said And due to this cooperation we managed to attract about maybe 70 billion in the oil and gas sector and in total about 28 billion as investmentsLaughter aside however it remains to be seen whether Bush will ignore Azerbaijans record on human rights and democratic reform as long as it remains a reliable provider of energy to the West The NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict

https://www.rferl.org/a/1067972.html,Armenia Education Minister Challenged By PostSoviet Transition ,"April 26, 2006 14:12 GMT",,RFERL In the postSoviet period the education system in Armenia has suffered badly as everywhere in the former Soviet Union Where would you say you are today on the path to recovery Sergo Eritsian Today were in the stabilization phase One can say that after the collapse of the Soviet Union the education system was destroyed  in Armenia as elsewhere Stabilization means more than just the restoration of what existed before Were reviving the system and carrying through reforms at the same time Revival means that reforms are under way on the basis of the national educational system Its parameters are closer to the international system RFERL I want to speak precisely about that What are your aims in the reform of the education system What values do you wish to inculcate in your students and how in your opinion should these values reflect the sort of society you are trying to create in Armenia Eritsian First of all the quality of education Meaning that when students have received their education they are able to compete on the market Naturally when a student becomes a specialist when he has received a higher education  and if lets say an economist or a lawyer is unable to compete in any European country that means the profession he has acquired in Armenia is not up to scratch Its very important that we prepare internationalstandard specialists But the most important thing is for our specialists to be able to be specialists in our country because the process of reviving the economy in different spheres of life requires a particular approach on the part of the specialists we are preparing That is to say he needs to be not just a specialist who measures up to the highest international standards but also someone who is thinking about how to revive the country What is his philosophical approach what is his professional approach and how does he think about his country As I said our national system of education is based on national criteria but it is at the same time international RFERL Corruption is a big problem everywhere in the former Soviet Union How are you coping with this problem in Armenia  in your ministry and in the education system as a whole And I mean not just the problem of how to deal with corrupt officials but also corruption as a moral issue in society Eritsian Corruption is a moral question of course and we have to find the mechanism that will allow us to fight against it Take the case of entrance exams perhaps we should introduce a unified examination system  which is what we are doing  introduce the unified exam system which is already welltested in Western countries and is even being tested now in Russia and other CIS countries notably our neighbor Georgia Of course this is a moral problem for every country and secondly we have to create the necessary mechanism to prevent dishonest officials from using the opportunities presented by their positions But the main struggle is at the level of society so that society should say no to corruption and we  officials ministers and specialists working in education  must also say noRFERL To what extent in Armenia  and I refer of course to the education system  are you encouraging diversity of views among the new generationEritsian You know I think we have more freedom of opinion than is necessary for a system in a transitional period Our institutes of higher education are independent as are all kinds of student organizations So honestly speaking I can say there is no problem in this area Problems sometimes occur when we have to conduct dialogue with the students every day about various problems of education and the colleges But we have to be frank with the student body and we have to resolve all problems  however difficult they might be  through dialogue Sometimes this creates problems Last year for instance the students were against the introduction of the system of credits in education But then we organized seminars and meetings to explain things and they understood that it was in their interests Of course people had become used to working in the old way For them it was very easy to work in the old way and receive higher pay but when the system is being reformed the following picture emerges people dont want to do anything they dont want to undergo retraining they dont want to use the Internet they dont want to make use of virtual laboratories and dont want to use electronic books But to them we say Dear teacher its time to work in a different wayBut this doesnt happen very often because they know there are plenty of other people who are ready to take their jobs The development of any country demands reform of the education system otherwise you cant move forward This is particularly true of small countries like Armenia Armenia was is and will be a country where education and educated people will be valuedRFERL Its one thing to introduce a new system of education but quite another to find the staff to make it work Where do you find them Eritsian This is the most difficult issue Its really difficult to find the personnel for the ministry to put together a team of reformers There are people of course and were training new staff at the Institute of Education Youve raised a really critical issue Yes sometimes reforms dont go as well as they should or theyre ineffective because we dont have the people to carry them out This year alone onethird of our teachers will undergo retraining but sometimes reforms in many areas dont go as we would like Sometimes we dont have enough staff in schools who can work with new technology In remote villages its difficult to find teachers who can use a computer and the Internet never mind use them to teach chemistry or biology or other subjects But the desire is there RFERL The teaching of history is a very sensitive issue in a region where national stereotyping has often been an obstacle to reconciliation and mutual understanding What can you do to encourage Armenian students to develop a less onedimensional view of their neighbors Eritsian As you know there is an attempt to create a textbook on the history of the Caucasian peoples with the help of the Council of Europe This book exists in unpublished form But there are of course fine points of history that sometimes make it impossible for different sides to understand one another Take the case of the Armenian genocide The problem as regards our neighbors is that they dont want to use the word genocide in the book Or they want to qualify it by saying it reflects the Armenian position You know we have to be loyal to history If in a neighboring country they havent yet accepted the fact of the genocide in 1915 thats another matter RFERL Were not talking just about genocide hereEritsian You understand in our country nowincidentally the reason the book is not going ahead is only because of this one issue on which we havent yet been able to agree On all other matters weve reached agreement Nevertheless this is very important for the Armenian people and the peoples of the South Caucasus They need to know about it For this reason from the Armenian point of view there is great insistence on the resolution of such matters Of course our neighbors dont always respond in an adequate fashion But I think that through various dialogues we can find the sort of book that will be acceptable for all the South Caucasus states Thats the first thing But as far as I understood it your question also implies the following I think every people writes its own history RFERL Thats an interesting formulation Every people writes its own history In fact its not really like that There exist various different ways of approaching the problems of history For instance there exists many different versions of the history of Scotland Eritsian But you understand even if just from the point of view of information there must be a history textbook that tells things as they were We dont want our textbooks to tell something different We want the basic information for our young generation about what happened About what happened lets say in 1915 or in the 1920s or in the Soviet period or 500 years ago We want information without commentary Let each child supply his or her own commentary After school its another matter but children must know some facts In this respect I think our approach is very constructive and we will continue consultations and meetings with our colleagues from the other Caucasus states until we find common language on the history textbook Were neighbors you understand we have to live together The situation demands that we understand each other from the point of view of historical truth Then well have textbooks with faithful approaches perhaps most of all with civilized approaches RFERL One could say that faithful histories in the context of the South Caucasus are at the heart of the regions problemsEritsian Im talking about just histories But sometimes in transitional periods you need faithful approaches to history you know when some sentence or other could hinder mutual understanding Maybe its better to formulate that sentence in such a context that I can understand it and my neighbor can understand it and my other neighbor too But the main thing is that all our approaches be historically fair Its difficult to live without truth although for many many centuries people have been distorting the truth or telling only part of the truth The main thing for us is historical truth and todays reality First of all we must trust each otherRFERL If we could be specific Do there exist any official Armenian textbooks that discuss the historical or cultural achievements of Turkey or Azerbaijan or Georgia Thats to say in a positive lightEritsian Well theres the Council of Europe textbook which includes contributions from representatives of three countries if I am not mistaken Georgia Azerbaijan and Armenia They have worked on it for a long time and I think the book searches for historical truth If all sides can agree on it this will be something historically positive Those historical facts that reflect some sort of crossroads or interconnections and which the sides did not want covered in this book are not there Theyve been left for the future Future specialists can include these facts in a more convincing way in the textbook For the moment weve only included what is acceptable to allRFERL If I can put the question slightly differently Do you regard such textbooks as necessaryEritsian I think they are I want dialogue I dont want a situation in which in Armenian schools in Georgia they dont study Armenian history or geography I dont want them just to study the Armenian language I want that in those schools where there are Armenians  like all of Javakheti in southern Georgia  that they study Armenian history and geography We dont have that yet but dialogue will help us to understand each other better in these schools Georgians should know more about the history of Armenia Armenians should know about the history of Azerbaijan and Georgia so that we know each other better Then there will be more trust and mutual enrichment well develop more horizontal links and so on As minister of education and science I support full cooperation between the three states of the South Caucasus Two years ago in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe I said I was ready to participate in any program in which our neighboring country is participating It would be good if we neighbors quickly find common language with each other but the situation being what it is I think we should thank the Council of Europe for creating the conditions in which we can perhaps write books and other things for the sake of development and goodneighborly relations and for a region in

agreement on at least one of the frozen conflicts of the former Soviet Union may be within reach ,PRAGUE April 21 2006 RFERL  A flurry of diplomatic activity has reawakened hopes that an agreement on at least one of the frozen conflicts of the former Soviet Union may be within reach  Part of the optimism stems from growing international attention to the problems of the postSoviet states  The decision of the United States to press for the inclusion of the frozen conflicts in NagornoKarabakh Abkhazia South Ossetia and Transdniester on the St Petersburg G8 summit agenda is a case in pointArmenias foreign minister said that if Azerbaijan accepts the right of the people of NagornoKarabakh to selfdetermination to be exercised at some time in the future Armenia is prepared to move on other issues International politics appears to be shifting and energy seems to be at the heart of the matter  energy combined with the increasingly robust foreign policies of Russia and Iran  As a major oil and gas exporter and a neighbor of Iran Azerbaijan increasingly finds itself the focus of US attention With USIranian relations continuing to worsen few doubt that Iran and the possibility of sanctions will be on the agenda when Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev meets with US President George Bush in Washington on April 28 Azerbaijans Position But Aliyev may feel emboldened to ask for more in return Brenda Shaffer who is head of the Caspian Studies Department at the University of Harvard thinks this is a good moment for Azerbaijan to link wider international concerns to the problem of NagornoKarabakh  If there will be any sanctions regime on Iran and its very clear that in any economic sanctions it will be very important the border with Azerbaijan sic Shaffer said Clearly this will be on the agenda between Bush and President Aliyev and this will be the place for President Aliyev to say OK were cooperating on international issues in such a way we need international cooperation and fulfillment on NagornoKarabakh I think there will be a good chance to make progress through this meeting  This comes at a time too of growing fluidity in talks between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians As Steven Mann Washingtons chief Karabakh negotiator left Yerevan and traveled on to Baku Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that if Azerbaijan accepts the right of the people of NagornoKarabakh to selfdetermination to be exercised at some time in the future Armenia is prepared to move on such issues as Azerbaijani territories outside Karabakh occupied by Armenia the return of refugees and security guarantees  That provoked an unusually rapid and positive response from Azerbaijan Oskanians comments it said were constructive and demonstrated a commitment to actively take part in peace talks on the resolution of the ArmenianAzerbaijani conflict A Topic For The G8 Agenda Shaffer believes the US call to include the frozen conflicts on the agenda of the G8 summit strengthens Bakus hand even more  The idea that this will on the table during the G8 meetings in St Petersburg in July is an incredible opportunity for Azerbaijan and probably the Azerbaijani leadership is focusing on how with all these geopolitical changes taking place how to keep NagornoKarabakh on the international agenda and how to use these geopolitical changes in order to benefit the Azerbaijani stance on the NagornoKarabakh conflict Shaffer said  The OSCE which is mediating the peace talks will also want to exploit the new fluidity in international politics Ideally it would like another summit to follow the disappointing meeting between Aliyev and Kocharian in February But Yuriy Merzlyakov who is Moscows OSCE negotiator is calling for patience  I think it would be premature to talk of an agreement Merzlyakov said We need to talk first to the ministers and we need to visit the region again I think it would be desirable to wait until midMay As a major oil and gas exporter and a neighbor of Iran Azerbaijan increasingly finds itself the focus of US attention   But it is not just NagornoKarabakh where there is sign of movement  The European Union  which until recently has seemed too focused on its problems in the Balkans to contemplate the challenges of the Southern Caucasus and Moldova  may be changing its position The German paper Der Welt writes today that Chancellor Angela Merkel is planning to use a speech to the European Union parliament in early May to urge the development of a new eastern policy for Europe which would put the Caucasus at the center of its focus  And it may not be alone Washington too appears to be taking greater interest  prompted perhaps by the need to protect its energy interests in the southern Caucasus and Russias

https://www.rferl.org/a/1067662.html,Caucasus Frozen Conflicts Still Freezing Issue Of Missing People ,"April 14, 2006 09:22 GMT",,PRAGUE April 14 2006 RFERL  Ethnic conflicts in the 1990s claimed tens of thousands of lives in the South Caucasus Some 15 years later many families are still searching for information about relatives who disappeared without a trace in the fighting Groups like the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC are part of efforts to ascertain the fate of people who went missing in NagornoKarabakh Abkhazia and South Ossetia And this was one of the key issues on the agenda of the ICRCs president Jakob Kellenberger when he toured the South Caucasus between April 3 and April 9 to meet with the presidents and other senior officials of Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia to discuss humanitarian issues related to the regions socalled frozen conflicts Isabelle Barras the ICRCs head of operations for Eastern Europe and a member of the ICRC delegation spoke on her return to RFERL RFERL How many people are still unaccounted for from the conflict in NagornoKarabakh where a fragile ceasefire has been in place since 1994 Fourteen years after the start of the conflict and 12 years after the signing of the ceasefire in this region we are still opening casesIsabelle Barras The figures are evolving actually It might sound a bit strange but 14 years after the start of the conflict and 12 years after the signing of the ceasefire in this region we are still opening cases There are still families approaching the ICRC with old cases of people who have gone missing And the figures that the authorities have and that the ICRC has collected directly from the families are not always the same So far as far as the ICRC is concerned in relation with the NagornoKarabakh conflict we have 3750 total cases of people who have gone missing That means Armenians Azerbaijanis and people from NagornoKarabakh although the majority of them are Azerbaijanis Those are the current figures But again we are opening new cases almost every day RFERL In addition to tracking data related to individual cases of missing persons what other work is the ICRC doing on this issueBarras There is also some work that can be done with the families some psychological support that can be offered Unfortunately in such matters we have to work on the basis of the fact that most of the cases are people who have died We know that one of the solutions might be that it will at some point be possible to proceed with exhumations And then there will be all the identifications This means that you have to get as much information as possible to make a link between human remains and a person in one of those cases And thats a process that is going to start in the three countries It has been done already partly in Georgia and it will start in Azerbaijan and then in Armenia  to collect that information and keep it and record it properly so that at the moment of exhumation it will be useful for identification   The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross Jakob Kellenberger at a treatment center for prisoners with tuberculosis in Azerbaijan courtesy of the ICRCRFERL There is also the issue of prisoners of war POWs and of soldiers and civilians detained for crossing the AzerbaijaniArmenian border or violating the line of contact with NagornoKarabakh Is the ICRC involved in securing the release of such POWs And how many such cases are there Barras This is of course something that we have been doing for quite a long time We do not have a population of prisoners of war we have been visiting for a long time because usually they repatriate people quite quickly And the ICRC is acting there as a neutral intermediary between both sides and so has to organize the repatriation of the person after of course having confirmed that he is willing to go back to his place of origin Since the very beginning of this kind of activity we have been involved in 656 such repatriations Its not always a prisoner of war of course  sometimes its a civilian person This does happen also that a civilian crosses the border  sometimes by mistake simply RFERL Kellenbergers trip also focused on Georgias separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia What kinds of issues does the ICRC deal with there Barras The issue of missing persons is also one of the most important cases being followed by the ICRC in Georgia The number of cases is a bit lower than in Armenia and Azerbaijan Were speaking about around 2000 persons who have gone missing This is in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia but the biggest number is concerning Abkhazia RFERL There is also the issue of the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the fighting between Georgian and separatist troops in 199293 Does the ICRC also work with issues of internally displaced people IDPsBarras We know there are discussions about the possible return of IDPs more particularly in the region of Gali between Abkhazia and western Georgia This is something that we follow in terms of whether there is the possibility or necessity for us to be involved If at one point this repatriation is organized we would probably be ready to do something But we are not part of the discussions about those returns I know that it is more discussed with the United Nations system and we follow that But the ICRC is not directly part of those talks RFERL In the case of Abkhazia communication between the two sides is said to be virtually nonexistent The situation is hardly better in terms of Armenia and Azerbaijan in dealing with NagornoKarabakh Is it possible for the ICRC to do its work in situation where there are few if any official negotiations on such politically delicate issuesBarras I think its important to understand that in relation to such a sensitive case its very rare that we can make significant progress in the absence of a peaceful resolution of the conflict As you know all the conflicts in this region are unsolved  they are still ongoing even if theyre no longer in the acute phase We are in situations that have not been solved politically And this is definitely very difficult in the absence of a peace settlement to have concrete progress But nevertheless there are a lot of things that can be done in order to prepare the ground for when there will be a possibility to go ahead with a more concrete solution RFERL Russia has a significant influence in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia something that has angered officials in Tbilisi and decreased the likelihood of a settlement anytime soon Does the ICRC deal with Russia when it comes to its work in those two separatist regions Barras Our main discussions on what we are doing in Abkhazia and South Ossetia would definitely be with the Georgian government

Foreign Ministry reminded Yerevan and Baku that they must find a mutually acceptable solution to their 18year dispute over NagornoKarabakh,PRAGUE April 6 2006 RFERL  On the eve of the Oskanians visit the Russian Foreign Ministry reminded Yerevan and Baku that they must find a mutually acceptable solution to their 18year dispute over NagornoKarabakh In comments made on April 4 Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said Moscow favors the continuation of ArmenianAzerbaijani dialogue first of all between both countries presidents Face To Face Robert Kocharian of Armenia and Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan last met in February in Rambouillet near Paris  Their meeting was initially viewed as a positive step by France the United States and Russia  the cochairs of the Minsk Group of nations that mediates in the conflict on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe But although the summit extended over two days the talks lasted just over six hours and ended inconclusively And statements made by the Azerbaijani president in the wake of the headtohead meeting have fuelled speculation that the negotiation process reached a new stalemate International mediators insist the failure of the Rambouillet summit does not mean that the peace process is at a deadlock  Addressing an Azeri world congress in Baku on March 16 Aliyev threatened to withdraw from the peace talks unless  as he put it  Armenia stops dragging its feet We have been holding peace talks for the last 12 years Aliyev said For 12 years weve had a ceasefire regime and held talks with the hope that they would bear fruit But how long is it going to last This process cannot last forever The patience of the Azerbaijani people and of the Azerbaijani government is running out  Bold Statements Aliyev also told the congress that Azerbaijans annual defense spending which currently stands at 600 million would continue to increase until it matches Armenias entire state budget  Aliyev and his late father who rules postSoviet Azerbaijan for a decade have made such statements in the past threatening to forcibly recapture all territories that have been occupied by ethnic Armenian forces since 1993 if diplomacy fails International mediators insist the failure of the Rambouillet summit does not mean that the peace process is at a deadlock However as Russian Minsk Group cochairman Yury Merzlyakov says the clock is ticking for the sides to strike a compromise It is pretty unusual that the peace process should not be influenced by elections A new election cycle is expected to start in 2007 and it will last approximately three years Merzlyakov said In other words there will be elections in one or the other country during that period We know by experience that any election slows down the peace process as it happened in 2003 when there were presidential polls in Azerbaijan Sometimes it even brings it to a halt for quite some time Serious Consequences In comments made to RFERLs Azerbaijani Service in the wake of the Rambouillet summit Merzlyakovs US counterpart was even more candid According to Steven Mann failure to reach an agreement this year would have most serious consequences There has been so much positive work that has been done in the past two years Mann said The window is right and necessary to reach an agreement So it will be a true tragedy if the sides do not take advantage of this opportunity   French President Jacques Chirac right greets Armenian President Robert Kocharian at the Elysee Palace in Paris January 2006 epaThe inconclusiveness of the Rambouillet talks has triggered renewed Karabakhrelated diplomatic activity  The Minsk Group cochairs met twice last month  in Washington and in Istanbul  to assess the outcome of the summit Both Oskanian and Azerbaijans Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov held separate consultations with US officials in Washington  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov is expected in the US capital within days for talks that could pave the way for Aliyevs visit later this month Room For Success  Yet Merzlyakov makes it clear no breakthrough is possible without the two presidents being personally involved Everything depends on both objective reasons and subjective factors Merzlyakov said It looks like all objective conditions for a breakthrough are here But we have to take into account the subjective aspects of the issue which are the political will of both parties and their readiness to prepare their public opinions with a view to solving this conflict peacefully With this respect there is still a lot or work to be done In the Russian ambassadors words the best way to give the peace process a new impetus would be for the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents to meet face to face again But he says this prospect looks rather slim at the moment We must now find opportunities to revive the process including through contacts between the cochairs and the presidents and through new meetings  rather a new meeting  between the two presidents so that they could continue discussing Merzlyakov said But were now in a rather delicate phase and we havent even started discussing that possibility Its even difficult to talk to the parties about that because there is no international meeting scheduled in the near future that both two presidents could attend As for the prospect of Kocharian and Aliyev holding a new summit the Russian envoy makes it clear international mediators would rather concentrate their efforts on keeping the peace process alive through shuttle diplomacy and separate talks with the presidents  After Rambouillet perhaps we should reverse to the old system Merzlyakov said  RFERLs Azerbaijani Service correspondent Kenan

the government of each country to take steps with their publics to prepare them for peace and not for war The cochairs next meeting is scheduled for March 20 in IstanbulThe Minsk group which consists of 13 OSCE countries has provided a forum for negotiations to settle the conflict over NagornoKarabakh since 1992 Its important that an agreement be reached this year because if not the fear is that the window of opportunity will be closed because domestic politics will then take over in both countries in the lead up to election periods in 2007 and 2008 As part of that effort the cochairs of the group  France Russia and the United States  held two days of meetings in Washington this week to press for a new meeting between the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidentsIn the runup to this weeks sessions the US cochair expressed optimism that progress could be madeUS Ambassador Steven Mann said this year could bring a breakthrough in the impasse over NagornoKarabakh because neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan are holding an election in 2006 A Window Of Opportunity ClosingBut some other observers were less hopefulCory Welt deputy director of the Russian and Eurasian Program at the Washingtonbased Center for Strategic and International Studies told RFERL that Ambassador Manns emphasis on achieving an agreement this year stems more from desperation than optimism  Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev met in a Paris suburb for talks in February 2006 AFPHes trying to emphasize that its important that an agreement be reached this year because if not the fear is that the window of opportunity will be closed because domestic politics will then take over in both countries in the lead up to election periods in 2007 and 2008 Welt said So what theyre trying to do is in a sense put pressure on the parties almost to convince them that now is the time to reach an agreement If they do not it is unlikely they will be able to get their houses in order and they will be unlikely to really be able to get full outside supportWelt suggests that it might be wiser to keep expectations from this weeks meeting low Its a troubling road to take when you put that kind of pressure and that many expectations on a process within one year Its going to be a tough battle and if they dont accomplish what they set out to accomplish this year then there is a danger of a selffulfilling prophecy making further efforts at reconciliation impossiblePolitical Will Needed For SettlementThe Minsk Group talks follow an exchange of heated words between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev Aliyev said on March 1 that talks with Armenia were at a dead end and called for freeing NagornoKarabakh no matter what it takes The next day Kocharian declared that if Azerbaijan drops out of further negotiations then Armenia will formally recognize NagornoKarabakh Liz Fuller RFERL Caucasus analyst suggests that Aliyevs words were nothing new but said some of the realities on the ground may have changedThere is also the question of whether the Azerbaijani Armed Forces have improved over the past decade to the point that they could defeat the Armenian army Armenias Defense Minister Serge Sarkisyan said that he considers Azerbaijani statements as being more in the realm of pressure or blackmail than a real threat And he made the point that if you are going to launch a surprise attack on your adversary then you dont go round beforehand saying that were going to do itFuller suggests that the failure of the Rambouillet talks to produce an agreement represents a minor setback not a major disaster She characterizes the Minsk process overall as a positive one which almost produced a peace agreement in 2001 The current progress dates back just about two years to when Elmar Mammadyarov replaced Vilayet Guliev as Azerbaijani foreign minister and the two foreign ministers began meeting regularly first in Prague and then in other European capitals Fuller explained And its primarily thanks to them with some input from the three cochairmen that they have gradually reached agreement on the seven out of nine basic points that would form the sort of skeleton of a future formal peace agreementGiven the political will Fuller suggests that it might still be possible to reach agreement on the basic points

https://www.rferl.org/a/1066387.html,CIS The Hard Road Away From Presidential Rule ,"March 06, 2006 10:21 GMT",,Yet whatever the official justification for these democratic reforms basically they reflected bitter power struggles among political elites In all three cases the bulk of the bargaining was conducted behind the scenes with little or no effort made to explain the essence of such important constitutional changes to the public The Armenian opposition launched a vocal campaign urging voters to boycott the November 2005 referendum on constitutional changes arguing that the amendments did not do enough to curb the presidents powers and they subsequently rejected as rigged official claims of 65 percent turnout with 93 percent of participants endorsing the proposed changes President Robert Kocharians opponents fear that he plans to use the reform to remain at the peak of Armenian politics beyond 2008 when his second presidential term expires by assuming the post of prime minister It is speculated that Russian President Vladimir Putin too may favor a transition to parliamentary rule in order to remain in power as the head of the cabinet after his second presidential term ends in 2008 The Moldova ModelThese constitutional changes determine the official rules of the political game and therefore are vital to mitigating conflicts among ruling elites To that end the implementation of the new rules counts more than the debates surrounding their design With a parliamentary republic in place since March 2001 Moldova offers an indication of how things might develop in Armenia and Ukraine The Moldovan parliament approved a reform bill by an overwhelming majority 98 votes to 2 in July 2000 The reform aimed at dampening the political aspirations of then President Petru Lucinschi to introduce a superpresidentialist system along the model established in Russia by Boris Yeltsin According to Lucinschi such magnified presidential powers were a necessary precondition for successfully carrying out enduring economic reformsBy contrast his most vocal opponents including Party of Moldovan Communists PCM leader Vladimir Voronin insisted parliamentary rule would distinguish Moldova from the authoritarian regimes of Central Asian and set it on a solid path toward Europeanstyle democracy In addition the proposed reform abolished direct presidential elections thus significantly reducing the legitimacy of future heads of state Communists Call The ShotsBut following a landslide victory in the February 2001 parliamentary elections it was PCM chief Voronin who obtained the leverage to interpret and implement the constitutional reform Voronin could have chosen either of the two most influential positions under the parliamentary republic  parliamentary speaker or prime minister Instead he preferred to serve as president albeit with a much more powerful mandate than his constitutionally reserved ceremonial role Given the popular prestige of the presidency and a lingering Soviet legacy for strong executives Voronins choice was not unexpected In addition he managed to retain his position as PCM chairman by skillfully exploiting a gap in the reform design namely the absence of a clear constitutional ban on the president simultaneously holding two positions A proposal floated by PCM officials in the summer of 2001 to have Voronin take over the premiership on top of his presidential function never saw the light of the day In fact the dual executive system was established to use the cabinet as a scapegoat for potential policy failures The issue of a politicized presidency rose to the top of the countrys political agenda in the wake of the parliamentary elections of March 6 2005 when in exchange for voting in favor of Voronins reelection as president several political parties agreed one month later to depoliticize the position of the head of state Also the PCM pledged to abandon its communist orthodoxy and join the mainstream of modern European leftist parties Broken PromisesWith a communistmajority government and a multiparty presidential coalition Moldovas parliamentary republic continues to function as it did during the communists first term in power 200105 And almost a year after the assurances given to the opposition Voronin is still PCM chairman Nor are there any signs that the partys name will be changed in the near future Voronin intends to control both the process of modernizing the PCM and the timing of his resignation as party chairman in order not to jeopardize the Communists success at the ballot box in the local and parliamentary elections due in 2007 and 2009 respectivelyBut while reform of the PCM might well be an internal party affair the depolitization of the presidency is not It deals with the constitutional rules of the political game and affects both the government and opposition players alike In November 2005 the leaders of the Democratic Party PD and Social Liberal Party PSL Dumitru Diakov and Oleg Serebrian who backed Voronins reelection publicly accused the president of reneging on his promise to step down as party chief The PSL leader went even further calling for the presidents impeachmentAlthough the PSL lacks the institutional means to carry out this initiative the votes of twothirds out of the countrys 101 lawmakers are required to impeach the president while there are currently only 11 PSL and PD deputies it is an important symbolic move from the socalled constructivist opposition These developments show that depoliticizing the presidency could become the most explosive political issue of the communists second term in power Of course only a constitutional amendment could bridge this legal gap Even if such a proposal is not currently on the table Voronins official relinquishing of his chairmanship post might strengthen rather than weaken the PCM The Moldovan president could follow the example of his Romanian counterpart Traian Basescu Although Basescu gave up the leadership of the Democratic Party PD after winning a presidential election in December 2004 he remains an influential behindthescenes actor in PD affairs In addition an unofficial role for Voronin would conform perfectly to the Byzantine character of presentday Moldovan politics In addition by abandoning the post of PCM chairman Voronin would deprive critics from within the sultanistic regime of Transdniester separatist leader Igor Smirnov of any pretext to accuse him of authoritarianism A consolidated democracy is not only a precondition for the reunification of the country with its rebellious Transdniester region but also for Moldovas efforts to integrate into the European UnionLooking Toward UkraineAlthough a similar reform has been in effect for two months in Ukraine its effects remain inconclusive The current standoff between the Verkhovna Rada and President Viktor Yushchenko will subside after next months parliamentary elections only if the president manages to reassemble a strong Orange coalition capable of winning a majority Despite the procedural irregularities associated with deciding the reforms design before the critical third round of voting in December 2004 Ukrainian democracy would be better served if it is implemented without significant revision That would make the Ukrainian political process more transparent and help make the democratic aspirations of millions of Ukrainians who unequivocally supported Yushchenko during the Orange Revolution a realityIt is clear from the Moldovan experience that the transition to parliamentary rule is a very complicated political process Because the rules of the political game remain fluid politicians tailor them to promote partisan agendas meaning that democratic advancement is often sacrificed for political stability However curtailing the power of a strong executive is a decisive step in the right direction Had this process been launched after the first wave of reforms in the mid1990s some CIS countries including Moldova would be further down the path of democratic consolidation todayThe Governments View Armenian President Robert Kocharian file

President Robert Kocharian hinted that he was prepared to recognize the disputed republic of NagornoKarabakh,PRAGUE March 3 2006 RFERL  In an television interview on March 2 Armenian President Robert Kocharian hinted that he was prepared to recognize the disputed republic of NagornoKarabakhBut he said that would only happen if Azerbaijan opts out of further negotiations or launches a new military offensive But if the moment arrives when Azerbaijan indeed unequivocally says that the time is right for them that they have to strengthen their army and in the future will solve the Karabakh issue by force then our steps should be as followed firstly de jure recognition of NagornoKarabkah by the Republic of ArmeniaIn the interview which was carried by three national television channels Kocharian added that further steps could be taken in strengthening the Armenianoccupied military zone around Karabakh and deeper integration with the Karabakh republic in the security sphere Successive Armenian leaderships have traditionally shied away from recognizing Karabakh and have said that Yerevan will not be the first to do soThreeWay TalksKocharian also said that he believes that the Karabakh leadership should be involved in peace negotiations We have to try to engage NagornoKarabakh more actively in the negotiation process Of course the best option would have been if the president of Azerbaijan president of NagornoKarabakh and the president of Armenia sat down around the negotiating table and if NagornoKarabakh would be represented by legitimate authoritiesThe inclusion of the Karabakh leadership in the peace talks has long been a source of contention Speaking to RFERLs Armenian Service on February 18 Arkady Ghukasian the president of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh republic said that in the event that no progress is made in the peace talks the Karabakh leadership might seek to pressure Armenia to recognize the republic as an independent state President Kocharians comments on March 2 come one day after strong words from his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev Speaking in the town of Banofshala a small part of NagornoKarabakh still controlled by Azerbaijan Aliyev said that talks with Armenia over NagornoKarabakh are at a dead end He also said that NagornoKarabakh is Azerbaijani land and We must free NagornoKarabakh no matter what it takesThe Azerbaijani president was in the region visiting camps for Azerbaijani displaced persons who fled their homes during the Karabakh war According to RFERL Caucasus analyst Liz Fuller both Aliyev and Defense Minister Safar Abiyev have repeatedly hinted in the past that Azerbaijan might resort to a new war to bring Karabakh back under its control But Fuller said that Aliyevs recent comments may have been intended as much as a gesture of solidarity with the displaced persons as a statement of intent to go to warArmenian forces control most of Karabakh and some of its surrounding areas The enclaves status remains unresolved since the three sides  Armenia Azerbaijan and the unrecognized NagornoKarabkah Republic  ended three years of fighting and signed a Russianbrokered ceasefire in May 1994 During the fighting about 600000 Azeris were displaced and as many as 25000 people were killed Others put the number of displaced persons as much higherParis MeetingIn the runup to the February summit in Rambouillet diplomats had expressed guarded optimism that progress would be likely during the talks Kocharian and Aliyev met facetoface on February 1011 But the talks were widely touted as a disappointment In a statement issued at the end of the summit the cochairs of the Minsk Group of nations  mandated by the OSCE to mediate a solution to the conflict since 1992  said the discussions were intensive but provided no breakthroughThe American cochair of the group Ambassador Steven Mann talked to RFERLs Armenian and Azerbaijani Services after the summit The full range of issues were discussed There were I think good personal atmospherics between the two presidents and the discussions did not result in a substantial change of the positions that the parties have held for monthsSome observers are concerned about the military buildup in both countries  and its potential impact on the peace process Both sides have increased defense spending in 2006 The Minsk Group of Russian French and US mediators is set to meet in Washington in early March to formulate the framework of future negotiationsThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the

today confident that relations with Azerbaijan have shown signs of picking up ,PRAGUE 21 February 2006 RFERL  Vladimir Putin flies into Azerbaijan today confident that relations with Azerbaijan have shown signs of picking up Trade has never been so good topping 1 billion last year for the first time He will be hopeful too of finding common ground with President Ilham Aliyev who was stung by Western criticism of the conduct of the November 2005 parliamentary elections Putin however congratulated Aliyev on the outcomeThis optimism is all in marked contrast to Moscows approach to Georgia which the Kremlin and the Russian media continue to depict as incorrigibly proWestern and aggressively antiRussianThat on one level appears somewhat contradictory Azerbaijan has been at least as proWestern as Georgia in the last decade and has certainly done more than Georgia to break Moscows geostrategic grip on the region The BakuTbilisiCeyhan oil pipeline built with US backing and soon to be followed by the BakuTbilisiErzerum gas pipeline has vastly increased the economic independence of both Azerbaijan and GeorgiaWiser With ExperienceHow then to explain the rather more subtle approach of Russian diplomacy to Azerbaijan Aleksandre Rondeli of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies believes Moscow may have learnt lessons from its Georgian experienceAzerbaijan still sees Russia as Armenias ally in the dispute over the region of NagornoKarabakhSuch were the methods used by Russia against Georgia that right from the beginning they backed themselves into a corner Rondeli says In fact they used military methods force and blackmail And as a consequence they find they have no flexibility of action And the main result is that they now have this hard relentless opposition in the form of President Mikheil Saakashvili and his team In other words the Kremlin has learnt from its Georgian mistake and is adopting a less hostile approach in its dealings with Azerbaijan Thats certainly one explanation Vafa Guluzade has another Guluzade was foreignpolicy adviser to Heydar Aliyev the late president of Azerbaijan and father of Ilham Aliyev and remains a close observer of Moscows relations with the South Caucasus statesGeorgia is much more independent from Russia than Azerbaijan because Georgia is saying the truth to Russias face but we are not saying it Guluzade says We Azerbaijan are not saying to Russia that you are occupying our territory get out from our territory it is not Armenia Georgia is fighting for its rights We are not fighting for our rights Thats why Russia is very happy with us Seeing Through The Lens Of The PastIts an explanation that suggests too the restrictions on any hope for improvement in Moscows relations with Baku The apparently insurmountable obstacle remains that Azerbaijan still sees Russia as Armenias ally in the dispute over the region of NagornoKarabakh  Azerbaijani soldiers in NagornoKarabakh in 1992 AFPWhen Guluzade says Russia is occupying Azerbaijani territory what he means is that like many Azerbaijanis he sees Armenia as a proxy of Russia in the region  and Armenia is still occupying seven Azerbaijani regions surrounding Karabakh So for all the improvements in trade relations Guluzade says Azerbaijan should remain wary of Russia Russia is able to offer Azerbaijan nothing because Russia doesnt want Azerbaijan to be strong to be independent and to escape from occupation of its territory he adds Russia is able to propose some support maybe in the liberation of one or two regions but the price is very big it is the independence of Azerbaijan Which suggests that despite the growing refinement of Moscows diplomacy towards Baku its foreign policy in Azerbaijan as in Georgia remains the prisoner of decisions and policies adopted in the 1990s following the breakup of the Soviet Union Rightly or wrongly Azerbaijanis like Georgians see Russia as a former colonial power that has not yet abandoned its colonial instincts Putin would like Azerbaijan to accept Russian troops as peacekeepers in and around Karabakh in the event of a peace deal with Armenia Hes not likely to get much encouragement for that in Baku Suspicions of Russias support for Armenia aside Azerbaijan will not want to repeat the Georgian experience in its breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia where Georgia accuses Russian peacekeepers of supporting the Abkhaz and Ossetians And despite all the improvements in Russias trade with Azerbaijan Aliyev will not want to do anything to undermine his burgeoning relationship with the West Oil and gas are the twin props of Azerbaijani independence and they need Western marketsThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of

https://www.rferl.org/a/1066008.html,ArmeniaAzerbaijan Karabakh Wants To Be In On Settlement Talks ,"February 21, 2006 15:50 GMT",,Ghukasian construed Azerbaijans rejection of such direct talks as reflecting a lack of interest in reaching a negotiated solutionThe negotiating process that was going on within the Minsk Group framework is nonexistent today he told RFRRL We can find a way out of this situation only in a real negotiating format involving NagornoKarabakh When Azerbaijan talks only to Armenia without NagornoKarabakh Azerbaijan engages only in propaganda Once Azerbaijan starts talking to Karabakh for me it will be a signal that Azerbaijan is looking for a solution to the issue NagornoKarabakh a region within Azerbaijan is predominantly ethnic Armenian Following the unilateral 1991 declaration of NagornoKarabakhs independence from Azerbaijan hitherto sporadic fighting escalated into a fullfledged war in which Armenian forces took control of swathes of neighboring Azerbaijani territory The three sides  Armenia Azerbaijan and the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic  signed a ceasefire agreement in May 1994 The Minsk Group was created in 1992 to mediate a solution to the conflict and NagornoKarabakh representatives regularly participated in talks with Armenia and Azerbaijan under its aegis until 1996 But following the appointment of then NKR President Robert Kocharian as Armenian Prime Minister in early 1997 the enclave was excluded from such talks Push To Open Up Negotiations Ghukasian who was elected Kocharians successor in 1997 told RFERL on 18 February that he sees only one way to change that Armenia should opt out of further talks and let Stepanakert make its own case with Baku  There is only one way Karabakh can enter the negotiating process Armenias refusal to negotiate with Azerbaijan Ghukasian said There is no other way out As long as Armenia talks to Azerbaijan without the involvement of NagornoKarabakh Azerbaijan will refuse to negotiate with Karabakh Its as simple as thatArmenian officials have repeatedly called for the inclusion of Karabakh representatives in talks under the Minsk Group aegis but have not shown any sign of willingness to relinquish their role in the peace processAt the same time Ghukasian acknowledged that tactic is not without risks Azerbaijan might be tempted to take advantage of the Armenian refusal either to delay a settlement indefinitely or to launch a military campaign to bring Karabakh back under its control  Azerbaijan has doubled and even trebled military spending in recent years and senior officials including President Ilham Aliyev and Defense Minister Colonel General Safar Abiyev have repeatedly hinted that if negotiations fail to yield a settlement on Bakus terms Azerbaijan would be justified in resorting to arms Armenian officials for their part have repeatedly called for the inclusion of Karabakh representatives in talks under the Minsk Group aegis but have not shown any sign of willingness to relinquish their role in the peace process  Resolution Hopes The Minsk Group cochairs said in December 2005 and January 2006 that talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in 2005 yielded progress towards a solution to the conflict and hinted that 2006 might bring a major breakthrough  Armenias Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijans Ilham Aliyev met earlier this month in France AFPThose predictions raised hopes that at their summit in Rambouillet France on 1011 February the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan Kocharian and Aliyev might actually sign a short declaration of basic principles that would serve as the foundation for a more detailed and comprehensive settlement  In the event the two presidents failed to do so A diplomat involved in the talks later told RFERL that the two key sticking points are Karabakhs future status and the timeframe for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijans Kelbacar district which lies between the NKR and the ArmenianAzerbaijani border  Independence Recognition Ghukasian suggested that in the event that no progress is made in the peace talks the Karabakh leadership might seek to pressure the Armenian leadership to recognize the NKR as an independent state I think that if all goes on like this if we see that Azerbaijan is really unprepared for concessions we will have to raise the issue of Armenias recognition of Karabakh he said Successive Armenian leaderships have insisted that Yerevan will not be the first state to acknowledge Karabakhs independence although it would follow suit immediately after another state sets the precedent The Karabakh leaderships claims to independence derive from a referendum held in November 1991 in accordance with Soviet legislation still in force at that time that granted autonomous formations the same theoretical right to secede from the union republics of which they were a part that the union republics enjoyed visavis the USSR  Ghukasians interview coincided almost to the day with the 20 February 1988 appeal by the local Soviet of the then NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast to the USSR Supreme Soviet to designate the region part of the Armenian Soviet republic It was that appeal that served as the catalyst for a conflict that has lasted 18 years and has polarized the populations of Armenia and Azerbaijan On 18 February  the day of Gukasians interview  the online daily echoazcom reported that some Azerbaijanis now support the idea of building a great wall along the border between the two countries  not so much for defense but as a reminder to future generations of Armenias aggression and inherent hostility RFERLs Armenian Service contributed to this reportThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map

https://www.rferl.org/a/1065648.html,NagornoKarabakh Peace May Depend On Military Situation ,"February 10, 2006 16:39 GMT",,The region has been subject to a global shift of the geopolitical landscape in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and one of the most dynamic aspects of this shift has been the direct engagement  and presence  of the US military For the first time in history the United States is now operationally active in each of the three countries of the South Caucasus As with a number of other distant regions and countries geographic isolation no longer meant strategic marginalization in terms of US military policy and planningPivot PointAlthough the establishment of a ceasefire agreement in May 1994 effectively fixed and froze the conflict sides the US military presence may actually be a dynamic force in thawing the frozen conflict into an intensified jockeying for position by both sides Yet the backdrop of undeclared war and unresolved conflict remains the core obstacle to longterm development and integration together with longstanding regional blockades and embargos of trade transport and energy Even more disruptive however the NagornoKarabakh issue still defines and deforms the political parameters in both Azerbaijan and ArmeniaHowever the US military and security mission in Azerbaijan may yet emerge as a pivotal starting point for lasting regional stabilizationAlthough Georgia is in many ways the center of gravity for the US military in the South Caucasus Azerbaijan offers unique considerations for Americas war on terrorism Azerbaijans strategic importance has been redefined far surpassing Washingtons earlier overemphasis on oil and gas pipelines to reflect a much more sophisticated agenda It may also include greater American responsibility however as any progress in the NagornoKarabakh talks will most likely bring new demands and expectations from both sidesThe military architecture of the US presence in Azerbaijan is also rooted in the new post11 September 2001 strategy of moving away from a large footprint and relying on formal military bases to smaller forward operating locations or lily pads In Azerbaijan the US military favored the establishment of even smaller and less visible cooperative security locations tactical facilities with prepositioned stocks that provide contingency access With such locations in place US forces could achieve greater mobility and facilitate faster and more effective missions either along Azerbaijans southern border with Iran or its northern borders with Georgia and DaghestanPillars Of The RelationshipThe US military also expanded bilateral relations with Azerbaijan This militarytomilitary relationship blossomed after the US Congress altered its prohibition on most US governmenttogovernment aid to Azerbaijan until it ends blockades and other offensive use of force against Armenia That prohibition enacted into law in 1992 as Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act was modified in 2002 to allow for an annual presidential waiver to allow for a significant expansion of US military and security assistanceCurrently there are four essential pillars of US military interests in Azerbaijan comprising broad areas of security driven by the new demands of waging a global war on terror The first two focus on the general goals of fostering regional stability and security and forging cooperative assistance in countering terrorism The third and fourth pillars comprise countering the proliferation of chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons and maintaining access to the Caucasus air corridor which is essential for projecting power into Central Asia and AfghanistanTo accomplish these goals the US militarys European Command EUCOM has launched several initiatives focusing both on the region as a whole and on Azerbaijan specifically A regional initiative the South Caucasus Clearinghouse emulates the Baltic model of establishing a new forum to serve as a multinational forum for interested countries to share information on their securityassistance programs for Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan to deconflict those programs and to determine areas in which to collaborate or cooperate according to a EUCOM statement  A second initiative tailored to reflect both Azerbaijans unique security needs and its linkage to Central Asia consists of a threepronged effort of counterproliferation counterterrorism and hydrocarbon security This effort the socalled Caspian Guard was launched in 2003 and involves Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and focuses on maritime and border security in the Caspian Sea regionThe Caspian Guard incorporates integrated airspace and maritime surveillance control and command It also encourages greater coordination and cooperation in crisisresponse efforts by the Azerbaijani and Kazakh naval forces The effort was further bolstered in July 2004 by a 20 million program to provide training and equipment for Azerbaijans Maritime Border Guard Specialized tactical training and combined exercises are also provided by US Special Operations ForcesRussian ResponseThis Caspian initiative has prompted a Russian reaction Last week Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minster Sergei Ivanov called for the creation of a Russiancentered Caspian naval force This Russian initiative although mimicking the wellestablished US effort seeks to outflank the Caspian Guard by including Iran and Turkmenistan But the real significance of the Russian proposal is its clear challenge to US military ties with Baku And this challenge may yet prove effective as the Azerbaijani response remains unclear suggesting a bid to pressure the Americans to please the Russians or even to exploit bothBut in light of the opportunities inherent in these sophisticated initiatives not to mention the assistance garnered from membership of NATOs Partnership for Peace PfP program how has the Azerbaijani military benefited from the US military engagementIronically the Azerbaijani armed forces have seen only a limited set of meager results Despite a massive increase in defense spending and an even mightier chorus of bellicose statements from the Azerbaijani leadership the military remains seriously neglected Increased Western and US training and military education for Azerbaijani officers is stymied by a system of promotion and assignment governed more by personal ties than by professional merit Even impressive experience in overseas peacekeeping deployments in Kosova Afghanistan and Iraq go unrecognized upon return to Azerbaijan In terms of military policy any deepening of ties with the United States or NATO is seen as secondary to the more strategic need to expand military relations with Russia both to respond to Armenias position as a key Russian ally and to maintain Azerbaijans arsenal of Sovietera weaponryFormidable ObstaclesThere are moreover two entrenched obstacles to military reform in Azerbaijan First the Azerbaijani armed forces face an unseen enemy institutionalized corruption With a combination of the Defense Ministry a longserving center of state corruption and the defense minster himself the longestserving defense minister in the former Soviet Union real reform has never taken hold This is a legacy of President Ilham Aliyevs father the cunning former KGB General and late President Heydar Aliyev who saw the military as the only true threat to his powerThe second obstacle which has become increasingly visible in recent months is perhaps the most challenging  namely the politicization of the military Despite its repeated threats of renewed war to retake NagornoKarabakh militarily the Azerbaijani leadership whose lack of legitimacy in the eyes of the population constitutes a dangerous vulnerability still fears a strong military This vulnerability has been exacerbated by the regimes fearful observation of political change in Georgia Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan The Azerbaijani perspective sees the NagornoKarabakh conflict as a political  not a military  issue and a source of nationalist credentials deemed essential as the most effective way to ensure regime survivalThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict zoneIn February 1988 the local assembly in Stepanakert the local capital of

territory of the former Soviet Union and remains one of its most miserable In three bitter years the conflict over NagornoKarabakh consumed the lives of 25000 people turned more than a million into

miserable In three bitter years the conflict over NagornoKarabakh consumed the lives of 25000 people turned more than a million into refugees and devastated the economies of Armenia and AzerbaijanToday 12 years after a ceasefire that froze the fighting but settled nothing the entire region is paying the social and economic consequences But there is a glimmer of hope as the diplomatic marathon may be bearing fruit There is talk of a potential deal In an interview with RFERL last week the US cochairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europes Minsk Group Stephen Mann said the peace process was moving in the right direction The OSCE Minsk Group has been mediating the Karabakh peace talks since 1994 All of us recognize that we are at the stage where we have to turn the corner from negotiations to decision Speaking from the American perspective we believe that the possibility for a deal exists in the months ahead Mann said So I think the meetings that are coming up are a very important opportunity We do not want the sides to fail to take advantage of this important opportunityChange In ApproachThe guarded optimism it seems stems from a shift in the Armenian position away from insistence on a package approach to the Karabakh problems whereby all issues including the final status of Karabakh should be solved simultaneously By all accounts Yerevan is now prepared to accept a stepbystep approach Tom de Waal an expert on the Caucasus who is in the Azerbaijani capital Baku for the Russianlanguage launch of his book on the conflict Black Garden thinks this has encouraged Azerbaijan to be more flexibleThe expectation here is that something will happen in Paris on Friday but that it will probably be just some kind of declaration  maybe a declaration of basic principles and obviously there are some fairly serious negotiations going on I think talking to people in the Foreign Ministry that the tone has changed They are talking much more constructively much more in detail about things than they were a couple of years ago de Waal said But how much room does either side have for maneuver Both sides have encouraged their respective societies to demonize the other And Azerbaijanis have become accustomed to think that time is on their side that their booming oil revenues will alter the military balance in their favor Paata Zakareishvili a Georgian specialist on conflict resolution who has just returned from a series of meetings in Armenia and Azerbaijan thinks that the biggest problem in both countries is the failure of governments to prepare people for compromise Peoples minds are completely closed Society is not informed at all Here in Georgia for instance were always talking about the federal solution or some other concept or other and this prepares the public for something to happen in Abkhazia Were always discussing something But there there is no discussion whatsoever of concepts proposals and plans All they discuss are Armenias interests on the one hand and Azerbaijans on the other Zakareishvili said Its a view shared by de Waal who fears that the failure of the leaders of both countries to prepare and educate their peoples is storing up problems for the future The leaders in private have been having quite detailed confidential discussions about a compromise and society is still stuck in the early 1990s and late 1980s and still stuck with a very aggressive rhetoric towards the other In that sense the leaders have become trapped Even if they make an agreement itll be very hard for them to sell it and theyll be quite vulnerable and I think this is where things will get difficult For the moment the flame of hope still flickers in the corridors of the OSCE offices in Vienna Not so in the refugee camps of Azerbaijan where it has long since been extinguished For the hundreds of thousands of people expelled from Karabakh and the adjoining territories by Armenian forces in 1994 life has stood still these last 12 years Untouched by the oil wealth that has come to Azerbaijan these refugees still harbor the dream of return to their homes Perhaps this week in Paris the leaders of both sides will make the first faltering steps to a compromise that might one day make that possibleThe NagornoKarabakh ConflictClick on the image to view an enlarged map of the NagornoKarabakh conflict

through RussianGeorgian relations was again on vivid public display at President Vladimir Putins Kremlin press conference on 30 January Asked by a Georgian journalist whether the recent pipeline explosions in Russia that cut off the gas supply to Georgia were part of an energy war against Tbilisi Putin criticized the Georgian government The problem he said was that certain political leaders in Georgia appeared unable to adequately appreciate the state of relations between the two countriesSo a misfortune has happened  yes supplies of gas to Georgia have been stopped But our specialists are working night and day in the mountains in minus 30 degrees Celsius of frost in order to restore energy supplies to Georgia And what do we hear and see from the Georgian leadership They just spit at us Putin saidBitter RelationsThat is not of course how the Georgians see things President Mikheil Saakashvili is no less bitter than his Russian counterpart He has accused Moscow of deliberately sabotaging the pipeline in the middle of the coldest Georgian winter in decadesThe aim of the explosions was to demoralize Georgia and show the entire world that we were weak and a feeble country without perspective Saakashvili said Instead this sabotage produced completely the opposite result it turned out that we have a very strong society Our society emerged strengthened from this crisisThe chasm that divides Georgia and its resentful northern neighbor is becoming wider And that will perhaps have important consequences for Russias control of the South Caucasus As in Ukraine and the Baltic states Russias leverage has rested in considerable part on control of the energy supply Until this month Georgia was 100 percent dependent on Russian gas Not any more At the critical moment Georgia turned to Iran for help and got itToday 30 January an event of historical importance has occurred thanks to the fact that last year we restored the IranAzerbaijanGeorgia pipeline in readiness for just such an eventuality For the first time since the restoration of Georgian independence Georgia is being supplied not just with Russian gas but with an alternative source Of course we will sharply strengthen our work in this direction Saakashvili saidGas From IranIts the last sentence that is the really significant one It appears to suggest that the Georgians would like to make the Iranian solution a permanent one Georgias Energy Minister Nika Gilauri back from talks in Iran said that Russian policy has played a clear role in prompting Georgia to secure the independence and security of its energy supply Although in any case any country with just one supplier of energy would be forced to look for additional sources and additional supplier countries he said  Tbilisi residents huddle around campfires during the gas crunch in January epaThe gas from Azerbaijan and Iran delivers about 4 million cubic meters a day  still just 30 percent of Georgias needs But from next year Georgia will have more options when the completion of the BakuTbilisiErzurum pipeline brings gas from Azerbaijans Shah Deniz line on stream US RelationsMight it not irritate Washington though that its ally in the Caucasus is turning to Iran for helpWhen Saakashvili spoke by telephone to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on 30 January Georgias energy problems topped the agenda Given the US desire to strengthen Georgias economic independence  and in particular its energy independence  it seems prepared to turn a blind eye to Georgias Iranian deal The Georgian presidents press office reported after the conversation with Rice that the United States was ready to provide assistance in ensuring the energy security of GeorgiaBut the ramifications of this particular spat dont stop in Georgia Armenia the most loyal of Russian allies has also begun to grumble The pipeline that supplies its gas from Russia is the same one that supplies Georgia  so the explosions cut its gas off as well And Gazprom has also just doubled the price of gas to Armenia and Georgia to 110 per 1000 cubic meters Little wonder then that the Armenians regard the latest crisis as complete vindication of their decision to begin importing gas from Iran using a pipeline now under construction Russia is believed to be opposed to the project and according to the Moscow daily Kommersant offered at one point to keep the gas price at 59 in return for a 45 percent stake in the Armenian section of the pipeline This prompted outrage in Armenia but was immediately denied by Armenian presidential spokesman Viktor SoghomonyanBut the controversy may not stop there Iran  and Georgia  would like to link the new ArmeniaIran pipeline up to the Shah Deniz line that is now nearing completion This would give Georgia even greater access to Iranian gas and link the Iranian market up to Europe Some observers have speculated that Russia has forced the Armenian government to reduce the pipelines planned diameter to prevent Iranian gas being reexportedGas FactsClick on the map for an enlarged imageUkraine consumes 70 billion cubic meters bcm of gas per year It produces 20 bcm of

problems for the benefit of all people living in conflictstricken territories If people believe that Kosovo can be granted full independence why then should we deny it to Abkhazia and South Ossetia he said ,We need common principles to find a fair solution to these problems for the benefit of all people living in conflictstricken territories If people believe that Kosovo can be granted full independence why then should we deny it to Abkhazia and South Ossetia he said  I am not speaking about how Russia will act However we know that Turkey for instance has recognized the Republic of Northern Cyprus Putin added I do not want to say that Russia will immediately recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states but such precedent does exist South Ossetia And Abkhazia React Eduard Kokoity president of the unrecognized Republic of South Ossetia hailed Putins call for the application of universal principles  Kokoity said the same day that Putins new approach signals a break with double standards that ignore the universally accepted right of peoples to selfdetermination and divide peoples into good and bad of whom the good are considered more equal  Also on 31 January Boris Chochiev first deputy prime minister of the unrecognized Republic of South Ossetia told regnumru that Putins statement is a timely signal to those countries that continue to ignore the will of states that have exercised the right to selfdetermination  Sergei Shamba foreign minister of the unrecognized Republic of Abkhazia told regnumru that Abkhazia has even weightier arguments to bolster its claims to independence than does Kosova  Georgian Rejection Speaking to journalists in Tbilisi on 31 January Georgian Foreign Minister Gela Bezhuashvili claimed that most of the states engaged in mediating a settlement of the Kosova conflict do not agree with the Putins argument  Bezhuashvili said the Kosova settlement requires a very delicate very cautious approach that cannot be applied universally to other conflicts  Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli similarly argued that the Kosova solution cannot be applied to Georgia because solutions to the Abkhaz and South Ossetian conflicts must preserve Georgias territorial integrity Caucasus Press reported on 31 January  NagornoKarabakh And Transdniester React Vahram Atanesian who heads the parliament commission on foreign relations of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic was cautious in his response to Putins comments He told regnumru that while Karabakh hails Moscows active interest in resolving the Karabakh conflict it will hardly prove possible to find a universal principle applicable to all conflicts given that each conflict has its own ethnopolitical and religious history He said the Karabakh conflict requires a unique approach  Yevgeny Shevchuk chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Moldovas breakaway Transdniester Republic told regnumru that the international communitys proposed solution for Kosova will serve as an algorithm for solving the Transdniester conflict He added that there are numerous analogies between the two LF Skepticism Sergei Markov director of the Institute of Political Studies that has close ties to the Kremlin pointed out on 31 January that while Russia opposes independence for Kosova because Serbia is Russias ally it is prepared to agree to independence for Kosova provided that the precedent becomes universal and is then extended to the four deadlocked CIS conflicts regnumru reported  Markov predicted that the international community will try to impose independence on Kosova from a position of force and likewise from a position of force similarly will seek to prevent the unrecognized states from achieving independence  He warned that failure to extend the Kosova precedent to postSoviet conflicts would only destabilize the situation in the regions in question Serbian observers have adduced the same argument when rejecting independent status for Kosova  Institute of the Countries of the CIS Director Konstantin Zatulin similarly predicted on 31 January that while the international community in particular the United States has all but signed off on independence for Kosova it will not agree to extending the same principle to postSoviet conflicts regnumru reportedSpotlight On Kosovo  THE WORLDS NEWEST NATION The region of Kosovo has a population of more than 2 million some 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanians It was one of the poorest regions in the former Yugoslavia but has considerable mineral wealth and an enterprising population many of whom work abroad but keep close contact with Kosovo All ethnic Albanian political parties seek independence on the principles of selfdetermination and majority rule They feel that Serbia lost its historically based claim to what was its autonomous province under the 1974 constitution by revoking that autonomy in the late 1980s and then conducting a crackdown in 1999 that forced some 850000 people to flee their homesSince NATOs intervention that year to stop the expulsions Kosovo has been under a UN administration UNMIK The UN has begun to gradually transfer functions to elected Kosovar institutions The primary Serbian concerns are physical safety for the local Serbian minority a secure return for the tens of thousands of Serbian displaced persons and protection for historic Serbian religious buildings The main problems affecting all Kosovars however are economic Until Kosovos final status is clarified and new legislation passed and enforced it will not be able to attract the investment it needs to provide jobs for its population which is one of the youngest and fastest growing in Europe Prosperity is widely seen as the key to political stability and interethnic coexistence in Kosovo as is the case in much of Southeastern EuropeFor an archive of RFERLs coverage of developments in the disputed region of KOSOVO click here

expect from this meeting of the presidents Many expect a breakthrough Whats your opinion  Steven Mann First of all the cochairs are going to be going to Baku and Yerevan this week for further meetings with the foreign ministers Azerbaijans Elmar Mammadyarov and Armenias Vartan Oskanian and with the presidents as part of our preparation for France And then next week at the invitation of President Jacques Chirac the presidents will be coming to France and there will participate in discussions under the umbrella of the OSCE cochairs So thats what we have looking forward  What I would say is this We have been working in the context of the Prague process promoting direct contact between the two foreign ministers for almost two years now where we have had serious and detailed discussions and negotiations between the two sides And the presidents themselves have met a number of times for talks on Karabakh  I think all of us recognize that we are at the stage where we have to turn the corner from negotiation to decision And speaking from the American perspective we believe that the possibility for a deal exists in the months ahead So I think the meetings that are coming up in the next two weeks are a very important opportunity And again speaking from the American side we do not want the sides to fail to take advantage of this important opportunity  RFERL What exactly will you be discussing there in Paris and what exactly will the presidents be discussing under your supervision  Mann What exactly of course I cant say because we dont want to violate the confidentiality of the negotiations But I expect that the full range of issues related to a Nagorno Karabakh agreement will be under discussion  RFERL Almost every institution that is directly or indirectly involved with these peace talks says there is an option on the table of the return of the occupied territories and a possible referendum  an expression of the will of the population of NagornoKarabakh What can you tell us about this  Mann In a word nothing Because I dont want to go into any of the substance of the negotiations But I will say that the process has been moving in the right direction it has been moving in the right direction for some time and there are extremely substantial benefits that we could look forward to for each side in this Any agreement has to have a winwin outcome There has to be something in it for each side And I believe that the discussions have been moving in that direction  Now the issues are very difficult issues If the subject were less difficult it would have been solved years ago Even with the best of will on each side  and we do have good will on the part of each foreign minister and each president  but even with the best of will these are very very difficult issues So I do not minimize the task But that said I believe that with dedication some flexibility and political will 2006 can be the year for a Karabakh agreement  RFERL Are any promises being made to the sides that if they come to an agreement there will be full international support for example on the issue of reconstruction rebuilding the occupied territories Will there will be any financial support  Mann Oh I think absolutely Without going into the details I think major international support and reconstruction for all sides that have been affected in this must be a part of a deal  RFERL What will be the format of the Paris meeting Will the two presidents meet with Chirac and then stay with him in his residency Or will all of you get together there  Mann I must refer any questions about the substance the framework of the visit itself to my French colleague Bernard Fassier  RFERL One thing that is known already Mr Ambassador is that Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian has said himself there is a paper on the table  its not an agreement or a formal document  but there is a paper on which both sides outline the basic principles of an agreement and they might sign that What can you tell us about this paper  Mann I dont want to get into any of the issues of the substance of the talks so Im going to have to leave that to the side  RFERL What is your message to both sides at this important moment  Mann I dont think I have a sound bite to give you But what Ive said reflects accurately the way the American government is looking at thisTurkish Foreign Minister Abdullah GulOn January 25 RFERL Azerbaijani Service correspondent Mayis Alizade spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister ABDULLAH GUL about prospects for a breakthrough in resolving the NagornoKarabakh conflictRFERL The general understanding is that 2006 might be the year for a breakthrough in the NagornoKarabakh conflictGUL We hope an acceptable resolution will be reached in 2006 Our concern is that other factors might hinder this process if it is delayed and no solution can be found The solution of this conflict would greatly ease the situation in the CaucasusRFERL After a long controversy and discussion at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe the Azerbaijani delegations credentials were approved But pointing to the shortcomings in democratization and reforms PACE Raporteur Andreas Gross said PACE has been monitoring the situation in Azerbaijan for the last five years and there is no major improvementGUL This is an important process Every country goes through it To boost democracy and reforms is something to benefit the countries themselves and one should not leave it only to the European Council and the European Parliament I am sure that if there are problems with regard to these reforms the Azerbaijani government will deal with them and these problems will be resolved I believe the Council of Europe is very important for Azerbaijan It wasnt easy to get to there I know that myself because I worked for it quite hardRFERL You are saying Azerbaijan should appreciate the Council of Europes valueGUL No both sides should appreciate this relationship

https://www.rferl.org/a/1065233.html,Russia Does Gazprom Have A Master Pipeline Plan ,"January 30, 2006 14:20 GMT",After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 Viktor Chernomyrdin  then head of Gazprom and on the way to being appointed prime minister  devised a plan to maintain as a single unit falling under Gazproms purview the gas transportation infrastructure of Russia Ukraine and Belarus ,After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 Viktor Chernomyrdin  then head of Gazprom and on the way to being appointed prime minister  devised a plan to maintain as a single unit falling under Gazproms purview the gas transportation infrastructure of Russia Ukraine and Belarus  In formulating the plan Chernomyrdin and his advisers were following the most fundamental principle in gas geopolitics  the winners need not only access to large gas reserves but also efficient systems for delivering that gas to market  He who controls the pipelines therefore controls the buyer  and to some degree the country where the gas originates   Pipeline Problems It was a good plan  but it failed Ukraine and Belarus refused to give up what they considered the lucrative business of gas transit and insisted on nationalizing the pipelines on their territory The main components of the former Soviet system were divvied up between the three states  But Gazprom looking at the defeat as a shortterm setback set itself the farreaching goal of buying up much of the gas transit systems in the former Soviet Union as well as in Eastern and Central Europe Its hope was to someday control the entire regional gas distribution system  To date Gazprom has had only mild success realizing its plan in the FSU The preindependence gas pipeline system in Belarus for example is still controlled by Beltransgas the stateowned pipeline company This should not be confused with the postSoviet YamalEurope pipeline built and owned by Gazprom which carries Russian gas through Belarus to Poland and on to Germany  In Ukraine the Soyuz pipeline and the twothread Urengoy Uzhgorod pipeline remain under Kyivs control Georgia  still shivering from its abrupt shutoff of Russian gas after apparent pipeline sabotage last week  likewise resists pressure from Moscow to cede control over its pipeline in exchange for cheaper gas Gazprom is estimated to have spent 26 billion on shareholdings in dozens of gas ventures in Italy France Austria Serbia Greece Finland Turkey and elsewhere Elsewhere Gazprom is gaining ground Armenia trying to diversify its energy sources is currently building a pipeline to Iran Gazprom however has insisted the diameter of the pipe be smaller than originally planned  in order to prevent Armenian from shipping surplus Iranian gas to Georgia  In Estonia Gazprom owns a greater share of the national gas company AS Eesti Gaas 3064 percent than the Estonian government 27 percent Eesti Gaas in turn owns the countrys gas transportation system  The list of other Gazprom holdings in former Soviet republics includes Moldovas Gazsnabtranzit where Gazprom owns 50 percent of the authorized capital and Lithuanias Stella Vitae of which it owns 30 percent Gazprom also owns 25 percent of Latvias Latvias Gaze  And Gazprom of course has a significant presence even beyond the former Soviet Union  Poland The gas pipeline system running through Poland was built jointly with Russia and Gazprom holds a 50percent share Gazprom also holds 46 percent of the Polish company EvRoPol Gaz  In 2005 Gazprom arranged for Poland to buy 34 billion cubic meters of gas from RosUkrEnergo RUE the Swissbased company now serving as an intermediary in Russias controversial gas deal with Ukraine Platts Commodity News reported that in September 2005 RUE became the main supplier of Russian gas to Poland Gazprom also holds a 35percent stake in Polands Gas Trading consortium and nearly half of EuRoPol Gaz jointstock company  Germany In the early spring of 1991 Gazprom attempted to buy a 25 percent stake in Verbundnetz Gas AG which operated the entire gas distribution system in the former East Germany  But despite help from the German chemical company BASF Gazprom was not allowed to take part in the tender and the stake was bought by Germanys Ruhrgas  Gazproms bid was primarily based on a wish to lower its dependency on Ruhrgas Ruhrgas had been dictating the prices it paid for Russian gas a practice that angered Chernomyrdin He felt that Russia as the seller was in a position to name the price it wanted to charge  But in the ensuing years Gazprom was able to gain a considerable presence in the German gas market through its partnership and joint venture agreements with the German gas company Wintershall Today it has three major joint ventures with Wintershall Wingas WIEH and WIEE as well as agreements with Ruhrgas Verbundnetz Gas and Siemens AG  Hungary Gazprom holds a 50percent stake in Hungarys Panruysgaz And in 2001 it set its sights on the countrys chemical company BorsodChem This was not only for its chemicals but also because it owned a minority stake in TVK Hungarys second largest chemical firm which also controlled a large part of the countrys pipelines  A Europol report from September 2001 reported that 248 percent of BorsodChems shares were owned by a principal Hungarian bank that was simultaneously acting on behalf of Sibur the Russian petrochemical firm controlled by Gazprom in acquiring more shares  The report went on to say a further 8 percent of BorodsChem was owned by MDM a Russian bank A further 5 percent was owned by unidentified financial investors two of whom were linked to organized crime groups in St Petersburg and another of whom worked in collusion with MDM  Europol also noted that Austrian investment bank Vienna Capital Partners colluded with Sibur in coordinating share bids in BorodsChem  In the end Gazprom did not succeed in gaining a share in Hungarys pipeline system But Gazprom has used the same tactics elsewhere to better effect  Slovakia Gazproms activities in Slovakia are significant since most gas which transits through Ukraine bound for Europe first enters Slovakia and is then routed further west  In April 1997 a series of agreements were signed between Chernomyrdin and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar that gave Slovakias national gas company SPP a discount of 5 per thousand cubic meters S lovakia used 6 billion cubic meters of gas in 1997 In return a GazpromSlovak joint venture was created to transport Russian gas to the EU The exact terms of the joint venture were never published The 1997 agreements are to expire in 2008 In July 2002 the European Commission approved the purchase of a 49percent stake in SPP by Gazprom Ruhrgas and Gaz de France He who controls the pipelines controls the buyer  and to some degree the country where the gas originates The deal was worth 27 billion and was financed by Ruhrgas and Gaz de France Gazprom paid a third of this sum in installments The SPP pipeline system transports about 70 percent of all gas supplied from Russia via Ukraine to Europe Gazprom also holds a 50percent stake in Slovakias Slovrusgaz  And the investments dont end there Gazprom has shareholdings in Italys Volta 39 percent the BritishBelgian company Interconnector 10 percent Frances Fragaz 50 percent and similar companies in Austria Serbia Greece Finland Bulgaria and Turkey In October 2005 the amount Gazprom had spent on those investments was estimated at 26 billionThe International Herald Tribune cited Emmanuel Bergasse administrator for Central and Eastern Europe and the International Energy Agency as saying Gazprom has substantial market power from being the supplier of gas down to the customer It is the chain that counts  He added Gazproms stated aim is to extend its dominant position with obvious consequences for European energy diversificationRussias Gas StrategyRUNNING HOT AND COLD The crisis over Russian supplies of natural gas to Ukraine that erupted on New Years Day has implications that spread well beyond these two countries and will impact both economic and political policymaking throughout Europe On January 19 RFERLs Washington DC office hosted a briefing the examined the ramifications of the naturalgas conflictCLIFFORD GADDY a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution outlined Russias grand energy strategy in which Ukraine is perceived as merely an obstacle frustrating Russias energy ambitions in Western Europe and therefore a nonentity in Russias broader strategic planning According to Gaddy Russias strategic goal regarding energy is to maximize the role of its own energy resources in the world energy markets so as to increase its geopolitical influence To do this it must reduce competition and maximize dependency on its own energy resources as well as ensure a stable supplyTARAS KUZIO a visiting assistant professor at George Washington University rebutted Gaddys argument claiming that Russias actions evidenced a complete lack of geopolitical strategy and resulted in strong denunciations by Western countries and a loss of political allies in Ukraine According to Kuzio Russian President Vladimir Putins desire to have a deal signed by the January 4 European Union energy summit outweighed his hope of reinforcing opposition to Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko during the runup to Ukraines March 26 parliamentary electionsRFERL Coordinator of Corruption Studies ROMAN KUPCHINSKY did not fully agree with Kuzios assessments of Yushchenko or Ukraine He outlined three major problems that are feeding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine The biggest he argues is that the statecontrolled Russian gas giant Gazprom holds a monopoly on naturalgas sales outside the CIS Kupchinsky also decried Ukraines consumption of natural gas terming it out of control Corruption is also a major factor in the conflict Kupchinsky said although the extent to which it taints the deal struck between Russia and Ukraine remains

under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk Group were being watched closely for any indication that a February meeting between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev might result in a compromise,The discussions held in London on 1819 January under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk Group were being watched closely for any indication that a February meeting between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev might result in a compromiseUncertainty Of PrinciplesArmenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian did confirm the day after the London talks that the two sides are seeking to reach agreement on a halfpage document that enumerates general principles that could then form the basis for a more detailed peace plan But Oskanian said that while the two sides positions visavis some of those principles have drawn closer on others their positions are still far apart RFERLs Armenian Service reported Dayaz on 26 January similarly quoted Mammadyarov as telling journalists in Baku that the two sides are still trying to reach agreement on the general principles It therefore remains unclear whether the two countries presidents will indeed succeed in reaching a compromise on the contested points let alone publicly endorse those basic principles during their upcoming summit near Paris which Kocharians spokesman has said will take place on 10 February Azerbaijani presidential administration official Novruz Mammadov hinted in a 20 January interview with the online daily echoaz com that it is unlikely the two presidents will sign any agreements during their first meeting of the yearThe basic principles have formed the focus of what has become known as the Prague process talks between Oskanian and Mammadyarov socalled because the first few meetings took place inPrague in the summer of 2004 and January 2005 On 7 June 2005 Mammadyarov told journalists in Baku that the two sides were discussing between seven and nine issues relatedto a peace settlement and that those issues had to be addressed in a specific order with each made secure before the following is added like pearls knotted on a silk thread The BlueprintsMammadyarov said Azerbaijan insists on the liberation of the seven Azerbaijani districts bordering on Karabakh that are currently occupied by Armenian forces He also claimed the two sides were discussing which countries or organizations could provide peacekeeping forces to be deployed on those territories after their liberation according to dayaz Echoazcom quoted Mammadyarov as saying that the two sides were discussing both phased and package approaches to resolving the conflict But a senior Armenian Foreign Ministry official told RFERL on 8 June on condition of anonymity that the final agreement will be a package one although its various provisions may be implemented one after the other rather than simultaneouslyThen in early July 2005 a senior Armenian official told RFERLs Armenian Service that under the anticipated peace deal Armenia would return to Azerbaijani control five of the seven Azerbaijani districts adjacent to Karabakh currently occupied by Karabakh Armenian forces not including the strategic Lacin corridor An international peacekeeping force would be deployed in the conflict zone under the aegis of the OSCE Then at some unspecified future date the population of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic would be required to vote in a referendum on the regions future status That blueprint is very similar to those proposed in December 2004 by former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio and NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche and by the International Crisis Group in a document released on 11 October 2005 although the ICG plan envisages the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all seven occupied Azerbaijani districts including LacinHaik Kotandjian an adviser to Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian outlined an alternative road map for resolving the conflict in a 22 November interview with regnumru That threestage plan comprised the same elements but in reverse order it envisaged a referendum on the status of the NKR followed by the deployment of international peacekeepers and the simultaneous withdrawal of Armenian forces from five of the occupied districts not including Lacin and Kalbacar the third stage comprised the rehabilitation of the conflict zoneNear SuccessesIn early July 2005 Armenian officials told RFERLs Armenian Service that Armenia and Azerbaijan had reached agreement on the key points of a formal peace accord ending the Karabakh conflict and that agreement could be signed by the end of this year The two ministers and the two presidents subsequently met in late August in Kazan on the sidelines of a CIS summit but failed to announce any major progress toward a settlement Then on 4 December Oskanian told RFERL that he and Mammadyarov failed during talks in Ljubljana on the sidelines of the OSCE foreign ministers annual meeting to agree on a date for the next meeting between the two presidents  a meeting that Oskanian hinted could prove a pivotal moment in the search or a settlementBut despite that failure to schedule a meeting between the two presidents preparations were launched for one aspect of a peace settlement provision was made for a highlevel OSCE planning group to visit the Karabakh conflict zone to assess the requirements for deploying an international peacekeeping force in the event of the withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the Azerbaijani territory contiguous to the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic that they currently occupy Noyan Tapan reported on 22 January the arrival of that delegation in Stepanakert  Azerbaijani soldiers in NagornoKarabakh in 1992 AFPIn a 19 January interview with APA news agency that was posted the following day on dayaz Azerbaijani presidential administration official Mammadov said that Azerbaijans overriding priorities are for Armenia to agree to a settlement of the conflict that would preserve Azerbaijans territorial integrity and the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory Mammadov dismissed as unimportant the issue of including representatives of the NKR in the peace process which the ICG plan advocates He said that peacekeeping forces should be deployed along the entire length of the ArmenianAzerbaijani border and between Armenian and Azerbaijanipopulated villages He said it was premature to discuss the possibility of a referendum which would he estimated be held only in 1520 years timeDeputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov President Aliyevs special representative for the Karabakh talks was more categorical telling journalists in Baku on 23 January that talk of a referendum is no more than rumors dayaz reportedReality CheckNeither Mammadov nor Azimov appears to have made the crucial point noted on 19 January by the online daily zerkaloaz that Article 3 of the Azerbaijani Constitution explicitly bars the possibility of changes to the countrys borders being submitted to a nationwide referendum For such a referendum to take place a preliminary referendum would first have to be held to amend those articles of the constitution and few Azerbaijani voters are likely to endorse any amendments that would facilitate the loss of Azerbaijani jurisdiction over KarabakhEven if the two presidents succeed during the coming year in finalizing a set of general principles intended to serve as the blueprint for a more detailed peace plan there is still no guarantee that one side or the other will not find it expedient to renege on them at some future date The socalled Paris Principles agreed on in the spring of 2001 were elaborated on in further talks in Florida in April 2001 and during subsequent meetings between Kocharian and Ilham Aliyevs father and predecessor Heydar Aliyev US diplomat Rudolf Perina who served as the US Minsk Group cochairman during those talks later revealed that in 2002 the two sides came incredibly close to hammering out a peace agreement But Armenian officials say Baku reneged on that deal

late on 19 January by Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian in an interview with RFERLs Armenian ServiceI can now confirm that there will be a new meeting between the two presidents and that the French side has already handed the invitations to both presidents Oskanian said The venue and the exact day of the meeting will be finalized by the French side and they should announce it soon in the coming daysFrance cochairs the Minsk Group of nations mandated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE to mediate in the talks Russia and the United States are the other cochairsAll three countries have been acting as mediators since 1997 nearly three years after Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to suspend military hostilitiesPredominantly ethnic Armenian Karabakh seceded from then Soviet Azerbaijan in 1988 triggering a war that claimed some 30000 lives and drove over 800000 people  mostly Azeris and Kurds  from their homes In addition to Karabakh Armenian troops are controlling seven Azerbaijani administrative districts next to the breakaway enclaveThe upcoming summit will be the fifth between Armenian President Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev The two leaders met twice in 2004 and twice in 2005Commenting on the peace process last month the Minsk Group cochairs expressed confidence that the year 2006 would bring the two antagonists closer to a settlementAddressing reporters in Yerevan on 15 December 2005 after talks with Kocharian Frances Minsk Group envoy Bernard Fassier said he was hopeful the coming months could be a milestone We are convinced that next year there will be a real window of opportunity to achieve some significant progress toward a peaceful settlement of the dispute elaborated on the basis of what has been already worked out this yearWhile voicing optimism US representative Steven Mann that same day cautioned against too high expectations saying there was still a long road before achieving anything short of a peace agreement After our meeting with President Kocharian we believe as firmly as ever that events are moving in the right direction These are very tough negotiations and neither side has ever taken any position that I would characterize as soft Mann said But what you have to understand and what gives us hope as negotiators is that even though the sides are very toughminded in putting their positions forward we are seeing a desire on the part of each side to look towards an agreement But that doesnt mean it will be easyOskanian on 19 January expressed similar caution saying the talks he had in London with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov had reached their purpose which was to pave the way for a presidential summitNot A Draft AgreementThe Armenian foreign minister said both sides were still working on what he described as a non paper that intends to serve as a framework document for future talks It is not a draft agreement lets make that very clear This is a halfpage text where certain principles of the conflicts resolution have been articulated and this serves as a guideline for talks between the foreign ministers and also the presidents of both countries Once those principles will be agreed upon then they could serve as a basis for a more detailed document which eventually could serve as a guiding document for the resolution of the conflictOskanian further hinted that the sides were still far from a consensus on the basic principles of a peaceful settlement saying he hoped the two presidents would achieve progress on what he and Mammadyarov could not agree uponAzerbaijan has not yet commented on the outcome of the London meetingMammadyarov last month said the sides were working on nine basic principles including one that envisions the deployment of international peacekeepers in parallel with the gradual liberation of Azerbaijans occupied territoriesIn comments posted today on the DayAz news website President Aliyevs aide Novruz Mammadov said the deployment of peacekeepers could be decided only in the final stage of the negotiation processAs for the possibility of Karabakh residents holding a referendum on the political status of the enclave  an idea that resurfaced recently  Mammadov made it clear it could not happen before Armenian troops withdraw from the Azerbaijani territories that are currently under their controlAlso on Thursday Azerbaijans Defense Minister Safar Abiyev insisted that the international community force Armenia to liberate all occupied territories adding that failure to do so could lead to a resumption of military activitiesAzerbaijani officials have made similar comments in the past threatening to forcibly retake occupied territories Political experts

Turkish situation How serious is the situation Is H5N1 spreading rapidlyJuan Lubroth We only have confirmation on one outbreak in Turkey that we know is H5N1 and that is right across from the Armenian border The remaining outbreaks that we have confirmation on we know for them to be H5 but we do not know if they are all H5N1RFERL So the worst virus H5N1 is from the village near the Armenian border correctLubroth Thats correctRFERL Thats the only H5N1Lubroth that is confirmed Most likely the other viruses that we will identify and characterize from the other poultry outbreaks will also be H5N1 but we dont know that just yet We do know that what has been confirmed from the human cases is H5N1RFERL Is there any chance that there could be humantohuman transfer of the virus or not at this stageLubroth Perhaps that question would be best answered by someone from the WHO World Health Organization or the ECDC European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control However we have no evidence of humantohuman transmission at this stageYes I agree with my director that we would need good and transparent information from the neighboring countries from Turkey where we would be guaranteed that the disease is not there However we have heard for the past several months reports of high poultry deaths in some of those neighboring countries bordering Turkey In some cases it has been determined to be poisoning In other cases it has been determined to be other infectious diseases And that would need to be qualified and verified by some of the OIE World Organization for Animal Health and FAO reference laboratoriesRFERL What you are saying now is that you know there were some cases of dead poultry Is the Armenian government contacting you about these matters Are they trying to work through your organization Do you have any complaint against themLubroth We have been dealing with the veterinary services of Armenia in the past and we have some current projects Although we have projects in Armenia and a good relationship with their veterinary services we have not gotten specific reports regarding poultry and poultry health from themRFERL You know there are some reports that poultry is dying in some villages and they are testing in local laboratories in the capital city And they say there is no bird flu Is that the right way to proceedLubroth For us to tell that it is not bird flu it would be very important for us to know why these birds are dying and to prove to the international community that Armenia does not have H5 or H5N1 It is one thing to say it it is another thing to prove it We would welcome working more closely with the Armenian authorities to assist them to provide reliable diagnosis and even to offer the availability of OIE and FAO reference laboratories who have great experience in identifying the virus and characterizing the virusRFERL Can we say that you are not happy with the governments actionsLubroth No it is not that we are not happy We do do a lot of work with them on other animalhealth issues We just would like to be able to have perhaps better communication and sample sharing to the reference laboratories on a regular basis And there is a reporting obligation to the World Organization for Animal Health and those reports should be substantiated with quality diagnostics We do not know the level the capacity of the Armenian laboratory or other laboratories in the region to do that type of diagnosisRFERL There are some radio reports that in some villages just across the border in Armenia We sent our correspondent and the guy came back and said you know villagers are complaining that poultry is dying And they take them to the local laboratories and they say no it is some kind of plague or whatever Is that the right way to proceedLubroth No it is not the right way We would need to know if it is not avian influenza what is it And we do not know what it is Do you see There are many diseases that look like avian influenza One is caused by salmonella and it is called fowl cholera Now it could be fowl cholera and I would not doubt it if you show me the bacteria Now it could be Newcastle Disease another avian disease and I wouldnt doubt it Just show me the virus And I dont have that Im not getting that type of information So rather than to criticize the countries that we are trying to assist it would be better for us to be able to assist them and for us to have good communications with those countries We are preparing a WHO and FAO  together with the OIE  mission to Georgia Armenia Ukraine probably Syria in the next few days to be able to see what level of preparedness do these countries have on the human level at the veterinary level and to perhaps see are these laboratories able to characterize the virus or the bacteriaRFERL So you are sending your expertsLubroth We have to get country permission in order to do that and that is what we are working on with the WHORFERL Is there any problem there Getting permissionLubroth No weve just started organizing this yesterday and we are not at that stage yetAffected AreasClick on the map for a closer view of the areas within RFERLs broadcast region

presidencyinoffice Belgium made clear today that it will value compromise over confrontation among the 55 members of the organizationBelgian Foreign Minister Karel de Gucht said this applies in particular to the socalled frozen conflicts in Moldova and the CaucasusDe Gucht noted that in the context of each of these conflicts Russia plays a very important role Sometimes he said Russia is rather reluctant about the OSCE adding that it is the presidencys task to find solutions without provoking confrontationNo Tough Stance On RussiaHowever de Gucht specifically ruled out a tougher stance visavis Russia I dont think it is the role of the presidency of the OSCE to judge upon the positions of the parties concerned he said First of all it is the role of the presidency to try and find solutions for the frozen conflicts and especially for Transdniester and MoldovaAddressing Transdniester De Gucht said that it is not obvious how progress can be made He said Belgium does not want to provoke a political debate on the issue but sees its role in being a mediatorDe Gucht did criticize what he described as Chisinaus hardening position One of the complicating factors is the recent stance of Moldova on this which is in fact asking for a unitary state de Gucht said So to a certain extent they have been backtracking on this And thats what I mean that maybe we should try to find a solution to the military problems which is not necessarily linked to an immediate solution to the political problem itselfDe Gucht said Belgium will try to avoid what he called theoretical debates on Russias socalled Istanbul commitments This is a reference to an undertaking assumed by Moscow at the OSCEs 1999 Istanbul summit to remove its troops and munitions from Transdniester and Georgia by 2002 Russia has failed to meet that and subsequent deadlinesThe Belgian minister said today he is instead looking for practical solutions allowing for at least a partial removal of Russian forces from the breakaway regionDe Gucht noted that there are what he described as several kinds of troops in Transdniester Some Russian troops remain to guard military stockpiles Another Russian contingent complements a Ukrainian deployment watching over the unofficial truce between Chisinau and TiraspolDe Gucht said Russian troops would need to leave in several stages This could be followed by a political settlement He said that the ratification of the adapted Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty  which Russia is pushing for  is intimately linked to the resolution of the conflictDe Gucht said he has had extensive contacts with his Russian colleagues as well as with the Romanian and Ukrainian authorities He said he will visit the region at the first opportunitySouth OssetiaIn the Caucasus things perhaps look more hopefulDe Gucht said today that for the first time in years there are signs of an opening between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the dispute surrounding NagornoKarabakh I think we have a window of opportunity now because there have been elections in Azerbaijan there has also been a referendum in Armenia on a new constitution he said Windows of opportunity are important in politics and we have signs from several capitals that there might be a chance that we get to a solutionDe Gucht said he will visit the region on 2426 January to prepare ground for a meeting of the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents in FebruaryHe said there is hope that an in principle agreement could be reached at the meeting which could then be put into practice later in 2006De Gucht said that once consensus is reached the OSCE is prepared to send a force of observers or even peacekeepers to the regionTo deploy such a mission either by the way of observers or by the way of a force that will be positioned in between the parties that is of course a consensus that will have to be reached within the OSCE but I think that if the heads of state should come to an agreement the OSCE would also live up to its obligations de Gucht saidDe Gucht said participants for such missions would not be hard to find as the OSCE has been preparing its involvement for a very long timeDe Gucht said he also sees some positive signs in South Ossetia which won de facto independence from Georgia in the early 1990s Yes I think that there are serious prospects of coming to a solution for the problem and in that case we would also be willing to organize a donor conference for South Ossetia in the course of our presidencyThe Belgian foreign minister said he recently met both the Russian and Georgian foreign ministers and believes there is an opening there However he said he could not divulge any detailsLast month Georgia urged the EU to raise the issue in its contacts with Russia

same family in Dogubeyazit chickens continue to run freely in the backyards of a town in which an estimated 90 percent of households keep poultry Van Province in eastern Turkey is one of the poorest parts of the country and for many people here these birds are all they have to stave off hungerPanic is spreading with people at a loss to know what to doTurkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan has tried to assure both Turks and the international community that his government had the situation under control All the necessary measures that needed to be taken are being taken by the health and agriculture ministries he declared on 11 January We have organized a crisis center You must not pay attention to exaggerated statementsBut no amount of reassuring words can disguise the fact that there are now 14 confirmed cases in Turkey of humans infected by the virus and that many more cases are under investigation It has also spread beyond Van as far as the Black Sea coast and the capital Ankara Poultry deaths linked to bird flu have also been registered in IstanbulThe Alarm SoundsLittle wonder then that Turkeys neighbors are increasingly alarmed On 10 January Iran announced that it was closing a border crossing with Turkey and Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia have all banned the import of Turkish poultry Armenians feel particularly vulnerable as Dogubeyazit lies just a few kilometers from the borderGrigor Baghian head of Armenias State Veterinary Inspectorate says mandatory sanitary controls have been imposed at all border crossings We have instructed the relevant authorities to check the baggage of individuals coming from Turkey and to make sure that not a single chicken feather or egg is brought to Armenia he says Farmers in the impoverished settlements that dot the border fear that they could be next When dozens of chickens died in the village of Vosketap last week there was panicBut it subsided when the vets arrived Nvard Abrahamian 12 of whose chickens died says our vet inspected the dead chickens and concluded they were killed by another disease He then inoculated the remaining chickens and said we have nothing to worry about if they stay aliveAt the State Veterinary Inspectorate though Grigor Baghian is making no promises that Armenia is safe No cases of bird flu have been registered in Armenia to date The virus has not reached the republic but the situation in neighboring countries has put us in a highrisk zone he cautions That means outbreaks of the disease cannot be ruled out tomorrow the day after or after thatIn Georgia which also has a long border with Turkey the agriculture minister Mikheil Svimonishvili was at pains to assure people that so far there have been no outbreaks of bird flu in the countryIt was message repeated in Azerbaijan by the head of the state veterinary department Ismail Hasanov But he spoke of tough controls particularly in the Nakhichevan region which borders Turkey The veterinary service is working intensively on the borders We are following disinfection procedures we have prepared large stocks of disinfectants protective clothing special equipment and we have enough equipment to carry out disinfection measures he saidEurope Bans Poultry ImportsNone of which was enough to stop the European Commission announcing on 11 January that it was banning the import of poultry and feathers from all six states bordering eastern Turkey Georgia Armenia Azerbaijan Syria Iran and Iraq Russia too said it was tightening control of its borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan while its chief medical officer Gennadii Onishchenko said it might be necessary to impose a temporary travel ban to Turkey if the situation there continued to deteriorate In the meantime he urged Russians not to visit Turkey Why does this worry us First of all because of its immediate proximity to our borders and secondly because in January there will be an increase in ordinary human flu and viewed against this background there is a danger that we will not detect the spread onto our territory of this particular H5N1 type of flu Russia has no immediate borders with TurkeyAs the H5N1 strain of bird flu continues its seemingly inexorable global advance doctors are calling for calm There is still no evidence they say that avian flu is spreading between people All confirmed cases in Turkey were caused by direct contact with birdsRFERLs Azeri Armenian and Russian Services contributed to this reportInterview With UN FAOs Erwin NorthoffAn expert at the National Virology Laboratory of the Kyrgyz Health Ministry

dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over NagornoKarabakh saw little movement in 2005 The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE Minsk Group has sought since 1992 to mediate a settlement to that conflict The group met on four occasions in January April June and December with the two countries foreign ministers Vartan Oskanian Armenia and Elmar Mammadyarov Azerbaijan Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev met in Warsaw in May and Kazan in August to discuss points on which the foreign ministers had reportedly reached provisional agreement  NagornoKarabakh an exclave within Azerbaijan is predominantly ethnic Armenian The local Armenian population asked the Soviet leadership in February 1988 to transfer the region to Armenia triggering an exodus of the Azerbaijani population  Following the unilateral 1991 declaration of NagornoKarabakhs independence from Azerbaijan hitherto sporadic fighting escalated into a fullfledged war in which Armenian forces took control of swathes of neighboring Azerbaijani territory The three sides  Armenia Azerbaijan and the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic  signed a ceasefire agreement in May 1994 The exact details of this years talks have been unclear despite leaks and subsequent denials The most contentious issues are the final status of the NagornoKarabakh Republic the timeframe for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the regions of Azerbaijan bordering the republic and in the event of a troop withdrawal what countries or organizations could provide peacekeepers to be deployed on those territories  The Minsk Group has repeatedly warned that any peace agreement will inevitably require major concessions from both countries However with parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan in November the Baku authorities were understandably reluctant to agree to any concessions  Neither side is slowing down on defense spending either  Azerbaijani President Aliyev has stressed repeatedly that Baku reserves the right to resort to military force if it proves impossible to reach a negotiated end to the conflict On Army Day 25 June he told military cadets that Azerbaijans defense spending had increased from 175 million in 2004 to 300 million in 2005 And meeting in early September with residents of Lenkoran in southeastern Azerbaijan he announced that defense spending would double in 2006 to 600 million Yerevan was apparently neither intimidated nor impressed by such threats Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian commented in October that the Azerbaijani leadership gives the impression of being drunk on petrodollars But Armenia has nonetheless factored an increase in defense spending into its budget for 2006 With the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan over and no national election due next year in either Armenia or Azerbaijan mediators are more optimistic at the prospects for a Karabakh peace settlement in 2006 South Ossetia The impasse in Georgias breakaway republic of South Ossetia has also continued The region is widely regarded as a hotbed of smuggling and other criminal activities Currently Russia Georgia and North and South Ossetia jointly police the conflict zone under the aegis of the OSCE On 29 September the region erupted into violence when unidentified perpetrators subjected the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali to mortar fire from a neighboring Georgianpopulated village injuring 10 people Georgia in 2005 unveiled three successive revisions in January August and October of the peace plan for South Ossetia that Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili first presented to the UN General Assembly in September 2004 But the leadership of the unrecognized Republic of South Ossetia rejected all three overtures Tbilisi is now seeking to secure a greater role for the international community which has expressed support for Saakashvilis peace proposals in monitoring the situation in the South Ossetia Tbilisi has accused the Russian peacekeepers deployed there of turning a blind eye to abductions and arms and drug smuggling Moscow and the South Ossetian leadership however have rejected Georgias proposal to include the United States and European Union into the existing peacekeeping arrangement While Saakashvili has concentrated his diplomatic offensive primarily on forcing a solution to the South Ossetian conflict it has been left largely to the United Nations to continue the search for a solution to the Abkhaz conflict The Abkhaz minority on Georgias Black Sea coast complained for decades of discrimination at the hands of the Georgians who sent troops into the region in August 1992 triggering a war in which Russia backed the Abkhaz After 13 months of fighting the Georgian military retreated and most nonAbkhaz including some 250000 Georgians fled Abkhazia In August the UN mediated talks in Sukhum between Georgian and Abkhaz government officials on security issues for the nonresumption of activities and confidencebuilding measures in the conflict zone Sergei Bagapsh who was elected Abkhaz president in a repeat election in January has sent mixed signals He has repeatedly stressed that Abkhazias selfproclaimed but unrecognized independence is not negotiable And he has said he regards Russia as Abkhazias key ally and partner  At the same time Bagapsh has signaled a more pragmatic and conciliatory approach to economic cooperation with Georgia He has also seemed willing to put in place security measures that would expedite and facilitate the return to Abkhazias southernmost Gali Raion of the Georgians who fled the district during the war In recent weeks however Bagapsh has toughened his position insisting that Georgians who return to live permanently in Gali must adopt Abkhaz citizenship Most observers attribute the periodic hardening in the positions of the South Ossetian and Abkhaz leadership to pressure from Moscow on which Bagapsh in particular depends for support in the face of increasing pressure from the Abkhaz opposition  Moscow will almost certainly continue to use Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2006 to exert pressure on Georgia in retaliation for Georgias highprofile campaign to secure a formal invitation possibly as early as 2006 to join NATO And despite having assured NATO that it would slim down its armed forces Georgia is reportedly engaged in a massive military buildup Unconfirmed reports suggest Defense Minister Irakli Okruashvili has ordered the acquisition of primarily offensive weapons such as battle tanks along with tens of thousands of machine guns to arm reservists  Prigorodnyi Raion Another conflict in the region grabs fewer headlines but is similarly caught in a state of deadlock There are few prospects for resolving the simmering dispute between Ingushetia and the Republic of North Ossetia over Prigorodnyi Raion  The raion was transferred from Ingushetia to North Ossetia in the wake of the 1944 deportation to Central Asia of the entire Ingush people Thousands of Ingush who returned to their former homes in the late 1950s fled Prigorodnyi Raion for Ingushetia in November 1992 during bloody fighting between the two ethnic groups Most do not dare go back as those families who have done so are subject to constant harassment Moscow is currently preoccupied by the escalation of violence in other parts of the North Caucasus most recently in KabardinoBalkaria in October And the embattled Ingush opposition is increasingly reluctant to make an issue of the republican leaderships disinclination to make its case more forcefully with the Russian leadership lest Ingushetian President Murat Zyazikov seize on that criticism as a pretext for further reprisals Eyes On Kosovo How far separatist leaders and groups choose to push their agendas in 2006 could depend on Serbia and Montenegros province of Kosovo Talks could be held on the disputed province in early 2006 Neither the Armenian nor the Karabakh leadership is likely to settle for less than independent status for Karabakh unless or until a final decision is made denying Kosovo independence  If Kosovo does finally win independence NagornoKarabakh Abkhazia and South Ossetia are likely to adduce that victory as setting a precedent that should also be applied to them  regardless of the very real differences between those conflictsRFERL Caucasus Report    SUBSCRIBE For weekly news and indepth analysis on Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia and Russias North Caucasus by email subscribe to RFERL Caucasus Report

transform Yerevans Opera Square into an arena of freedom Hovanissian said I invite all citizens of the Republic of Armenia to take part in a civilassembly initiative that on November 27th will become a powerful national demonstration Yet the opposition finds itself out on a limb The European Union the Council of Europe and the United States have described the proposed changes to the constitution as vital to the process of reform Yesterday the president of the Council of Europes Parliamentary Assembly Rene van der Linden effectively threw his weight against the opposition by urging all voters to participate It was he said an opportunity for Armenians to show their commitment to Europe Failure of the referendum due to a low turnout would be a major setback for Armenias progress in fulfilling some of the most important commitments the country made when joining the Council of Europe The Venice Commission which advises the Council of Europe on constitutional law gave its support to the package of constitutional amendments contained in the referendum in July after the Armenian authorities accepted most of its recommendations On paper at least the changes would transfer many powers from the president to the parliament the Cabinet of Ministers and the judiciary They would also strengthen respect for human rights But Aghas Yenokyan an independent political analyst in Yerevan explains that the opposition has lost faith in the democratic process in Armenia The laws on the constitution are not very important thing for the reality in Armenia Yenokian said The opposition doesnt believe much in the changes that would occur during the democratic process They know that there is just one way  and actually they were encouraged by our neighbors in CIS countries Eds a reference to the Rose Revolution in Georgia  to change the current situation which is the exertion of pressure by the public by demonstrations In reality though the biggest obstacle facing the safe passage of the amendments is not so much the opposition boycott as popular apathy At least onethird of the total electorate must vote in its favor  and more than 50 percent of those who actually vote It could be a tall order at least according to recent opinion polls which suggest there will be a low turnout President Robert Kocharian needs to overcome both voter indifference and ignorance of the constitution This week he stepped up his campaign to win support We have quite a large quantity of printed copies of the draft which we will try to deliver to every single family in Armenia so that out public gets the chance to draw its own conclusions not just from commentary but directly for itself Kocharian said His supporters say they are confident Galust Sahakian who is a senior member of the ruling coalition is predicting an overwhelming victory in the poll Judging by the meetings I have had with people as well as what my own intuition and analysis tell me Id say it will be about 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of a yes vote Sahakian said It is claims like that though that convince both opposition supporters and neutrals alike that the government has no intention of ensuring a free and fair referendum Their confidence is further undermined by the virtual absence of foreign observers The Council of Europe is sending just seven while the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which had more than 600 observers at the recent parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan is not deploying any for the Armenian referendum because it has had no formal invitation from the authorities  The odds are stacked it seems against the opposition Its position enjoys no international support it has had limited access to media in Armenia to explain its case and just like the government it has to overcome popular apathy Political analyst Aghas Yenokian is dismissive of the oppositions chances I think the opposition will not succeed they will fail they cannot make a really big demonstration Yenokian said Kocharian will go to cheat the results because  as far as I can understand the situation in Armenia  people just dont care about the constitutional changes So where will the referendum leave Armenia Failure would deliver a remarkable blow to the prestige of Robert Kocharian and his government But it would also leave the country with a constitution that is widely regarded as seriously flawed In Armenia though few doubt the published results will reveal a government triumph Whether or not the amendments will change anything for the better is another

https://www.rferl.org/a/1063206.html,Armenia 10 Questions About The Constitutional Amendments ,"November 21, 2005 14:48 GMT",,In Place Of A Forward  Why have constitutional reforms become necessary at this particular time and how will these reforms impact on relations with the diaspora and on our countrys authority within the international community The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia that was adopted in 1995 has fulfilled its primary purpose On the foundation of that constitution were laid the economic social and political structures of the independent Republic of Armenia The constitution allowed us to avoid numerous political upheavals and to overcome a crisis of power But there are no constitutions set in stone Civic life is developing and the need to perfect the mechanisms of the constitutional system has arisen so that those mechanisms can remain the moving force of development The constitutional amendments are called upon to create a balance between the legislative executive and judicial branches of power to secure their independence and to review the dominant role in regard to them of the president of the republic This will strengthen the democratic foundations for the development of the country and strengthen the real guarantees of the individual and the citizen No one will be able to place himself above the law It is extremely important to abolish the ban on dual citizenship This most important question must be resolved in accordance with the law a process that will allow us to implement a more flexible policy in this area and to involve our conationals from the diaspora in the life of the country All this will give Armenia the possibility of taking its place before the international community as a democratic state and will help to integrate Armenia into various international structures As a result political economic and legal reforms will be implemented the importance of which for both the present and for future generations is difficult to overestimate It is likewise of note that the draft law on amending the constitution was approved by the Council of Europes Venice Commission Consequently adopting that draft by means of a referendum will be an important step on the road toward the integration of our country into the civilized world and it will contribute toward raising its international authority The aim of this brochure is to inform voters in an accessible and simple way about the basic provisions envisioned by the draft law on amending and amplifying the constitution 1 What new possibilities do the proposed constitutional changes create for the development of the individual The draft law on amending and amplifying the constitution envisages incorporating into the constitution a series of new human and civil rights expanding those rights and freedoms enshrined in the existing constitution and adding to it new obligations on the part of the state aimed at respecting and guaranteeing human rights and freedoms All these changes serve one purpose to strengthen the real position of persons and of citizens of the Republic of Armenia and in doing so to promote the free development of the individual So it is planned to augment the package of human and civil rights by including in addition the right of each person to address statements or proposals  with the aim of defending his personal or societys interests  to the competent state organs organs of local government and to specific officials and to receive an appropriate response within a reasonable time period Article 271 the right to defend the interests of the consumer Article 332 and the right to live in a healthy environment Article 332 No less important is the provision according to which forced labor is banned in the Republic of Armenia and children under the age of 16 may not be permanently employed Article 32 It is proposed to redesignate as human rights a series of rights that are qualified as civil rights in the existing constitution This affects the following rights the right to freedom of movement Article 25 to conduct peaceful unarmed assemblies meetings marches and demonstrations Article 25 to the free choice of work Article 32 to a satisfactory standard of living for ones family Article 34 to social security in old age or in the event of disability illness or other circumstances Article 37 and the right to education Article 39 Of exceptionally important significance are the changes it is proposed to introduce to Articles 14 and 42 of the constitution The amendments to Article 14 oblige the state to respect and defend human dignity as part of the indivisible basis of human rights and freedoms According to the proposed amendment to Article 42 restrictions on human and civil rights and freedoms may not exceed the limitations imposed by the international obligations of the Republic of Armenia 2 In democratic states particular importance is attached to the existence of effective legal mechanisms for defending human rights and freedoms What will change in this regard if the constitutional amendments are adopted There are numerous known cases in which the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the constitution were a mere formality and existed only on paper insofar as effective legal mechanisms were not prescribed to defend them Cogent proof of this is the human and civil rights and freedoms enshrined in the Sovietera constitutions It should be noted that the legal mechanisms for defending human and civil rights and freedoms that are written into the existing constitution are to be augmented by three new provisions the effectiveness of which has been demonstrated by the experience of foreign countriesa In line with the proposed change to Article 18 in order to defend his rights and freedoms everyone is entitled in accordance with the legally established procedure to receive the assistance of a humanrights ombudsman International experience shows that this institution of humanrights ombudsman is an effective means of defending human rights and freedoms It was therefore appropriate that after World War II it was introduced in the constitutions of numerous countriesb Another amendment to the same article of the constitution envisages the right of every person in accordance with international agreements to which the Republic of Armenia is a signatory to appeal to international organs for the defense of his rights and freedoms The use of that possibility will doubtless contribute to bringing our existing legal mechanisms for defending human rights and freedoms into compliance with international  in the first instance European  values principles and normsc Under the amendment to Article 101 any person may appeal to the Constitutional Court in connection with a specific case in which there is a final legal ruling when all other means of legal defense have been exhausted and when the constitutionality of the provision of the law applied by that legal ruling is questioned The need for this change is dictated by the fact that in specific cases the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the constitution are circumscribed or infringed upon by the law currently in force If this amendment is adopted every citizen will be able to challenge in the Constitutional Court the constitutionality of such laws or of their individual provisions 3 What is the essence of the restrictions imposed on the presidential powers and what is the rationale for them In a semipresidential system the president is in a position to seek to maintain a balance and to safeguard the normal functioning of the legislative executive and judicial branches only if he has the constitutionally guaranteed possibility of exerting influence on the activities of all three branches of power At the same time it is clear that the president may not deprive the branches of power of the possibility of acting independently and from this angle the amendments are intended to substantially limit the powers of the president of the republic in his relations with the legislative executive and judicial branches In the relations between the president and the parliament it is envisaged to abolish the exclusive right of the president of the republic to dissolve the National Assembly In addition it is the position of the parliament not that of the president that is decisive when it comes to forming the government It is envisaged to transfer to the National Assembly other aspects of the powers of the president of the republic Thus under the present constitution it is the president who appoints and dismisses the prosecutorgeneral at the proposal of the prime minister whereas the constitutional amendments envisage that the National Assembly will appoint the prosecutorgeneral at the proposal of the president of the republic Article 103 One more example under the existing constitution the president can convene an emergency session of the National Assembly while after the amendments have been passed that right will devolve on the chairman of the National Assembly Article 70 In line with the constitutional amendments the president will not establish the structure of the government or monitor the decisions of the government and he will no longer head the Council of Justice 4 How will the changes affect the interaction between the president and the government Significant limitations will be imposed on the powers of the president with regard to the formation and activities of the government If according to the existing constitution the president of the republic can appoint and dismiss the prime minister at his discretion the amendments envisage that on the basis of the distribution of deputies mandates and consultations with parliamentary factions the president appoints as prime minister a person who enjoys the trust of the majority of deputies Article 554 In other words it is the opinion of the National Assembly not that of the president that is crucial in appointing the prime minister It is planned to abolish the presidents right to dismiss the prime minister  It should be noted that under the existing constitution the president of the republic is not only the head of state but in fact also heads the government At the prime ministers suggestion the president of the republic determines the structure and priorities of the government convenes and chairs its sessions the prime minister may convene and chair a government session only at the behest of the president and he monitors the decisions of the government  In line with the amendments the structure of the government will be determined by law Article 85 From now on government sessions will be convened and chaired by the prime minister The decisions of the government will have legal force without being signed by the president of the republic The president may only suspend implementation of government decisions for one month and ask the Constitutional Court to rule on whether they comply with the constitution Article 86 These amendments have one single purpose  to form an independently functioning government that is answerable to the National Assembly not to the president of the republic 5 How will the role of the parliament be strengthened after these changes If under the existing constitution the dominant role in the system of political and legal institutions belonged to the president then in line with these amendments it is the parliament that will receive the dominant role in that interaction Thus if the opinions of the president and the parliament majority on the question of forming the government and appointing the prime minister do not coincide then it is the opinion of the parliament that proves decisive because Point 4 of Article 55 stipulates clearly that the president is obliged to appoint that candidate who enjoys the trust of the parliamentary majority The president will no longer have the exclusive right to dissolve the National Assembly The parliament will appoint the prosecutorgeneral the chairman of the Audit Chamber and the chairman of the Central Bank and it will select the human rights ombudsman  If according to the existing constitution the government is answerable to the president of the republic in accordance with the changes the government will be answerable solely to the parliament In contrast to the current procedure for requiring members of the government to respond to parliaments questions parliament will receive the right to adopt decisions on the basis of those responses including a vote of no confidence in the government One could cite numerous other examples but these are sufficient for it to become clear that in accordance with the constitutional amendments Armenia will move from the model of strong presidential power toward a parliamentary republic 6 Why are the provisions on presidential immunity written into the constitution and what will the legal consequences of those provisions be We are not talking about total immunity for the president but for immunity for those actions that result from his formal status The powers of the president of the republic are exhaustively defined by the constitution It is these powers that limit the immunity of the president  because after expiry of his term the president can be brought to justice for actions that are not connected with his formal status Article 561 Part 2 In addition the president of the republic can be removed from office for treason and other grave crimes regardless of whether his criminal actions are connected with his official position He can also be brought to trial after his removal from office There are similar provisions with regard to presidential immunity in the constitutions of other states including Romania Article 95 Bulgaria Article 102 Lithuania Article 86 Poland Article 145 and others The purpose of this is to protect the president of the republic from politically motivated criminal prosecution 7 Society has always been harshly critical of the legal system What amendments are to be made to the constitution with regard to the courts in order to improve peoples trust in the legal system Improving the work of the courts is a complex problem that requires the implementation of economic social organizational and educational measures In present conditions particular attention is paid to ensuring the independence of courts and judges This is the basic aim of the proposed constitutional amendments Under the existing constitution the president of the republic is chairman of the Council of Justice and the justice minister and the prosecutorgeneral serve as deputy chairmen Essentially by means of the Council of Justice the president oversees the appointment of judges and assigns specific questions to them If the constitutional amendments are adopted it is the chairman of the Appeals Court who will chair sessions of the Council of Justice although he will not have voting rights This will significantly reduce the possibilities for the president of the republic and representatives of the executive to influence decisions made by the Council of Justice which will in fact become something like an organ of selfgovernment for judges  The role of the Appeals Court in the legal system will change drastically According to the proposed amendment to Article 92 the Appeals Court is called upon to ensure the uniform application of the law The aim of the proposed amendment is to limit the scope for judges to interpret the law arbitrarily and hand down arbitrary judgments to exclude the possibility of judges handing down diverging rulings and verdicts in identical cases The proposed amendment to Article 18 of the constitution will also serve to improve the work of the courts In accordance with the international obligations of the Republic of Armenia that amendment gives everyone the right to appeal to international organs to defend his human rights and freedoms We have already touched on that We will add only that the practical implementation of that provision will provide for the real influence of international legal organs on the functioning of the Armenian legal system and will help to ensure that the work of our courts corresponds to international criteria and norms 8 What changes are to be introduced into the procedure of forming and the activities of other institutions of state power There are quite a large number of such changes The humanrights defender ombudsman acquires constitutional status Article 821 as does the National Commission for Television and Radio Article 832 Those institutions were created and they currently function on the basis of the law But international practice shows that the work of those institutions is more productive when the procedure for their formation and functioning and the guarantees of their independence are written into the constitution Also envisaged is a partial shifting of powers from the president to the National Assembly in connection with the formation of those institutions Thus if under the existing law it is the president of the republic who appoints the humanrights ombudsman the constitutional amendments envision that in future it is the parliament that will do so At present the president of the republic appoints all the members of the National Commission for Television and Radio If the constitutional amendments are approved he will appoint half the members of that commission and the National Assembly will appoint the other half  The constitutional amendments also envisage the creation of a Control Chamber whose chairman the National Assembly will appoint This will be an independent institution that will not answer either to the president of the republic or to the National Assembly or to the government It will be called upon to monitor the use of budget funds and also of state and public property 9 Some changes are also envisaged in the relations between the national government and local governments What is the nature of and the rationale for those changes Fundamental changes are envisaged in this sphere Their basic goal is to strengthen local selfgovernment and to increase significantly the independence of local organs of government Changes are envisaged to a number of different aspects of the work of those institutions One set of changes is aimed at strengthening the economic foundations of local government The following provisions are intended to serve that purpose a land that is part of the administrative territory of a community  except for land that is essential to state needs and land that is the property of individuals or legal entities  belongs to the community Article 1051 b the communitys sources of finance should be sufficient to enable it to exercise its powers Article 106 c the powers delegated by the state to the community must be financed from the state budget Article 196 These new provisions are intended to guarantee the financial independence of organs of local selfgovernment from the organs of state power The terms for which local governments are elected is increased from three years to four It is envisaged that community heads should participate directly in local government and try to resolve questions by means of a local referendum The process by which the government may remove a local community head is made more complicated In contrast to the existing constitution the amendments envisage that in circumstances laid down by law the government may remove a local community head from office only on the basis of a ruling by the Constitutional Court Article 109 The existing constitutional restriction that sets at 15 the maximum number of members of a council of elders has been abolished  which means the number of members of such councils can be increased 10 What status will Yerevan have after the adoption of the constitutional amendments Under the existing constitution Yerevan has the status of a province The internal contradiction here is clear If the amendments are adopted Yerevan will acquire the natural status that of a community Article 108 This means that the capital will have its own budget and will be able to draw on its own funds to solve problems that affect the whole city The city will have an elected mayor who will answer in the first instance to the population This will make the mayor of the capital independent of the organs of state power to a certain degree The city will have a representative body that will endorse the draft city budget and monitor budget spending and the activities of the mayor Respected fellow countrymen and women We hope that this brochure will help to give you a more precise understanding of the constitutional changes The time for you to choose is approaching Make up your mind take part in the 27 November national referendum and make the correct choice Translation by Liz Fuller

to reform the countrys basic law The opposition is therefore urging voters to boycott the referendum the outcome of which they accuse the leadership of planning to falsify The process of drafting the amendments and their passage by parliament has been protracted and acrimonious It has moreover been overshadowed by the failure of a previous constitutional referendum two years ago On that occasion just over 52 percent of registered voters participated with yes votes only narrowly exceeding no votes RFERLs Armenian Service reported on 28 May 2003 In September 2004 three separate draft packages of proposed amendments were submitted to the Armenian parliament prepared respectively by the ruling threeparty coalition the progovernment United Labor Party and veteran oppositionist Arshak Sadoyan leader of the National Democratic Party Those three drafts were then submitted for evaluation to the Council of Europes Venice Commission which assessed the first two as an improvement on the present constitution but the Venice Commission rejected Sadoyans as failing to address certain crucial issues related to human rights and the judiciary according to Noyan Tapan on 22 December The commission further suggested a number of changes to the government draft specifically with regard to expanding the powers of the legislature limiting the presidents authority to appoint and dismiss judges and introducing elections for the post of Yerevan mayor In early May the Armenian parliament approved a slightly revised version of the draft prepared by the ruling coalition Sadoyan promptly denounced that draft as evil and warned that it could lead to an Asianstyle dictatorship according to Noyan Tapan on 13 May He called on all political forces to reject that draft In seemingly partial agreement the Council of Europes Venice Commission expressed in late May its deep dissatisfaction at the authorities failure to take into account its previous recommendations see RFERL Newsline 1 June 2005 That negative assessment prompted the two opposition parliamentary factions  the Artarutiun bloc and the National Accord Party AMK  to advise their members to reject the proposed changes RFERLs Armenian Service reported on 31 May In late June Armenia submitted to the Venice Commission an amended draft that addressed the commissions three main concerns The commission approved the revised draft on 21 July but opposition parties nonetheless continued to demand further changes and boycotted the subsequent parliament debates in August and September at which the final draft was approved Yet despite their shared disapproval of the draft amendments and apprehension that the government would resort to subterfuge to ensure their approval by the population at large the opposition initially failed to agree on a course of action Even during the emergency debate in late August in which the draft was approved in its first and second readings Artarutiun and the AMK announced that they rejected the draft and would urge voters to vote against them RFERLs Armenian Service reported Days later they announced plans to stage rallies across the country in an attempt to persuade voters to reject the proposed changes But on 16 November just 11 days before the referendum most opposition parties shifted tactics and decided to urge voters to boycott Opposition leaders first and foremost former Prime Minister and Hanrapetutiun party Chairman Aram Sargsian repeatedly accused the authorities of seeking to falsify the outcome of the plebiscite and warned that attempts to do so would trigger a spontaneous uprising and the collapse of the regime We will be living in a new Armenia on 28 November Sargsian declared on 11 November in the town of Yeghard The Armenian authorities too launched an intensive publicrelations campaign to drum up support for the proposed constitutional amendments for which 21 political parties plus the Peoples Deputy parliamentary faction expressed their backing in an 18 October statement Noyan Tapan reported Some aspects of that campaign such as orders issued to teachers in Yerevan by the city mayor to persuade students and their parents of the merits of the planned changes have fueled opposition suspicions that the authorities plan to rig the outcome of the vote And while television stations are not charging for governmentsponsored advertising promoting the constitutional changes the opposition has encountered problems in securing paid airtime to argue its case against RFERLs Armenian Service reported on 31 October  While Armenian officials are unanimous in insisting that the voting will be free and fair and that they will not resort to rigging to obtain the required minimum number of votes in favor of the proposed changes differences of opinion have emerged within the ruling coalition over the likely impact of failure Prime Minister Andranik Markarian said on 6 October that speculation that the failure of the referendum would necessitate the governments resignation is misplaced Noyan Tapan reported Galust Sahakian who heads the parliamentary faction of Markarians Republican Party of Armenia HHK suggested that it would be better for the draft not to pass than for it to be pushed through by means of violations But Armen Rustamian of the Armenian Revolutionary FederationDashnaktsutiun argued on 22 September that failure to pass the amendments would mean failure for Armenia insofar as it would he suggested be construed by the European Union and the Council of Europe as a rejection of Europe and of European values RFERLs Armenian Service reported In a 28 October address to students at Yerevan State University that was subsequently posted in English translation on the Foreign Ministrys website httpwwwarmeniaforeignministryam Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian sought to demolish the oppositions arguments against the proposed changes and the myths that he said have grown up around some of them Oskanian dismissed as excuses with no underpinnings the argument that the present Armenian leadership does not have the right to reform the constitution because it was not legitimately elected and has repeatedly violated it He further dismissed as myths claims that the revised constitution would make it possible for the parliament to endorse changes in the countrys borders without the issue being put to a nationwide referendum would give noncitizens the chance to buy unlimited quantities of land in Armenia would make it possible by removing the existing ban on dual citizenship for Diaspora Armenians to play the decisive role in running the country and would grant the incumbent president immunity from prosecution and lift the existing ban on a president serving more than two consecutive terms President Robert Kocharians second term in office expires in early 2008 Senior HHK lawmaker Samvel Nikoyan reminded voters in Armenias northwestern Shirak district on 17 November while seeking to persuade the population to endorse the proposed constitutional changes that Kocharian has repeatedly vowed that he will not seek a third term All the political forces that have backed the president until now are of the opinion that the constitution must be respected and that no president should have the right to be reelected for a third term Nikoyan said Kocharians national security adviser Garnik Isagulian affirmed on 16 November I can say for certain that we will get a yes vote We will get more votes than are required by law RFERLs Armenian Service reported HHK faction head Sahakian predicted on 18 November that the ratio of yes to no votes will be 8020 Noyan Tapan reported AMK Chairman Artashes Geghamian proclaimed with similar confidence on 16 November that the constitutional changes are doomed to be rejected by our people That is obvious to all of us According to an opinion poll conducted by the Vox Populi center in Yerevan in early November and summarized on 18 November by Noyan Tapan 54 percent of respondents intend to participate in the referendum of whom 466 percent said they will vote yes Whether that comparatively low level of support is due to deeprooted discontent with the present leadership remains unclear Equally unclear is what percentage of voters have a clear understanding of the changes they are being asked to approve especially as voters are required to say yes or no to the entire package rather than to vote on individual changes or as was the case in the 2002 Azerbaijani constitutional referendum on groups of proposed amendments That referendum entailed approving or rejecting eight distinct packages of changes relating to such issues as the conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections the conduct of referendums the

https://www.rferl.org/a/1061130.html,Azerbaijan From Showmanship To Brinkmanship ,"September 02, 2005 14:39 GMT",,On the one hand they are under pressure from the Council of Europe the OSCE and the United States to avoid the egregious violations and outright falsification that marred the elections of 1995 1998 2000 and 2003 and to deliver on their repeated pledges that this time around the vote will be transparent free and fair And on the other hand they need to secure a comfortable parliamentary majority for the ruling Yeni Azerbaycan Party without sparking postelections protests on the lines of those that over the past two years have toppled entrenched regimes in Georgia Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan The tactics and strategy selected to achieve that objective appear to contain elements of both showmanship and brinkmanship ShowmanshipOn 11 May President Ilham Aliyev issued a decree outlining measures to improve the conduct of elections The preamble to that decree admitted that contrary to the political will of the Azerbaijani authorities previous elections were marred by illegalities but it blamed those irregularities on the lack of professionalism and postSoviet mentality of individual local officials and election commission members No effort has been made over the past two years to identify the individuals responsible for those irregularities and bring them to justice The first of 11 measures listed in President Aliyevs decree and intended to prevent a recurrence of procedural violations entailed programs to raise the professionalism and competence of the officials responsible for the organization of the election process and the vote count the second was a warning to those officials that they will be held legally responsible for any infringements of the Election Law such as hampering electioneering by opposition candidates or intervening in the voting process or vote count The Azerbaijani leadership is thus apparently seeking to offload in advance the blame for possible violations on to regional officials who will have to calculate which offense will be perceived as greater failing to ensure at all costs the victory of the ruling partys candidate or risking their superiors opprobrium should international observers register and publicly condemn malpractice in voting stations under their jurisdictionA third provision of President Aliyevs decree ostensibly intended to contribute to the fairness of the election process is the provision for the conduct of exit polls Paradoxically however this provision could have the opposite effect if voters in rural areas fearful of the wrath of the local authorities claim to have voted for the YAP candidate when in fact they cast their votes for a member of the opposition A glaring discrepancy between the actual division of ballots cast and the exitpoll results could impel local election commission members to bring the official tally into line with the inaccurate exitpoll data Further aspects of the election campaign to date that could be construed as manifestations of showmanship include the lifting of longstanding restrictions on holding opposition demonstrations in Baku registration of several controversial opposition candidates first and foremost former parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliev the MSKs 12 August appeal to the Armenian population of the breakaway unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic to register to elect a candidate to represent the enclave in the next Azerbaijani parliament and the belated launch on 29 August of a nominally independent public television station whose mandate requires it to provide equal access to both progovernment and opposition parliamentary candidates On the same day as the MSK announced Gulievs registration the office of Azerbaijans prosecutorgeneral declared that it has stripped Guliev of his immunity from prosecution Should he return to Baku from the United States as he has pledged to do he consequently risks arrest on charges of largescale embezzlement Following the 11 May presidential decree in late June under pressure from the international community Azerbaijans parliament adopted 43 amendments proposed by President Aliyev to the existing election law Those amendments did not however include the most important changes called for by the Council of Europes Venice Commission nor did they increase opposition representation on election commissions at all levels as the opposition had demanded The opposition demanded equal representation on election commissions which the authorities rejected accusing the opposition of thus seeking to prevent such commissions from adopting any decisions Presidentialadministration head Ramiiz Mekhtiev told dayaz on 23 July that the oppositions objective in demanding equal representation was the desire to be in a position to paralyze the functioning of election commissions and thus sabotage the entire election process The Council of Europe called for appointing an additional opposition representative to the MSK to give a total of seven opposition and nine progovernment members And BrinkmanshipThe presidential administration appears to regard the combined provisions of the presidential decree and the amended election law as a panacea against election fraud  provided lowerlevel bureaucrats abide by its provisions Proceeding from that conviction the Azerbaijani leadership has apparently switched from showmanship to brinkmanship arguing that additional measures to preclude fraud are unnecessary For example Ali Hasanov who heads the political department within the presidential administration told dayaz on 1 September that the authorities do not consider it necessary to accede to the proposal made most recently during a visit to Baku late last month by Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE Chairman Rene van der Linden to mark voters fingers with indelible ink to prevent multiple voting Further uglier manifestations of brinkmanship include the recourse for the first time in an Azerbaijani election to doubles meaning the nomination in a given constituency of additional candidates with the same name as a prominent oppositionist The first target for such confusion is former presidential adviser Edar Namazov one of the leaders of the opposition alliance Yeni Siyaset who will compete against two namesakes in a Baku constituency The questionable allegations of collusion with Armenian special services brought by the ProsecutorGenerals Office against Ruslan Bashirli chairman of the opposition youth movement Yeni Fikir fall into the same category Allegations of treason by association were subsequently brought against Bashirlis mentor Ali Kerimli chairman of the progressive wing of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party one of three opposition parties aligned in the Azadlyg bloc Some observers have construed the vilification campaign launched against Kerimli as an attempt to split Azadlyg by creating the impression that the authorities consider Kerimli rather than fellow Azadlyg leader and Musavat party Chairman Isa Gambar who lost to President Aliyev in the October 2003 presidential ballot as the most popular and influential candidate and by extension as a threat to be neutralized The final list of candidates is to be announced on 7 September manifestations of both brinkmanship and black PR are likely to multiply in the two months remaining before the election

long that new union would last Shortly after its first anniversary in January 1993 US expert Paul Goble memorably dubbed the CIS the worlds largest fig leaf alluding to the need to conceal the final collapse of Moscows influence over the country it had controlled since the USSR was first created in 1922 ,The ink was barely dry on those signatures when skeptics began questioning how long that new union would last Shortly after its first anniversary in January 1993 US expert Paul Goble memorably dubbed the CIS the worlds largest fig leaf alluding to the need to conceal the final collapse of Moscows influence over the country it had controlled since the USSR was first created in 1922 Russian politicians however including President Vladimir Putin have tended to put a positive spin on the emergence of the CIS as a mechanism for ensuring a civilized divorce in other words for enabling the various former Soviet Socialist Republics to agree without bloodshed to go their separate waysInitially every effort was made to preserve cooperation between CIS member states at a level close to that which existed within the USSR In May 1992 six CIS member states Armenia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Russia Tajikistan and Uzbekistan signed the CIS Collective Security Treaty pledging to intervene collectively to counter an attack on any one of them a CIS armed forces general staff continued to exist until mid1993 But from the outset the CIS was split into two factions the first of which Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Russia Tajikistan and Uzbekistan was markedly more committed than the others Azerbaijan Georgia Moldova Turkmenistan and Ukraine Azerbaijan quit the CIS in 1992 following the advent to power of the Azerbaijan Popular Front AHC but rejoined in late 1993 after the AHC leadership was ousted Georgia was coerced into joining in late 1993 by Russian threats to withhold energy suppliesIn January 1993 the CIS presidents adopted a new charter and statutes and in September of that year they reached agreement in principle on creating an economic union But already the centrifugal tendencies that precipitated the collapse of the USSR were evident within the CIS Uzbek President Islam Karimov complained in April 1993 that the CIS had already adopted 270 documents that his country found unacceptable and would not abide by Writing in Rossiiskie vesti in December 1996 one commentator note that implementing one CIS agreement is more difficult than signing 10 new onesThe process of signing ever more documents that were never implemented nonetheless continued for several years until at a CIS summit in late March 1997 hardline Russian political scientists Andranik Migranian and Konstantin Zatulin unveiled a program intended to restore Russias status as unacknowledged leader within the CIS Warning that the CIS risked becoming a fiction they advocated radical measures including the deliberate destabilization of the domestic political situation within selected CIS states Georgia Azerbaijan and Tajikistan to reverse the perceived drift of the former Soviet republics away from Russia They argued that the founders of the CIS had committed a fundamental error by selecting the wrong from Russias point of view model namely EUstyle integration and that reunification of the two Germanies would have been far more appropriateThat blueprint set off alarm bells across the CIS and served as the catalyst for the foundation in late 1997 of GUAM a loose geopolitical alignment encompassing Georgia Ukraine Azerbaijan and Moldova Uzbekistan acceded to GUAM in April 1999In a possible acknowledgement that the scare tactics espoused by Migranian and Zatulin had proven counterproductive in April 1998 Russian oligarch Boris Berezovskii was appointed CIS executive secretary with a brief to persuade the CIS presidents to endorse and then implement a blueprint for closer and more effective economic cooperation beginning with the creation of one or more CIS freetrade zones An agreement in principle to form such zones had been signed in April 1994 but shared the same fate as hundreds of other collective statements of intent that were signed but never implemented Meanwhile the core CIS states  Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan which had formed a customs union in 1995 to which Kyrgyzstan acceded the following year  were mulling the creation of a Single Economic Space together with UkraineTwo developments seemed to infuse new vitality into the CIS albeit only briefly the election of Vladimir Putin to succeed Boris Yeltsin as Russian president and the creation in November 2001 of a CIS Antiterrrorism Center Then in 2003 the CIS drafted but failed to endorse a new 10part plan for expanding economic cooperation the first stage of which was to be the creation of a freetrade zone That failure to move decisively forward prompted Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev one of the most enthusiastic proponents of closer CIS integration in both the economic and political spheres to propose at a CIS summit in Astana in September 2004 transforming the Single Economic Space into the nucleus of a superCIS while the remaining CIS members confined their cooperation within that body to the military sphere Nazarbaev also proposed other measures to streamline the CIS and make it more effective including abolishing the CIS Economic Court and several other bodies and reducing the staff of the CIS Executive Committee from 220 to 140 according to Vremya novostei on 17 September 2004 The summit participants agreed to reach a final decision on Nazarbaevs reform proposals within 12 monthsIn the event however last weeks CIS summit in Kazan failed yet again to yield a consensus on reform the participants decided to readdress the issue at their next summit tentatively scheduled for 2006 in Belarus An alternative blueprint for reform drafted by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko was reportedly not included in the agenda Despite the ongoing uncertainty however Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin described the Kazan summit as one of the most productive ever according to The Moscow Times on 29 August That comment may however prove to be premature in light of two related developments First in line with its predilection for structuring its foreign policy exclusively on bilateral rather than multilateral ties and agreements Turkmenistan has finally admitted its total lack of interest in the CIS and formally requested that its status be downgraded to that of associate member Article 8 of the CIS Statutes adopted in January 1993 provides for states with such associate membership to participate in selected CIS activities with the formal consent of the CIS full members Some might argue that the effective exclusion of Turkmenistan from the CIS equation is a positive development insofar as it removes an obstacle to closer and more effective economic integration Others however might see it as the thin end of a much larger wedge  a wedge that the unequivocally Westernoriented CIS members in the first instance Georgia and Ukraine might seek to use at some future point to deal the coup de grace by announcing their collective withdrawalOne unfortunate incident at the summits opening ceremony on 26 August  shown on Russian television  perfectly symbolized the CISs dilemma The presidents gathered in a magnificent new conference center only to find the air conditioning did not function and the windows would not open Putin perspiring visibly looked on as a workman wielding a crowbar was summoned to force open a window and let in some fresh air  a commodity without which the CIS will suffocate sooner or later The question being which president will wield the crowbar

Minsk Group that is mediating the search for a solution to the Karabakh conflict released a statement similarly noting that the two presidents confirmed their strong interest in reaching a peaceful negotiated solution of the conflictGrowing ExpectationsIn early July Armenian officials told RFERLs Armenian Service that Armenia and Azerbaijan had reached agreement on the key points of a formal peace accord ending the Karabakh conflict and that agreement could be signed by the end of this year Days later the Minsk Group cochairmen likewise expressed cautious optimism US coChairman Steven Mann told journalists in Yerevan on 14 July that there is a possibility of a Karabakh settlement in the course of this year RFERLs Armenian Service reported Mann repeated that prognosis the following day but qualified it saying There are very difficult issues that are still on the table and real gaps between the two sides Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov who is President Aliyevs special envoy for the Karabakh conflict was even more upbeat telling journalists in Baku on 18 July that we are closer to peace than ever before according to the website dayazCiting the need for confidentiality the Minsk Group cochairmen have consistently declined to divulge any details of specific issues under discussion But both Azerbaijani and Armenian officials have gone public in recent months identifying aspects of the hypothetical peace agreement In midMay Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov claimed that Yerevan had agreed to and the two sides were already discussing the time frame for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR The Armenian Foreign Ministry rejected Mammadyarovs claim the following dayThe timing of the Kazan summit  two months before the 6 November parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan  in itself makes it unlikely that the two presidents would sign a formal peace deal that would require a major concession from Baku because any such concession could alienate many voters But Russian Minsk Group coChairman Yurii Merzlyakov was quoted on 17 August by dayaz as suggesting that the two presidents might issue a joint statement hinting that a formal peace deal is imminentThree weeks later on 7 June Mammadyarov told journalists in Baku that the two sides were discussing between seven and nine issues related to a peace settlement and that those issues have to be addressed in a specific order with each made secure before the following is added like pearls knotted on a silk thread Mammadyarov said Azerbaijan insists on the liberation of the seven districts currently occupied by Armenian forces and that the two sides are discussing which countries or organizations could provide peacekeeping forces to be deployed on those territories after their liberation according to dayaz He also said that after the frontiers are opened we must revive trade links and transport Echoazcom quoted Mammadyarov as saying that the two sides are discussing both the phased and the package approaches to resolving the conflict But a senior Armenian Foreign Ministry official told this writer on 8 June on condition of anonymity that the final agreement will be a package one although its various provisions might be implemented one after the other rather than simultaneouslyThen in early July a senior Armenian official told RFERLs Armenian Service that under the anticipated peace deal Armenia would return to Azerbaijani control five of the seven districts adjacent to Karabakh currently controlled by Karabakh Armenian forces excluding the strategic Lachin corridor A peacekeeping force comprising troops from countries that are not members of the OSCE Minsk Group would be deployed in the conflict zone Then after 1015 years the population of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic would be required to vote in a referendum on whether the region should become independent become a part of Armenia or revert to Azerbaijan That blueprint is very similar to one proposed in December by former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio and NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche But both Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Azimov and NKR Foreign Minister Arman Melikian promptly denied that the two sides were discussing a possible referendum Azimov made the point that the constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic does not make provision for a referendum to be held only on selected parts of Azerbaijans territory or on issues related to the countrys territorial integrityPulling BackSince the beginning of August  when Mammadyarov visited Washington  the upbeat statements by both the Minsk Group cochairs and officials from the Armenian and Azerbaijani Foreign Ministries have given way to more guarded pronouncements Commenting on 6 August on Mammadyarovs visit US Minsk Group coChairman Mann said the Karabakh conflict was one of the issues Mammadyarov discussed with his US counterpart Condoleezza Rice dayaz reported Mann added that despite certain progress in the peace talks the degree of consensus reached to date is not sufficient to sign a peace treaty In an interview published on 17 August in the online daily zerkaloaz Mann similarly said that it is still early to speak of a specific document It would be a mistake to affirm that we shall sign some document right now At the same time he stressed repeatedly that the two sides have achieved a great deal over the past 18 months and he predicted that the upcoming Kazan meeting between Kocharian and Aliyev will give an additional impulse to the talksAlso on 17 August Mammadyarov echoed Mann almost wordfor word telling dayaz that the negotiations have not yet reached the level of signing a document Echoing his comments of 7 June he said that between seven and nine issues would be on the agenda at his 24 August meeting with Oskanian and we shall try to reach agreement on certain elements and inform the presidents so that they can discuss them in KazanThe timing of the Kazan summit  two months before the 6 November

the presidents in which they would order their foreign ministers to start working on the text of a future agreement Such a joint statement would serve to send the message to Azerbaijans electorate

of acting the art of performing and the art of speech And then there is the axis where all of these arts merge into a harmonious union  opera ,Yerevan 12 August 2005 RFERL  There is the art of dancing the art of singing the art of acting the art of performing and the art of speech And then there is the axis where all of these arts merge into a harmonious union  opera In Armenia opera appears to undergoing a kind of rebirth Anush composer Armen Tigranians opera based on the poem of the same name by the legendary writer Hovhannes Toumanian recently returned to the stage with performances at the National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet in Yerevan Before the curtain rose and the flow of music dance and voices joined the flow of our souls I went to the ballerinas dressing room to talk about opera and ballet Which operas do our ballet dancers wish could be staged as part of our opera sceneI wish modern dance was part of the Armenian arts scene one ballerina says We have very very little of it almost none at all Wed like very much to see Spartak staged or for the ballet Antuni to be restored Id love to dance Saint Ripsime and Trdat again The absence of male dancers is the main reason that composer Aram Khachaturyans Spartak has not been part of the Armenian culture scene for many years Armenias male dancers are conquering stages abroad Id say our mind is more romantic our thoughts develop in a more idealistic ethereal manner We are prone to idealism Besides we prefer classical music But that doesnt mean that we only listen to Bach Rakhmaninov or Beethoven We also go to the discoOur Armenian boys are really great Were proud of them another ballerina says But they dont dance here theyre spread out all over the world and keep winning the amazement and admiration of the world audience First of all here our young men have to serve in the army and its impossible for a ballet dancer to return to ballet and dance after having spent two years in military boots Asked to name their ballet idols the ballerinas say Maya Plisetskaya and Ekaterina Maksimova And what about the roles they hope to danceI dream of dancing Carmen Then perhaps Kitri one saysId like to dance all the leading roles in Carmen and Giselle and Chopeniana and Gayane and in other ballets says anotherWhat is daytoday life like for these young ballerinas What makes them different from other Armenian girlsWe devote most of our time to dancing and very little time is left for an outside life one says We always try hard to keep fit to not gain weight Id say our mindset our way of thinking is quite different another adds We have a different approach to any issue Id say our mind is more romantic our thoughts develop in a more idealistic ethereal manner We are prone to idealism Besides we prefer classical music But that doesnt mean that we only listen to Bach Rakhmaninov or Beethoven We also go to the disco And what about their private life Not every man can have a relationship with a ballerina  marrying her and starting a family says one of the ballerinas There are guys who after marriage simply dont put up with their wife ballet dancing But this applies to narrowminded limited guys If a person were spiritually rich hed never prevent his wife from engaging in this kind of art On the contrary hed be extremely happy that his wife performs such a beautiful wonderful and dazzling artOf course my boyfriend understands me and makes some concessions another addsMy boyfriend will never stop me from ballet dancing because he is receptive to my art says a third He really loves and appreciates me and my art he knows that I simply cant live without it And using this occasion I want to say that I love him Some Armenian men dont allow their girlfriend or wife to continue ballet dancing But even under these circumstances most girls prefer a family to a career in danceIf I had to choose between a family and ballet I would opt for the family one says Happiness in my private life is more important for me What is essential for me is to have a beloved husband and good children and to always be by their side Id rather not face the question another says It was interesting to hear about the subtlety and sensitivity of the ballerinas from the point of view of their teacher Its a great pleasure for me to work with ballerinas because Im very fond of this art she says The girls are really nice very caring and perceptive They are endowed with all the good traits Most certainly they differ from the other girls as far as their intellect is concerned And not only that they differ in many things They have a subtle sensitivity to all the psychological experiences a human being can have The girls noted that nowadays the opera audience has substantially increased especially among young people We are very happy about the fact that interest in the opera and ballet especially among young people has grown considerably recently one of them says Another adds Id like to add that the opera hall is always sold out One of the dancers suggests that young people now consider the opera more fashionable and modern than for instance going to clubs There are plans to restore the ballet Antuni as well as to form a new program with a variety including modern dance in the near future It really seems impossible to resist the gravitational pull of this magnetic art form once you have penetrated it This story was originally broadcast by RFERLs Armenian Service and was a finalist in RFERLs June 2005 Division of Broadcasting Innovation Excellence award

received the additional 20000 Therefore according to Alimuradov he decided to hand over to the Azerbaijani authorities the video footage of the meeting he was given by the Armenian A Crude FabricationBashirlis fellow oppositionists however have dismissed the prosecutorgenerals account as a crude and clumsy fabrication intended to discredit the AHCP in the runup to the 6 November parliamentary election and Kerimli personally Bashirli himself reportedly told his attorney Elchin Garalov on 8 August that he was being pressured to incriminate Kerimli whom the website dayaz on 6 August identified as one of Azerbaijans most popular and respected opposition politicians The online daily echoazcom on 6 August quoted progovernment political scientist Mubariz Akhmedoglu as saying Bashirli is clearly guilty of treason and the links between him and the AHCP are adequate grounds for revoking that partys official registration Speaking at a press conference in Baku on 5 August two deputy chairmen of Yeni Fikir Said Nuriev and Fikret Faramazoglu said that Bashirli was offered the 2000 by representatives of Georgian and Armenian democratic forces They said he was drunk at the time and hypothesized that his drink may have been spiked They said that the following day Bashirli returned the money Both the official charges against Bashirli and the opposition objections to those charges are based on the incriminating video materials which show Bashirli sipping cognac in the company of three men and uttering incriminating statements Specifically he is said to have agreed to the proposal made by one of the Armenian agents to take advantage of the tense domestic political situation in Azerbaijan and even open fire at an opposition demonstration Questions About VideoBut Bashirlis lawyer Gambarov told journalists in Baku on 8 August that the video footage was edited and that Bashirlis words were taken out of context zerkaloaz reported on 9 August Moreover as several Azerbaijani commentaries have pointed out Bashirlis drunken pronouncements cannot be conflated with a statement of intent to overthrow the present leadership Even more problematic than the content of the videocassette is the way the Azerbaijani authorities allegedly acquired it As Bashirlis lawyer Gambarov observed on 8 August No intelligence service in the world would hand over a videocassette with compromising footage to someone whom it was seeking to coopt In an article entitled Armenian recruitment or planned operation the independent online daily zerkaloaz on 6 August similarly asked why the Armenians should have given the cassette to Alimuradov Are the Armenian special services really so stupid the daily asked that they would play into the hands of their Azerbaijani counterparts The daily further noted that the Azerbaijani ProsecutorGenerals Office acted unprofessionally in immediately making public the contents of the cassette rather than handing it to the National Security Ministry to permit it to try to identify and obtain more watertight evidence against the purported Armenian agents Zerkaloaz went to far as to suggest that the case against Bashirli was fabricated by the Azerbaijani authorities But Akhmedoglu dismissed that possibility telling dayaz on 6 August that I do not think that the Azerbaijani authorities are powerful enough to try to manipulate the Armenian special services or certain Georgian circles What Lies BeneathPending the emergence of new evidence it is impossible at this juncture to determine with any certainty which of the above hypotheses is correct But if as Bashirlis supporters claim the case against him was fabricated in Baku then the question arises by whom and to what end Was it simply a bid to discredit Kerimli and his party in the runup to the 6 November ballot or even to trigger widespread unrest that could be adduced for postponing that ballot Or could the real object of the exercise be totally different Given the rumored existence of rival factions within the upper echelons of the Azerbaijani leadership was the hapless Bashirli simply a pawn in a larger scheme either to embarrass President Ilham Aliyev and call into question his professed commitment to building a democratic society or to reignite popular hostility towards Armenia at a point when Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe

parliamentary in 2000 and presidential in 2003 the opposition proved unable to align in a single bloc or behind a single candidate And observers are predicting that up to 20 candidates might register to contest each of the 125 seats in the new parliament to be elected on 6 November,In the runup to the 1998 Azerbaijani presidential election five of the countrys most respected opposition leaders demonstrated their anger at the authorities refusal to create equal conditions for all candidates by collectively refusing to compete But in two subsequent national elections parliamentary in 2000 and presidential in 2003 the opposition proved unable to align in a single bloc or behind a single candidate And observers are predicting that up to 20 candidates might register to contest each of the 125 seats in the new parliament to be elected on 6 NovemberThe formal process of registering parties and blocs and the individual candidates they will field is still under way and ends only on 7 September But it already seems probable that the number of blocs and parties will exceed that registered in 2000 when then President Heidar Aliyev intervened just weeks before the ballot to overturn the initial refusal by the Central Election Commission MSK to register eight of the 13 parties that hoped to participate see RFERL Caucasus Report 13 October 2000 To date the MSK has registered five blocs according to its website httpwwwcecgovaz and dayaz on 28 July They are the progovernment Islahat the Azadlyg and Yeni Siyaset aka YeS opposition blocs Democratic Azerbaijan For the Sake of Azerbaijan and the Alliance for the Flourishing of Azerbaijan comprising the eponymous party and the Rebirth party The MSK rejected on 24 July the initial registration application submitted by the bloc ProAzerbaijani Forces due to a minor infringement echoazcom reported on 26 July Further opposition blocs seeking registration are Public Leaders Alliance in the Name of Azerbaijan Building a Civic Society National Unity and the Union for Democratic ReformsDemands for free and fair elections have figured prominently at all opposition demonstrations so far this summer and have largely overshadowed other issues such as approaches to democratization economic and social policy Azerbaijans foreign policy orientation and how to resolve the Karabakh conflictSeveral opposition parties and blocs have affirmed their hypothetical readiness to expand to include new members andor have concluded agreements among themselves to coordinate the nomination of candidates to ensure they do not end up competing against each other in individual constituencies For example Liberal Party leader Avez Temirkhan dropped his plans to contest one Baku constituency in favor of Eldar Namazov of YeS dayaz reported on 27 July But on the other hand Azadlyg rejected the overtures of Umid party Chairman Igbal Agazade for reasons that the latter declined to disclose according to dayaz on 8 July Two former leading members of one party have registered from the same constituency Etibar Mamedov former chairman of the Azerbaijan National Independence Party and now a member of YeS and his former Deputy Chairman Nazim Imanov will compete against each other in Bakus Yasamal Raion dayaz and echoazcom reported on 11 and 13 July respectively And YeS plans to register former President Ayaz Mutalibov to contest Constituency No 17 in Baku where National Unity leader LalaShovket Gadjieva who quit YeS due to a disagreement over election tactics also plans to register according to dayaz on 23 July Those plans may fall flat however if the Azerbaijani authorities refuse to permit Mutalibov to return to Baku from his 13year exile in MoscowA further factor that militates against greater cooperation and coordination among opposition forces according to Namazov is widespread mutual suspicion The Azerbaijani media have for months if not years engaged in unsubstantiated rumors and speculation about possible clandestine deals being cut between opposition forces and oligarchs from within the ruling elite Such speculation means Namazov told dayaz on 28 June that there is no clearcut mechanism for determining whether you are dealing with a real oppositionist or a politician who is playing at being part of the oppositionThe anticipated fierce competition between rival parties and blocs is all the more difficult to explain in light of the absence of any fundamental policy differences among the opposition parties True the opposition can be broadly divided as the independent daily zerkaloaz noted on 28 June into the traditional opposition parties of which the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party AHCP Musavat the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijan National Independence Party are the most prominent and the new liberal parties and blocs including YeS and the Party of Democratic Reforms recently founded by Assim Mollazade a former leading AHCP member Some observers consider the traditional opposition especially the three parties aligned in Azadlyg discredited as a result of the humiliating defeat of their candidate Musavat Party Chairman Isa Qambar in the 2003 presidential ballot and the liberals apparently hope to capitalize on that perceptionBut even so as in 2000 and 2003 the overriding issue is the demand by all opposition parties that this time around the ballot be free fair democratic and transparent and the authorities should not be permitted to retain power by resorting to what Gerard Stoudmann then director of the OSCEs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights referred to in the wake of the November 2000 parliamentary ballot as a crash course in manipulation of the outcome Demands for free and fair elections have figured prominently at all opposition demonstrations so far this summer and have largely overshadowed other issues such as approaches to democratization economic and social policy Azerbaijans foreign policy orientation and how to resolve the Karabakh conflict US Deputy Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky touched on that ideological vacuum during a speech in Baku on 27 July stressing that all political parties carry responsibility to participate fully in the election process through nonviolent campaigns that explain issuespecific messages and platforms to voters The people of Azerbaijan must have real choices

Federation IHF covers human rights developments in 38 member states of the OSCE in 2004Aaron Rhodes executive director of the IHF told RFERL Its difficult to make a generalization about human rights in such a group of countries some of which are the most democratic and liberal countries in the world and some others are extremely repressive But what you can say is that in some areas especially not much progress is being made in human rightsThe 38 countries reviewed in the IHF report are located in Europe the Caucasus Central Asia and North America Twentyfour are former socialist states while 13 are established Western democracies Turkey is also includedAccording to the IHF judicial systems fell short of international standards in more than 60 percent of the 38 countries reviewed Corruption the lack of judicial independence and the poor training of judicial professionals were of particular concern Armenia Azerbaijan Kyrgyzstan Macedonia Serbia Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were singled out as needing further improvementRhodes says reports of police brutality or other police misconduct were received from 80 percent of the countries under scrutiny We found that in 80 percent of the countries that we scrutinized in this report there are serious problems as regards police brutality he said And in 10 of them some of the practices constituted torture In a majority of countries that are covered in the report there are problems in prisons especially overcrowdingThe document says 60 percent of the countries reviewed violated the right to asylum or other rights of refugees and migrants According to the report antiterrorism measures also curtailed many basic rights throughout the region including in Britain the Russian republic of Chechnya the United States and UzbekistanRhodes says the IHFs report should not be construed as a criticism of the OSCE but is rather meant to highlight how well the groups members are adhering to their human rights commitmentsThe OSCE is a framework in which participating states can work together to raise the level of compliance with the human rights commitments that are undertaken in the OSCE process Rhodes said Some states honor their commitments and some states ignore their commitments Of course you cant blame the OSCE as such for the failure of its members to approach their obligations in the OSCE in an honorable wayUrdur Gunnarsdottir a spokeswoman for the OSCEs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw agrees Many of the concerns that the International Helsinki Federation raises are the

parliamentary elections which remained unoccupied In a further serious blow to the opposition the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement was liquidatedMeanwhile media ownership remained highly concentrated in the hands of companies close to President Nursultan Nazarbaev The threat of libel and defamation charges also encouraged widespread selfcensorship among media outlets The situation regarding freedom of religion deteriorated toward the end of the year with reports of new cases of harassment against unregistered religious communities The authorities further stepped up efforts to control the practice of Islam KYRGYZSTANSerious human rights violations continued in Kyrgyzstan in 2004 with human rights activists journalists and independent media outlets facing intimidation and

December 2004 largely succeeded in controlling nearly all sectors of the countrys political economic social and cultural lives Many crucial questions regarding the judicial system remained unsolved showing a lack of genuine will to make the judiciary truly independent Accountability of lawenforcement officers for misconduct has not improved New cases of illtreatment were reported including unlawful use of firearms which in some cases led to deaths Religious minority groups faced harassment and the representation of national or ethnic minorities in political life was restricted by new legal provisions RUSSIAN FEDERATIONAll sides in Chechnyas conflict committed serious abuses against civilians including disappearances torture and extrajudicial killings Such abuses were increasingly perpetrated by armed formations operating under officials loyal to Moscow In the name of fighting terrorism Moscow also engaged in efforts to further centralize power restrict democratic and civil liberties and establish bureaucratic control over civil society Human rights defenders and independent journalists were harassed in particular those who were critical of official antiterrorism

were critical of the authorities were also reported The government continued to restrict independent religious activities Numerous members and supporters of the banned Hizb utTahrir Islamic group were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms in trials that fell short of international due process standards In these and other cases torture and illtreatment were frequently reported

opposition movements or alternative mass media in the country Security police continued to closely monitor all organized activity and harassed members of religious minorities and nongovernmental organizations Members of ethnic minorities were systematically discriminated against in employment and education UKRAINEThe political developments in Ukraine were dominated in 2004 by protests that led to opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko being elected presidentDuring the October election campaign state media openly supported the progovernment candidate Viktor Yanukovych Several critical media outlets were suspended and journalists fired Largescale arrests and shortterm detention of opposition activists were also commonplace during the campaign UNITED STATES The IHF says the United States reputation as an advocate of human rights and democracy continued to be seriously damaged by its own human rights record in 2004Coercive interrogation tactics that frequently amounted to degrading treatment and even torture of detainees were common practice in places of detention outside the United States but under US military control such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq In addition a number of practices that undermine international law and human rights standards have became prevalent in the US governments war on terror They included the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects who were neither charged with a crime nor brought before a court and the practice of transferring suspects to states known for torturing detainees In positive developments the US Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional for individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their offense UZBEKISTANAs in previous years the Uzbek government prevented opposition parties from participating in the parliamentary elections in December 2004Media remained under strict state control during the campaign leading up to the polls while authorities further stepped up efforts to restrict the circulation of independent information Human rights defenders were subjected to persecution including detention and physical assault In response

detention facility at Guantanamo Bay She contends Jamil was simply studying engineering in Pakistan and regrets how difficult his ordeal has been on his childrenThe eldest one remembers her father and in the street sometimes she looks at people and thinks shes seen her dad Suad says The 4yearold was only 1 when he left and does not remember him And the youngest one doesnt know him In truth the eldest is very affected She is very sensitive She remembers her fatherJamil is one of more than 500 detainees being held without charges at the US naval base in Cuba on suspicion of links to AlQaeda or the Taliban The detention of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo as well as the transfer of some 100 detainees to their home countries are singled out for criticism by Amnesty International in the annual surveyIrene Khan Amnesty Internationals secretarygeneral says 2004 saw governments not only failing to fulfill human rights pledges but betraying those promises in places such as Guantanamo Bay Iraq Afghanistan Chechnya and in Sudans troubled Darfur regionThe report disputes claims by the Russian government that the conflict in Chechnya is normalizing It says security forces enjoyed virtual impunity for human rights abuses including reports that Russian soldiers tortured raped and sexually abused womenTake the situation in Darfur where the UN Security Council failed to take action despite reports of increasing abuse of human rights there Khan says The government of China failed to act because of its own oil interests there The government of Russia failed to act because of its arms trade with the Sudanese government And the United States called Darfur genocide but failed to follow it up with any effective action Take the promise of security which governments made but failed to provide in Iraq or AfghanistanKhan says Washington has instead gone to great lengths to restrict the application of the Geneva Conventions and to sanitize and redefine torture by seeking to justify coercive interrogation techniques She says the United States  the worlds unrivaled superpower  has failed in its role of setting human rights standardsIn its report Amnesty calls the US detention facility at Guantanamo the gulag of our times Brendan Paddy is a spokesman for Amnesty InternationalBy saying that Guantanamo Bay is the gulag of our times Amnesty International is not attempting to draw any direct comparison between the treatment or scale of the Soviet gulag system and Guantanamo Bay and other detention centers run by the US Paddy says What we are saying is that we are gravely concerned that whats happening at Guantanamo is entrenching a practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international lawThe US State Department declined to comment on the Amnesty report until its releaseBut James Phillips who specializes in foreign policy issues at the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank in Washington says he believes the United States is setting a good example for the rest of the world He says the detainees at Guantanamo represent a real threatI think Amnesty International underestimates the threats posed in the war of terrorism and that the US government is legally acting in keeping these people on Guantanamo Phillips says Some of the prisoners that have been released from Guantanamo have already returned to inciting and carrying out terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan so I think they are at Guantanamo for a good reasonThe Amnesty report covers 149 countries  from Afghanistan to ZimbabweRussiaThe report disputes claims by the Russian government that the conflict in Chechnya is normalizing It says security forces enjoyed virtual impunity for human rights abuses including reports that Russian soldiers tortured raped and sexually abused womenClearly there have been very grave abuses committed by armed Chechen separatist groups most notably those in Beslan which were clearly absolutely horrific and wholly without any justification of any sort Paddy says But what is equally disturbing is that in Chechnya itself we have also seen armed forces of both the Chechen government supported by Moscow and also by Russian forces themselves committing horrific abductions rapes and murders against Chechen civiliansAmnesty says the human rights situation in Ingushetia also deteriorated and that ethnic and national minorities were attacked in many Russian regions sometimes fatally with few convictions for racist attacksAfghanistanAfghanistan was plagued in 2004 by lawlessness and insecurity which hampered efforts to establish peace and stability Amnesty says Afghan women in particular experienced widespread discrimination and violenceOne of the particularly disturbing things about the situation in Afghanistan is  regardless of who appears to be in control in each area  the situation for women has not improved to any significant extent as far as we can judge Paddy says Weve seen numerous cases of women being subjected to what amounts to tribal justice where the writ of Afghan law does not seem to runMiddle EastIn Iraq Amnesty accuses both USled military forces and armed militant groups of committing gross human rights violations Thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed in the crossfireIn Iran Amnesty notes scores of political prisoners were sentenced to prison following unfair trials Many more were arrested in 2004 on charges that articles they had written endangered national security or defamed officials or Islamic religious precepts Central AsiaIn Central Asia Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are cited for threatening Uyghur asylum seekers and refugees with detention and expulsion to China Conditions on death row in Kyrgyzstan are described as cruel and inhuman And despite its own moratorium on capital punishment Amnesty says Bishkek deported prisoners to China and Uzbekistan where they faced executionUzbekistan is condemned for what Amnesty describes as its appalling human rights record in 2004One of the most serious concerns that Amnesty has had about Uzbekistan is the apparent reluctance in parts of the international community particularly on the part of the United States to directly challenge the government regarding its human rights record which has been appalling in 2004 apparently because of the close connection between the two governments in their socalled war on terror Paddy says One of the consequences of this is the government of Uzbekistan may have misunderstood the latitude it had in responding to the more recent protests which have occurred in the east of the countryAmnesty notes the arbitrary detention of hundreds of devout Muslim men and women in Uzbekistan following a series of attacks and bombings in 2004 It says scores were given unfair trials and sentenced to long prison terms Evidence obtained through torture was routinely admitted in courtHuman rights abuses were also widespread in Turkmenistan where Amnesty says religious minorities and civil society activists faced harassment and imprisonmentIn Tajikistan reports of torture and ill treatment by police were noted Amnesty says at least four men were executed in secret shortly before a moratorium on the death penalty took effectTranscaucasusIn the Caucasus police in Armenia and Georgia are criticized for the use of excessive force while courts in Azerbaijan are singled out for reportedly using evidence extracted under torture and for sentencing at least 40 opposition activists to jail after unfair trialsRoom For OptimismBut Amnesty says 2004 also witnessed progress on the human rights front Paddy says people in Ukraine and the Middle East for example felt increasingly willing to challenge government failures He also highlights legal challenges to what Amnesty calls the dangerous new agenda being pursued by many governmentsThere have obviously also in 2004 been some hopeful signs that people that the judiciary that parts of the UN system will not accept the betrayal of governments of the promises they have made Paddy says We have seen for example both in the UK and also in the US the highest courts in those respective countries directly challenging the executives removal of certain fundamental rights from particular prisoners in Guantanamo and in the case of the UK those held at Belmarsh prison under suspicion of involvement in terrorismPaddy also notes positive movement toward reform at the United Nations in particular in its flawed human rights mechanisms He says the mission of governments and international institutions must now be to reassert the primacy of human rightsThe most critical thing that governments can do  rather than making new promises and new pronouncements about their respect for justice the rule of law human dignity and human rights  is turn that rhetoric into reality Paddy says Most of the law that is needed to protect people from these grave violations and to lay the bedrock of respect for the rule of law which must be the basis on which you can build any just stable secure and peaceful society rather than respect those they continue to make new promisesAmnesty says the popular movements in support of the victims of the South Asian tsunami and the Madrid train bombings prove the power of ordinary people to promote hope over fearRFERL correspondent Andrew F Tully contributed to this

https://www.rferl.org/a/1058945.html,Azerbaijan Armenia Denies Agreeing To Leave Seven Occupied Districts ,"May 19, 2005 23:47 GMT",But on 18 May the Armenian Foreign Ministry released a formal rebuttal of Mammadyarovs statement,But on 18 May the Armenian Foreign Ministry released a formal rebuttal of Mammadyarovs statementThe seven districts in question have been under the control of Armenian forces for the past 12 years and many observers consider them Yerevans sole ace to be traded for a major concession by Baku on the NKRs final future status under any eventual peace agreement the socalled land for status model of conflict resolutionMammadyarovs statement may have been intended to derail the Karabakh peace talks temporarily by putting the Armenian side on the defensiveMammadyarov said on 17 May that talks are already under way on the timeframe for an Armenian withdrawal from the seven occupied districts He added however that this would be a lengthy process in light of the need to address related problems such as mineclearing postconflict rehabilitation of the districts in question and the return to their abandoned homes of those districts ethnic Azerbaijani population according todayaz on 17 MayOn 18 May however Armenian Foreign Ministry spokeman Hamlet Gasparian released a statement in Yerevan denying that Armenia has agreed to liberate the seven Azerbaijani regions At the same time Gasparian described as a further step forward towards resolving the Karabakh conflict the talks between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev in Warsaw on 15 May on the sidelines of the Council of Europe summit In line with the longstanding confidentiality agreement surrounding the negotiations see RFERL Caucasus Report 9 July 2004 Gasparian did not divulge any details of what the two presidents discussed But both he and the three cochairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group which is mediating the peace talks said the Warsaw meeting opens the way for a continuation of the socalled Prague talks between Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian that began one year ago Mammadyarov and Oskanian met in Warsaw on 15 May with the Minsk Group cochairsRumors of a possible Armenian withdrawal from three five or all seven of the occupied Azerbaijan districts have been circulating for several years In early 2004 the European Parliament rapporteur for the South Caucasus Per Gahrton circulated a draft report on the South Caucasus that included a proposal that Armenia should cede five of the occupied districts in exchange for the resumption of rail traffic from Azerbaijan to Armenia The five districts in question were Jebrayil Fizuli Zangelan Agdam and Gubadla but not the strategic Lachin corridor that serves as the sole overland road link between the NKR and Armenia Senior Azerbaijani officials including Parliament Speaker Murtuz Alesqerov were quoted as expressing support for Gahrtons proposal Alesqerov told the European Commissions special envoy Antonius De Vries in Baku on 29 January that Azerbaijan accepts this plan We believe the liberation of the districts can promote the restoration of the territorial integrity of the country InterfaxAzerbaijan reported on 30 January 2004 But the European Parliament ultimately deleted that proposal from the draft resolution before adopting it see RFERL Caucasus Report 27 February 2004 Mammadyarovs deputy Araz Azimov told journalists in January 2005 following the most recent Prague meeting between the two foreign ministers that an Armenian withdrawal from all seven districts was on the agenda of the Prague talks according to zerkaloaz on 14 January But Armenian officials including Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian have dismissed any talk of an exchange of the occupied districts for the resumption of rail traffic as unseriousIf Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev did indeed make progress at their meeting in Warsaw  their first meeting in eight months  it is unclear why Mammadyarov should have immediately jeopardized that progress by violating the confidentialty of the talks with a statement that Yerevan immediately rebutted as untrue One possible explanation suggested by Armenian majority Republican Party of Armenia parliament faction head Galust Sahakian in an interview with A1 is that Mammadyarovs announcement was intended first and foremost for domestic consumption to create the impression that Baku has scored a major diplomatic victory at a time when the Azerbaijani leadership is under increasing pressure from the international community to amend its election legislation and take other related steps to ensure that the parliamentary elections due in November are free fair transparent and democratic Alternatively Mammadyarovs statement may have been intended to derail the Karabakh peace talks temporarily until after the parliamentary elections by putting the Armenian side on the defensive in the face of accusations from the opposition that it has sold out and compromised the future security of the NKR by ceding control of the Lachin corridor Such a delay would obviate the need for Azerbaijani to announce publicly in the runup to the November ballot any unpalatable concessions on Karabakh which the opposition could seek to turn to its advantage

chargesWith opposition groups encouraged by the successes of antiestablishment revolutions in Georgia Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan and closely following statements from Washington that seem to be urging them to follow these examples the danger of crackdowns  especially in countries like Belarus and Uzbekistan  has also been heightened The United States could find itself in a position similar to the

the conflict settlement process following his previous meeting with Mammadyarov in January see RFERL Caucasus Report 21 January 2005 But the Minsk Groups failure to reschedule the Prague meeting fuelled speculation that unanticipated obstacles to the peace process had emergedSecond a considerable number of minor violations of the ceasefire agreement signed 11 years ago have been registered in recent weeks on the Line of Contact separating Armenian and Azerbaijani forces At least six servicemen have reportedly been killed in those exchanges of fire see RFERL Newsline 23 March 2005 Several Armenian politicians have construed that escalation of lowlevel hostilities which Oskanian said on 29 March is the result of Azerbaijani efforts to move their front line closer to Armenian positions as evidence that Azerbaijan is preparing for a major new offensive  an assumption that is corroborated by the militant rhetoric of Azerbaijani President Aliev and Defense Minister Colonel General Safar Abiev Oskanian initially told journalists on 23 March he thinks such rhetoric is intended for a domestic audience Noyan Tapan reported But one week later addressing the Armenian parliament he admitted the possibility that Baku may seriously intend to start military actions see RFERL Newsline 30 March 2005 It is not clear whether as Oskanian and defense officials from the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic NKR have claimed Azerbaijan was indeed the aggressor during the recent spate of shootings along the Line of Contact But it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Baku was prepared to risk provoking such limited exchanges of fire and blaming them on the Armenian side in order to deflect public attention from the recent report released by the OSCE Minsk Group on the situation in the seven districts adjacent to the NKR which are under Armenian control That report presented to the OSCEs Permanent Council in Vienna last month effectively demolishes Azerbaijani allegations that the Armenian government has over the past decade engaged in a deliberate and systematic attempt to resettle tens of thousands of Armenians on those territories An OSCE factfinding mission that toured the districts in question in late January and early February at the request of the Azerbaijani government concluded that resettlement is quite limited strictly voluntary and not the result of a deliberate Armenian government policy and that most of the Armenians resettlers involved are displaced persons from other regions of Azerbaijan It estimated the total number of such Armenian settlers as less than 15000 in contrast to Azerbaijani projections of over 30000 see RFERL Newsline 18 March 2005 Despite the recent ceasefire violations both Oskanian and Mammadyarov remain publicly committed to the search for new blueprints for resolving the conflict  even though their respective priorities may be difficult to reconcile On 29 March Oskanian addressed a special twoday session of the Armenian parliament devoted to the conflict settlement process As the only senior official in either country who has been actively engaged in that process since the early 1990s Oskanian provided an overview of the OSCEs efforts to resolve the conflict which he subdivided into four stages Oskanian reiterated the three principles which Yerevan considers central to any formal solution that the unrecognized NKR not be vertically subordinated to the Azerbaijani central government which would rule out autonomous status but not a joint or federal state that the NKR should have an overland link with Armenia which would entail de facto recognition of Armenian control over the socalled Lachin corridor and that the security of the Armenian population of the NKR should be guaranteedAt the same time Oskanian made some statements that are in all likelihood unpalatable if not anathema to Baku He argued that the international community should abandon its insistence that the principle of territorial integrity which Azerbaijan consistently adduces as central to any settlement of the conflict should not automatically take precedence over the right to national selfdetermination In that context he cited the examples of East Timor and the ongoing discussion over the future status of Kosova independence for which could set a precedent for Karabakh He substantiated the argument in favor of selfdetermination for the NKR by pointing out as he has done on previous occasions that the region has never been part of an independent Azerbaijani state that it seceded legally from Azerbaijan in a referendum in September 1991 in accordance with the Soviet legislation in force at that time and that the Azerbaijani government has had no control whatsoever over the region for the past 15 years during which time democratization has made far deeper inroads in Karabakh than in Azerbaijan itself Finally he argued that by perpetrating violence against the Armenians of the NagornoKarabakh when the region was still formally a part of Azerbaijan Azerbaijan lost the moral right to hegemony over themMammadyarov too has new suggestions to air at his next meeting with Oskanian according to OSCE Chairman in Office Dmitrij Rupel who met with Armenian leaders in Yerevan on 30 March and in Baku with President Aliev and Mammadyarov two days later Also during his talks with Rupel Mammadyarov signaled a softening of Azerbaijans position on one key issue he admitted that sooner or later the Armenian community of the NKR should join in the ArmenianAzerbaijani talks on resolving the conflict because we cannot take any steps without them according to the independent ANS television station But Mammadyarov added We think we should continue the talks with Yerevan and achieve some results Previously Baku has ruled out the participation of the NKR in such talks unless the Azerbaijanis who fled the enclave in the late 1980s are also included

Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan a country with one of the highest levels of infant and maternal mortality in the world,Prague 7 April 2005 RFERL  Bibigula lives in Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan a country with one of the highest levels of infant and maternal mortality in the worldThere is not a home where there is not concern Bibigula told RFERLs Afghan Service Our neighbor who had three children became pregnant for the fourth time I was there during her delivery She was in bad condition After the delivery of the baby we were waiting for her placenta She had massive bleeding but we did not have a health center to visit She had retention of her placenta Her abdomen looked swollen Finally because of losing a lot of blood she closed her eyes forever and her innocent children lost their motherAlmost threequarters of all maternal deaths are caused by five factors  hemorrhaging infections unsafe abortions high blood pressure and obstructed laborSadly Bibigulas story is an everyday occurrence in most of the worlds developing countries  a fact borne out by the findings in the World Health Organizations World Health Report 2005 which was released todayThe statistics are staggeringJoy Phumaphi assistant directorgeneral of family and community health at the WHO calls it an epidemic with 11 million children under the age of 5 dying each year Mothers are also dying in numbers difficult to comprehendIt is absolutely unacceptable that as I speak to you today every minute we are losing a woman a young girl in childbirth and in pregnancy Phumaphi said It is equally unacceptable that every year we lose 4 million children before they reach the age of 28 days to preventable causesAs Phumaphi says most of these deaths are entirely preventable through common and affordable health practices and medicinesAlmost threequarters of all maternal deaths are caused by five factors  hemorrhaging infections unsafe abortions high blood pressure and obstructed labor The greatest threats to newborns include things such as low birth weight and birth trauma severe infections  such as pneumonia  and sicknesses including diarrheaThomson Prentice managing editor of the World Health Report 2005 says These are not necessarily complicated or serious conditions in the sense that there is no treatment or intervention possible There are many many treatments and interventions that can be applied at no great cost or without any great need for high technology that would make the difference between life and death for mother and childBut how much of an impact can a UN report really havePrentice believes the World Health Report 2005 can make a substantial difference in the way in which countries view the health of mothers and children But he acknowledges that the effects are longterm  that there wont be sudden visible changes in peoples health or even in the development of policies that would have rapid impacts Thats simply not the way governments tend to work he saysWhat we do know is that in previous reports the recommendations have been widely accepted around the world Many countries have made policy changes within their own health systems that take on board much of the information and advice that the report containsThe goal he says is for each country to adapt the reports recommendations to suit its particular health systemsThe WHO report strongly emphasizes the need for what it calls a continuum of care  providing support for women and children throughout the entire pregnancy cycle from the earliest stages through delivery and into those crucial hours days and weeks after birthWhat has been the case until now in many countries is there has been rather a compartmentalization of care Somebodys responsible for antenatal care for a woman but not particularly concerned with the birth of the child Somebodys concerned with the birth of a child but not much concerned with its later development and so onDoctor Wim Van Lerberghe is editor in chief of the new WHO study says the report classifies countries into four groups  those that are making good progress toward maternal and infant mortality goals those that are making slower progress those that are stagnating and those that had once made progress but are now in reversal Good progress are countries like Albania Armenia Croatia SerbiaMontenegro Macedonia  countries like that Countries that are making slower progress include Azerbaijan Bosnia Kyrgyzstan Latvia Lithuania Tajikistan Van Lerberghe says That means that child mortality is reducing but not as fast as in the preceding groupIran is considered to be making good progress while Russia Ukraine and Uzbekistan are classified as making slower progressAfghanistan is one of those countries that is stagnant  remaining at extremely high levels of maternal and infant mortality But the worst category Van Lerberghe says includes those places that at one time appeared to be making progress but are now slipping back  countries like Kazakhstan Turkmenistan and Iraq Top model Liya Kebede is the WHOs new goodwill ambassador for maternal newborn and child health She says she was shocked to learn that 500000 women die during pregnancy each year most of them from developing nations such as her own  EthiopiaThe sad fact is that they are largely ignored  a baby is buried a mother is mourned and a family grieves invisible to the rest of the world Kebede says It is inconceivable that in the early part of the 21st century mothers and children continue to die when solutions existThe WHO says the lives of more than 6 million children could be saved each year by a few simple steps such as vaccines and common treatments for serious illnesses These interventions are possible even in the poorest countries

from his forced exile in Russia this week,Prague 31 March 2005 RFERL  Kyrgyzstans deposed president had blunt advice from his forced exile in Russia this weekIn an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio Akaev was asked what he would counsel his fellow CIS presidents if they faced popular uprisings that threatened to topple their governments His answer Learn from my mistake use forceWhat lesson did I learn from the March 24 events Akaev said Our democracy is still weak and it cannot protect itself So I would advise my colleagues to protect democratic gains including with the use of force if neededIt is easy to see how Akaev might draw such a conclusion If the Georgian Ukrainian and Kyrgyz popular uprisings have one thing in common it is that they succeeded in part because massive force was not employed against unarmed demonstratorsThe key ingredients to a popular uprising seem to be clear a corrupt government that cannot distribute favors to enough people to maintain support perceived economic hardship and traces of democracy and partial freedom of the press  so that people become aware of the problemBut few observers believe violence would have stabilized the situation in any of these countriesIf a leader is confronted with the choice between fleeing and shooting his own people the situation has already spun out of control The more interesting question say analysts is how Akaev was backed into a corner  and whether his mistakes are being repeated by other leaders in the CIS making them vulnerableSergei Luzyanin of the Moscow Institute for International Relations MGIMO says Akaev made several cardinal mistakes that weakened his rule The first was to violate an unspoken powersharing agreement between representatives of the countrys northern and southern clans Akaev a northerner kept all the patronage posts for his northern alliesTraditionally especially at the local government level even back in the Soviet period there was a regular alternation between the northern and southern clans Luzyanin says Under Akaev this regular exchange was disrupted and the northern clan  Akaevs clan  controlled the southern regions and the southern clans were dissatisfied This is why Osh JalalAbad Batken blew up  because a feeling of social injustice has accumulated there during the 14 years of Akaevs rule The unspoken rule about the alternation between north and south which had always been observed was brokenAkaev went one step further gradually bringing his extended family into the political process Such nepotism came at the expense of even his northern political backers breeding resentment within his own bureaucracy This turned into his Achilles heel says Luzyanin as civil servants lost any sense of loyalty to the regimeThe civil servants all were saying Were against him But were biding our time and as soon as we see the first signal we will hand over our boss Which is exactly what happened says Luzyanin Seventy percent of government bureaucrats  including some very important ones  as soon as it became clear that Akaevs power was set to crumble immediately switched to the other side either by directly backing them or at least remaining neutral in relation to the oppositionThanks to a faltering economy aspects of a free press and the presence of nongovernmental organizations many Kyrgyz were aware of the situation and deeply dissatisfiedMurad Esenov editor of the Swedenbased Central Asia and the Caucasus journal says the fact that Kyrgyzstan  like Georgia and Ukraine  was relatively more democratic than other CIS countries speeded the demise of the regimeMany people think the Akaev regime fell very quickly but I dont share this opinion Esenov says You need to look at what came before recent events We know very well that in Kyrgyzstan nongovernmental organizations and a partially free media functioned and they had been criticizing the governments policies very harshly for a very long time Since the government wasnt doing a very good job public opinion against the government had already been formedThe key ingredients to a popular uprising seem to be clear a corrupt government that cannot distribute favors to enough people to maintain support perceived economic hardship and traces of democracy and partial freedom of the press  so that people become aware of the problemIn the case of Ukraine the economy was not failing But analysts say there was no trickledown effect Because of corruption few people sensed any improvement in their economic situation despite statisticsLastly rigged elections triggered public outcry in all three cases  Georgia Ukraine and KyrgyzstanIf there is one country in the CIS that best matches these criteria says Esenov it is arguably Kazakhstan Like the Kyrgyz president Kazakhstans leader Nursultan Nazarbaev has concentrated power in his extended family The Kyrgyz economy is doing well on paper but few people benefit And thanks to partial freedom of the press the Kyrgyz public is informed and opposition movements are growingIn Kazakhstan the people do have a certain amount of room to express their opinion Esenov says When people can express their opinions and the government has become mired in corruption naturally you get a situation such as the one we saw in Georgia and Ukraine and in KyrgyzstanIn Kazakhstan the opposition is stronger better organized and more united It is also true that the authorities are also more organized tougher and more motivated that the Akaev leadership  Sergei Luzyanin Moscow Institute for International RelationsLuzyanin agrees But he also says Nazarbaev has more at stake than Akaev That makes a confrontation with the opposition potentially more dangerousIn Kazakhstan the opposition is stronger better organized and more united Luzyanin says It is also true that the authorities are also more organized tougher and more motivated that the Akaev leadership Akaev was on his way out he was nearing the end of his term and he was not so motivated But its a different matter for Nazarbaev It is absolutely clear that an escalation of this political struggle will now shift to Kazakhstan And it will be more systematic and on a larger scale The ultimate results are not clear We cannot say that the opposition will triumph next year or at the end of this year But the fact that the political situation will heat up is clearSome people have also pointed to Azerbaijan as a possible candidate for unrest noting upcoming elections in November and previous clashes between the government and opposition But Esenov believes the economic situation in the country is less dire than in Central Asia making a revolution scenario less likelyIn Baku unlike in Georgia or Kyrgyzstan there is not the same degree of poverty Esenov says There is not the same level of unemployment These factors I believe make the prospect of a revolution in Baku more distant I dont think there will be a revolution in Baku in connection with the elections in November Although there is dissatisfaction undeniably it has not taken over society to an overwhelming degreeEsenov also says that unlike their Kazakh counterparts the Azerbaijani authorities have made a significant effort to coopt the nations young people and university students to keep them off the streetsIn Azerbaijan young people and students have been largely drawn into politics  but on the governments side he says For example the youth wing of the ruling party  Yeni Azerbaijan  has been very active The youth wing of the party is active in all institutions of higher learning They have meetings with students hold discussions even readings of President Heydar Alievs works They know that youth are the driving force of any revolution and this progovernment party is doing its utmost to coopt young people and bring them under their influence And I have not seen this in KazakhstanIf a countrys leader is unable to deliver tangible economic benefits to the people and wants to remain in power is the answer to clamp down on democratic movements The apparent stability of highly autocratic regimes in Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and Belarus would seem to indicate yesPopular dissatisfaction is subjective by nature so if people are not aware of alternatives they might continue to passively support a repressive regime But Luzyanin says this cannot continue over the long term and as with the former USSR apparent stability can be illusoryThese regimes are more stable But it does not mean that the system is strong he says The paradox is that the harsher the regime and the more it outwardly resembles a fortress the quicker it can collapse  all at once History knows many such examplesAs Ukraines Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko noted last week there will be other revolutions in the CIS When and where remains the big question But they will happen she and other successful revolutionaries believe

CIS has essentially fulfilled its function and should be radically reformed On 10 March apnru reported that National Strategy Institute Director Stanislav Belkovskii had called for burying the CIS and creating a new alliance of countries loyal to Moscow Belkovskii dubbed this alliance the USSR an acronym from the Russian words for Commonwealth of Countries Allied to Russia,Council for Foreign and Defense Policy Chairman Sergei Karaganov told RTR on 13 March that the CIS has essentially fulfilled its function and should be radically reformed On 10 March apnru reported that National Strategy Institute Director Stanislav Belkovskii had called for burying the CIS and creating a new alliance of countries loyal to Moscow Belkovskii dubbed this alliance the USSR an acronym from the Russian words for Commonwealth of Countries Allied to RussiaThe latest reflection of this new mindset in Russia was a proposed bill in the Duma that would have regulated the procedures for expanding the Russian Federation On 10 March Motherland Duma Deputy Andrei Savelev presented the bill on the creation of new constituents of the Russian Federation that would have amended a 2001 law on the Russian Federation see RFERL Newsline 3 December 2001 to facilitate the incorporation into Russia of the selfproclaimed republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia which are part of Georgia the Moldovan region of Transdniester and the NagornoKarabakh region of AzerbaijanNow is not the time to think about how to break up other states but to take care about the unity and sovereignty of our own countryUnder the 2001 law regions wishing to join the federation do not have to share borders with Russia but the consent of their present central governments is required for incorporation The law also stipulates that acceptance of new constituents of the federation must be approved by a referendum of the entire country In short the expansion of the Russian Federation requires an international treaty and a complete national domestic political processAccording to media reports the amendments submitted by Savelev were drafted by Motherland faction leader Dmitrii Rogozin They called for abolishing the requirement that expansion be accompanied by the consent of the foreign government involved Izvestiya reported on 10 March Instead the proposed amendments stated that admission to the federation would be based only on the will of the people of a region as expressed through a referendum or by the mass acceptance of Russian citizenship The only new condition that the amendments included was a provision that said the population of a candidate region must have voted positively on the 17 March 1991 referendum on the preservation of the USSR All of the regions listed above pass this standard a fact that Rogozin mentioned in a memorandum he attached to the bill In that message he wrote that Georgia Moldova and Azerbaijan have lately been intensifying efforts to project their sovereignty into the territories of these unrecognized republics while simultaneously accusing Russia of supporting separatismWhen presenting the bill in the Duma Savelev stressed that the proposals correspond with the Kremlins political line and its ideology of national revanche President Vladimir Putin said last year that we gave up too much and now we must get it all back Savelev said according to stranaru on 11 March We do not need a new Russia of Yeltsinites within the present borders but a genuine Russia with its imperial bordersThe Motherland bill however attracted just 91 votes  mainly from Motherland and its allies  of the 226 required for passage Thirtyfour deputies voted against the bill and one abstained with most deputies not participating in the vote The proKremlin Unified Russia party which controls more than 300 votes in the lower chamber declined to support the bill arguing that it could destroy the fragile balance of the territorial integrity of the Russian FederationUnified Russias position seems to follow the old dictum that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones Deputy Yurii Konev Unified Russia said The time for this law has passed Now is not the time to think about how to break up other states but to take care about the unity and sovereignty of our own country stranaru reported on 11 MarchKonevs concerns were echoed by Communist Deputy Leonid Ivanchenko whose faction largely supported the measure Ivanchenko however argued that the definition of a popular referendum in the bill works against Russias interests He noted that the Myasnikovskii Raion of Rostov Oblast which is in the district he represents has a compact Armenian community RTR reported on 12 March and that it could theoretically vote to secede from Russia First Deputy Duma Speaker Lyubov Slizka Unified Russia concluded the debate by saying that adoption of the bill will mean the de facto declaration of war against neighboring states whose territorial integrity will be violated She added that it would be another matter if one or another of these regions gained international recognition and then expressed the desire to join the Russian FederationIn an interview with Argumenty i fakty No 10 TVTsentr commentator Aleksei Pushkov whose statist views often reflect those of the Kremlin said that Moscow is afraid to encourage separatist claims in Georgia and Moldova because it faces the same problem in Chechnya Moreover if Moscow legitimizes the disintegration of Georgia and Moldova it could set off a chain reaction in Ukraine and Kazakhstan both of which have large ethnic Russian minorities concentrated in regions bordering Russia It seems that the Kremlin is seriously afraid of complications in our relations with our neighbors although as far as I can tell there is nothing to be afraid of Pushkov saidThe introduction of the bill in the Duma indicates that those in Russia who harbor imperialist ambitions are not yet ready to surrender despite the recent setbacks throughout the CIS After Moscows defeat in the Ukrainian presidential vote political consultant Marat Gelman who advised proMoscow presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych in the election there said that Russia should now give up its imperial project RosBalt reported on 29 December But although there is no chance of realizing any scenario of the restoration of the empire our wounded imperial consciousness remains and is posing a serious problem

another important step on the road toward closer alignment with the EU,Brussels 2 March 2005 RFERL  Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan have taken another important step on the road toward closer alignment with the EU On 2 March the European Commission adopted country reports on the three south Caucasus states as well as Lebanon and Egypt The reports are a detailed overview of the countries progress toward adopting EU values such as rule of law democracy and a market economyFrancoise Le Bail a Commission spokeswoman said the decision marks the completion of the first phase the EUs Neighborhood Policy  the blocs program to reach out to countries on its rimThese are measures within the framework of the neighborhood policy which is a policy directed at countries to the east of the enlarged European Union as well as the Mediterranean countries We have already adopted a certain number of country reports and action plans for some countries were therefore now completing this action with the country reports on five countriesLe Bail said that the completion puts the states on the way to obtaining their own EU neighbourhood action plan The action plans detail obligations on both sides for increased cooperation These are measures within the framework of the neighborhood policy which is a policy directed at countries to the east of the enlarged European Union as well as the Mediterranean countries Le Bail said We have already adopted a certain number of country reports and action plans for some countries were therefore now completing this action with the country reports on five countries And it is on the these country reports that the action plans  containing concrete measures for cooperation between these countries and the EU  will be basedThe EU neighborhood policy is directed at a ring of countries stretching from Morocco to Ukraine and Moldova Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan were initially excluded from the policy but were taken on board largely as a result of the Rose revolution in Georgia that took place in November 2003The three south Caucasus countries together with Lebanon and Egypt should have their action plans by the end of the year So far Israel Ukraine and Jordan have already signed theirs with Morocco Moldova the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia about to do soThe Commission has in recent months repeatedly stressed the neighborhood policy does not carry with it an EU commitment to eventually admit any of the beneficiary countries The clarifications have been partly sparked by pressure from Ukraine to be put on a fast track to EU membershipAnother Commission official who asked not to be named explained on 2 March that the action plans consist of what he called two basketsThe first basket contains conditions set by the EU  that is reforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law democracy and respect for human rights as well as certain foreign policy commitments such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism measures These the official said are all specific measures which the EU will closely measure The other basket contains the EU offer This could involve participation in EU programs policies and agencies approximation of national law with EU legislation to make cooperation and trade easier and opportunities for peopletopeople contactsThe further countries go with reforms the greater the degree of cooperation the EU will offer EU officials say that once the threeyear action plans have successfully run their course new and more extensive cooperation agreements may be offered The neighbourhood policy could lead to a nearcomplete integration in the EUs single market On 1 March RFERL spoke with Georgian Foreign Minister Salome Zurabishvili She welcomed the Commissions decision regarding her country but indicated it had been a long time coming We react very positively Zurabishvili said Weve been looking forward to that already for some time since our versions of the country reports were transmitted to the EU already in the fall of last year so weve been waiting for quite some time Georgia is seen by the EU as the most advanced nation in the region It hosts the only full European Commission mission There is a smaller regional mission in Yerevan which reports to the one in Tbilisi A similar smallscale mission will be launched this year in Baku Georgias country report is the least critical with relatively few problems identified when in comes to political reforms Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are criticized for deficient legislation breaches of fundamental freedoms and a general lack of willingness to reform The reports note widespread Russian influence on decisionmaking in both Armenia and Azerbaijan The EU has no immediate plans to become directly involved in helping resolve the regions socalled frozen conflicts However it is currently considering setting up a border monitoring mission in Georgia and has contributed funds to the economic rehabilitation of areas affected by conflict Commission officials say they are confident Russia will not react negatively to EU moves to engage the South Caucasus though they admit security cooperation in the exSoviet space is one of the most sensitive issues in EURussia attempts to agree a framework for their strategic partnershipOfficials in Brussels say the EU has made it very clear the bloc is not intent on weakening Russian

the recommendation on behalf of the Strasbourgbased assemblys political affairs committee urged his South Caucasus colleagues not to engage in sterile discussionsWe cannot go down this route Atkinson said Those who hark back to history are condemned to live in the past We have to move forward We must recognize the realities of todayIn Atkinsons words the realities of today are that  11 years after the 1994 truce that formally ended the Karabakh war  Azerbaijan remains technically at war with its secessionist regionA predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave of Soviet Azerbaijan Karabakh seceded in 1988 with Yerevans help Armenian forces gradually took control of the mountainous region before seizing a number of adjacent Azerbaijani administrative districts which they continue to occupyThe NagornoKarabakh conflict has claimed an estimated 35000 lives and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homesThe conflict has claimed an estimated 35000 lives and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homesAtkinson especially drew the assemblys attention to the plight of those civilians who despite the end of the war were still denied the right to return to their home regionsI was the PACE assemblys first rapporteur on the refugee situation when my report described the temporary shelters in both Armenia and Azerbaijan including dilapidated railway trucks outside the Armenian capital of Yerevan and appalling tent cities outside the Azerbaijani capital of Baku housing hundreds of thousands of displaced families Atkinson said Since then a timebomb generation of young refugees has grown up as in Palestine with nothing much to loseThe Armenian government was able to take care of nearly all of the refugees from Azerbaijan By contrast an estimated 600000 to 800000 internally displaced persons IDPs from Karabakh and Azerbaijan continue to live in makeshift camps abandoned railway cars and dugouts near Baku and other Azerbaijani cities and townsInternational aid agencies believe up to onethird of children of Azerbaijani IDPs suffer from malnutritionWhen Armenia and Azerbaijan joined the Council of Europe in January 2001 they both committed to seek a quick solution to their dispute But no breakthrough has been reached despite the mediation extended by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe through a small gathering of nations cochaired by France Russia and the United States  known as the Minsk GroupAzerbaijan has demanded that all ethnic Armenian forces withdraw from its territory as a prerequisite to any discussion on the status of its secessionist enclave Armenia which represents Karabakh in the peace talks has opposed Bakus stepbystep approach and insisted the fate of the breakaway region be settled simultaneously with all other issuesIgnoring protests raised by Armenias representatives the majority of PACE delegates today supported a demand made by Bulgarian parliamentarian Evgeni Kirilov that Azerbaijan be free of any occupying troopsWe should be clear once and for all and I think we are all behind this idea  there cannot be territories occupied by force or there cannot be any prospect of joining any territories by force to any country Kirilov said If we agree on this then we can build a way for a lasting peaceThe resolution adopted today calls on Azerbaijani authorities to establish contacts with Karabakh leaders  which they have persistently refused to do  and to refrain from any attempts to retake lost territory by force Nevertheless some Armenian delegates have blamed Atkinson for the resolutions alleged biasThis was notably the case of Armen Rustamian the deputy chair of the Armenian delegation and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation a nationalist political grouping also known as Dashnaktsutyun Addressing the Assembly in French Rustamian said he believes Atkinsons resolution would not only hinder the peace process but will also would serve as an incentive for Azerbaijan to forcefully restore its territorial integrityAzerbaijan is expecting to use this document as a justification to issue an ultimatum it has been preparing for a long time Rustamian said Azerbaijan wants to solve the Karabakh issue according to its own scenario  that is through warOf all nonArmenian delegates who attended todays debate only French parliamentarian Francois Rochebloine publicly questioned the impartiality of Atkinsons reportIt seems to me that for the sake of objectivity this report should have given a more balanced view of the position of the Armenian side and its readiness to negotiate Rochebloine saidOf particular concern to Armenias representatives is a sentence in the resolution that refers to the largescale ethnic expulsions that resulted from the Karabakh conflict and the creation of monoethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansingAlthough the document does not explicitly mention the massive exodus of Azerbaijani civilians during the years 1993 and 1994 some Armenian diaspora groupings have protested the wording of the resolutionIn a statement released on 23 January the Brusselsbased European Armenian Federation for Justice and Democracy  formerly known as the Armenian National Committee of Europe  described the draft document as the report of Azerbaijan It also called on European citizens to act through their Strasbourgbased representatives so that the text would be either withdrawn or rejectedThe Armenian government has so far not reacted to the Atkinson reportMedia reports quoted Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian as saying Yerevan would make its position public only after the document was voted upon

Foreign Minister Michel Barnier came after talks in Brussels with his counterparts from the 24 other European Union countries,Prague 14 December 2004 RFERL  The comments by French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier came after talks in Brussels with his counterparts from the 24 other European Union countries Barnier told reporters that France wants Ankara to reconsider its position on the mass killings of Ottoman Armenians at the start of the last century before it joins the EURegarding Armenia I mentioned the request that France will make during the negotiations with Turkey for a recognition of the tragedy that took place at the beginning of the last century and that concerned hundreds of thousands of Armenians Barnier saidIt was the first time a French government official publicly established a link between the Armenian atrocities and Turkeys EU aspirationsBarnier said France would file an official request with the Turkish government after the EU gives Ankara a date for the start of formal entry talksAnkaras membership bid will be reviewed at the EUs winter summit on 16 and 17 December in Brussels The bloc has already made it clear that it will give positive answersThis is an issue that we will raise during the negotiation process We will have about 10 years to do so and the Turks will have about 10 years to ponder their answer  French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier According to most Western estimates massacres and deportations between 1915 and 1923 claimed up to 15 million Armenian lives Another 200000 Armenians reportedly were killed between 1894 and 1896Most Western and Armenian scholars blame the nationalist Young Turk leaders that ruled over the Ottoman Empire during World War I for a deliberate policy of exterminationAlthough the successive governments that came to power after the creation of the Turkish Republic in 1923 deny any links with their Ottoman predecessors they have always refused to recognize the killings of Armenians as genocide Ankara insists the 15million death toll is inflated and says that if 300000 Armenians did die during those years this was largely the result of civil unrest that also claimed the lives of thousands of Turks Citing historical evidence Western and Armenian scholars in turn say the Young Turks sought to systematically deport and massacre the empires Armenian population partly in retaliation for its suspected collaboration with RussiaSince 1923 Turkey has resisted and condemned any attempt by foreign parliaments or governments to raise the Armenian genocide issueIn June 2001 the French parliament passed a cautiously worded bill that recognized the 19151923 killings of Ottoman Armenians as genocide Although the French government opposed the initiative President Jacques Chirac signed the bill into law This prompted a swift reaction from Ankara which threatened to sever economic and cultural ties with ParisTurkeys anger eventually abated after a few weeks and bilateral relations went back to normalUp until a parliamentary debate today Barnier was careful to not describe the 19151923 killings as genocide Still a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman immediately reacted to his initial comments saying his country would never recognize any socalled genocide Armenia which has put recognition of the genocide worldwide on its foreign policy agenda welcomed Frances positionSpeaking to reporters in Yerevan today Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said that Barniers remarks in Brussels show once again that the question of the genocide has gone beyond the Armenian framework and is now a global issueIn an interview with Reuters last week Oskanian said he hoped Turkey would change its stance on the genocide after it enters into talks with the EURegional experts say Ankaras attitude toward the Armenian issue is deeply rooted in Turkeys educational system which glosses over the countrys cultural diversity in a bid to promote a unifying Turkish national identityHowever Barnier said that in Frances view Ankara cannot aspire to EU membership if it refuses to come in terms with its pastIf as I think the core idea of Europes project is that all its members should reconcile one with another  like France and Germany which have put reconciliation at the center of their project  and that each member state should reconcile with its own past then I believe that when the time comes Turkey too will have to come in terms with its own past and history and recognize this tragedy Barnier saidIn comments on France 2 public television today the foreign minister reiterated that Paris is not making this a condition for the opening of entry talks with the EU Barnier said that would not be legally possibleThis is an issue that we will raise during the negotiation process We will have about 10 years to do so and the Turks will have about 10 years to ponder their answer It is not a condition were making for the opening of negotiations that will be discussed by EU leaders this coming Thursday and Friday Barnier saidResults of an opinion survey released today by the Parisbased French Institute of Public Opinion IFOP show a majority of citizens in France and Germany remain opposed to Turkeys entry into the EU Those who object to Ankaras accession cite its human rights record its cultural and religious differences with European countries and the status of women in Turkish societyHowever they make no mention of the Armenian issue

discussion at a meeting on 15 September between the two countries presidents Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of a CIS summit in Astana after which Oskanian said there would be an interval before the second stage of his talks with Mammadyarov began Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov said in late September that the past meetings with Oskanian had proved useful but that further such talks had been postponed indefinitely at Armenias request No details have been divulged of the issues on the table in Prague and that enforced confidentiality has spawned rumors that Yerevan is prepared to withdraw from either three or five of the seven occupied Azerbaijani districts bordering on Karabakh even before a final decision is reached on the future political status of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh RepublicOn 27 October the Armenian Foreign Ministry issued a formal statement denying such speculation Regardless of Azerbaijans wishes or statements Armenias focus during negotiations is on the issue of the status of NagornoKarabakh All other issues are tangential to the status issue and Armenia views them only in the context of the future status of NagornoKarabakh the statement said It further underscored that Yerevan is interested only in a comprehensive resolution of this issue and its participation in negotiations is conditional on that approach the statement continued In other words Armenia wants the final agreement on a solution to the conflict to address and stipulate a solution to all disputed issues and to specify the order and time frame in which the various points agreed upon will be implementedAlso in his 9 November interview with RFERLs Armenian Service Oskanian criticized as a diplomatic error Bakus insistence on including on the agenda of the UN General Assembly the issue of the resettlement of Armenian families on territory controlled by Armenian forces He warned that Azerbaijan should not proceed on the assumption that it can continue negotiations on resolving the Karabakh conflict under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE Minsk Group while at the same time seeking the assistance of other international organizations in resolving individual issues related to that conflict Armenia wants the final agreement on a solution to the conflict to address and stipulate a solution to all disputed issues and to specify the order and time frame in which the various points agreed upon will be implementedEither we continue the negotiations within the Minsk Group trying to reach a solution of the whole problem or Azerbaijan can take the issue to other instances seeking separate solutions Oskanian said Should Azerbaijan choose the latter approach Oskanian said the Azerbaijani authorities will have to negotiate with the NagornoKarabakh leadership Today the ball is in Azerbaijans court Oskanian concluded But on 10 November Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Metin Mirza rejected Oskanians warning that Azerbaijan should not try to launch a parallel mediation effort as an effort to torpedo the negotiating process at a juncture when favorable conditions had been created for making progress He inferred that Yerevan is seriously concerned by the prospect of the UN General Assembly debate And he stressed yet again that Baku will not agree to negotiate with the NagornoKarabakh leadership President Aliyev similarly argued last week that raising the Karabakh issue in other international forums will not jeopardize the ongoing search for a solution under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk Group nor does Baku seek to replace the Minsk Group by another mediator ITARTASS reported Aliyev said Baku simply wants international organizations such as the UN the EU and the Council of Europe to recognize unequivocally that Armenia has occupied part of Azerbaijans territory and that this unfair situation should be corrected Touring four southern regions of Azerbaijan on 9 November President Aliyev said that Baku will not sign a formal Karabakh peace agreement until Armenian forces have retreated from the districts adjacent to NagornoKarabakh that they currently occupy ITARTASS reported We demand with justification that the seized territory be freed and the occupying forces withdraw Aliyev said while visiting Astara where he formally

World Food Program WFP has decided to reduce food rations for tens of thousands of internally displaced persons IDPs in Azerbaijan,Prague 15 October 2004 RFERL  The United Nations World Food Program WFP has decided to reduce food rations for tens of thousands of internally displaced persons IDPs in AzerbaijanThe agency says it is still looking for almost half of the money it needs to finance a threeyear operation that started in January 2003 Donations collected so far from the United States Japan Luxembourg Denmark the Netherlands Norway Sweden and Switzerland amount to only 11 millionRahman Chowdhury who is the WFPs country director in Azerbaijan told RFERL that both financial constraints and a shortage of food supplies are responsible for the decision to cut assistance to Azerbaijans IDPs We have not received enough food during the last couple of months and our incountry stocks of food commodities are such that we cannot provide rations to all the IDPs that we are assisting now he said So we decided that we would halve the rations of wheat flour and that rations for other commodities  such as sugar and oil  would remain as they areUp until now WFP food rations amounted to 6 kilograms per person per monthThere has been no official reaction from Baku In private however government officials lament the WFPs decision saying the UN program should continue running in full until all IDPs are able to return homeAzerbaijan witnessed the largest forced migrations that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet UnionFirst came thousands of Azeri refugees from Armenia as tensions between Yerevan and Baku flared up in the late 1980s Later after Armenian separatists took control of Azerbaijans NagornoKarabakh enclave tens of thousands of Azeris were forced to move into areas controlled by Baku Joined by tens of thousands more Azeris Kurds and others they were later forced farther into exile as Armenian troops pushed east progressively occupying Azerbaijani territories bordering Karabakh As the Russian Army gradually broadened its operations to reassert Moscows control over Chechnya thousands more civilians fled the breakaway republic through Daghestan and sought refuge in AzerbaijanBakubased nongovernmental organizations believe the Karabakh war has driven an estimated 800000 people into exile  roughly one10th of Azerbaijans current population In addition they say some 70000 refugees from Chechnya Central Asia Iran Afghanistan and Iraq have found shelter in the country in recent years The Karabakh conflict was suspended in 1994 Yet Azerbaijans IDPs cannot return to Armenianoccupied territories and have been living in the same wretched conditions for the past 10 years The 10 monthly stipend they receive from the government does little to improve their situationIn the makeshift camps that surround the central towns of Saatli and Sabirabad families are crammed into oneroom mudbrick huts Elsewhere people live in abandoned railway wagons and dugouts About onethird of children of IDPs reportedly suffer from malnutrition Chowdhury said the WFPs decision to halve food rations may have serious implications The consequences are quite tough because the winter is coming and that will aggravate their hardships in the coming months he said We are aware of this but because we dont have enough food commodities and because we didnt get enough contributions from our donor countries in the last three months we had to resort to this measureThe UN food agency is only assisting 145000 IDPs it considers most in need and is not dealing with Azerbaijans refugees Vusal Rajabli is president of Hayat Life a Bakubased NGO that provides humanitarian aid to refugees and IDPs across Azerbaijan He said refugees are much more vulnerable than IDPs because unlike the latter they depend almost exclusively on foreign aid Unfortunately the assistance the government offers refugees is scarce  I would even say it is extremely small It covers only 5 to 10 percent of their needs The government says it has just enough resources to take care of its internal refugees Therefore all the government can afford goes to IDPs This makes the situation of refugees much much worse Refugees are taken care of by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and our organization in partnership The UNHCR offers them financial support giving each family that meets its criteria between 60 and 80 per month But those families represent only 30 percent of all refugees Rajabli saidMost refugees live in appalling conditions squatting in deserted buildings or  for those who get financial help from the UNHCR  spending their meager subsidies on rooms or small apartments that have neither heat nor running waterTo add to their hardship Rajabli said most immigrants live in administrative limbo and are scarcely protected by the temporary refugee status offered by the UNHCR Most refugees live how they can and where they can because the government does not help them find a roof he said It must be said in its defense though that there is not a single free public building not a single free dormitory left because the IDPs have occupied all of them Yet the government does not allocate any funds to build temporary refugee campsAnother problem facing refugees who arrived after the breakup of the Soviet Union is the reluctance of Azerbaijani officials to consider their applications for citizenship I havent heard of many cases when those refugees managed to obtain citizenship Rajabli said I would say they are 10 or 15 at most But even these estimates are questionable

doubledigit rate last year living standards have not improved in Armenia Instead a highly uneven distribution of wealth has widened the gap between the rich and poor Poverty still affects about half of the countrys population Its most extreme manifestation homelessness was virtually nonexistent in the past but can now be seen on the streets of YerevanYerevan 7 October 2004 RFERL  For a man who has been homeless for almost 15 years Vartan is remarkably healthconscious Every morning he jogs in a park and eats two raw eggs afterwardThat says the 41yearold university graduate is American movie icon Arnold Schwarzeneggers recipe for fitness and good health I havent taken any medicine for 15 years No drugs at allThis statement seems more of a rebuke to Armenias government than bravado Vartans sole contact with the government is periodical encounters with police officers who he says dont like to see him and his friends living on the street I sold my apartment divorced my wife and now live on the street But they must somehow take care of me Instead they come and beat me up We are not their slaves are weLongterm homelessness has dimmed the sense of time for Vartans Ukrainianborn girlfriend Tatyana She is not sure how old she is I must be at least 46 Tatyana says smilingThe couple had accommodation only last winter when they rented a room with proceeds from the collection of empty bottles and scrap metal Their usual workplace is the area around a small agricultural market in Yerevans northern Arabkir District Traders there give them fruit vegetables and even meatHomeless people like Vartan and Tatyana form the most underprivileged class of Armenians still reeling from the collapse of the Soviet command economy Their number may not be large given the scale of poverty in the country But it seems to have increased in recent years despite higher economic growth which has seemingly done more to increase income disparities than to reduce povertyEleonora Manandian is the chairwoman of New Armenia The youth organization engages in social work mainly by helping to get children begging in the streets back to school She warns that prolonged poverty is eroding Armenians traditionally strong family bonds  ties that have helped cushion postSoviet hardship You may not see many homeless people on the streets But the number of marginalized people keeps growing because social bonds are increasingly weakening That is people stop feeling like citizens  fullfledged members of the society And there will come a moment when they find themselves outside that societyThe social polarization is particularly eyecatching in Yerevan Its glitzy center filled with restaurants and luxury cars increasingly contrasts with its rundown suburbs Real estate prices

visited or offered her any assistanceIn fact neither Armenias Ministry of Social Affairs nor any other government agency has programs specifically for the countrys homelessAccording to government statistics the proportion of the population living below the official poverty line declined from almost 50 percent to 43 percent last year due to an almost 14 percent surge in Armenias Gross Domestic Product The government says the robust growth continued into the first half of this yearHowever little suggests that it has improved the lot of the 13 percent of Armenians officially considered to be living in extreme poverty It is still not clear how they might benefit from a government povertyreduction program launched a year ago with the blessing of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund The program seeks to bring the poverty rate to 19 percent by 2015 through job creation and increased public spending The government plans to spend 6 million in 2006 to provide families lacking adequate housing with new homes Sources in the Western donor community say the modest scheme has been recently narrowed to only Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan This is bad news for thousands of people huddling in former factory hostels that lack basic amenities such as running water and toilets Many of them fit into the Western definition of homelessnessThis is particularly true for the dozens of poor families squatting in a ramshackle buildings in the southern outskirts of Yerevan Once dotted with big factories the area is now an industrial graveyard Last year people started moving

officers of ArmeniaSince January Baku has sought repeatedly to thwart the planned Armenian presence at this years Cooperative Best Effort maneuvers Three Armenian military officers who tried to travel to Baku in early January first from Turkey and then from Georgia to attend a planning conference for the maneuvers were prevented from doing so In June members of the radical Karabakh Liberation Organization QAT picketed and then forced their way into a Baku hotel where two Armenian officers were attending a second planning conference in preparation for the exercises Five of those QAT activists were arrested and sentenced in late August to between three and five years imprisonment on charges of hooliganism violating public order and obstructing government officials Those verdicts triggered protests from across the political spectrum fueling public opposition to the Armenians anticipated arrivalIn April Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev assured Deputy Commander of the US European Command General Charles Wald that there were no obstacles to the Armenian participation in the September war games Other visiting US officials also sought to impress on Azerbaijan the importance of allowing the Armenian contingent to attend But in recent weeks the Azerbaijani government has made increasingly clear its hostility to the planned Armenian participation On 27 July the independent ANS TV quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov as saying that Baku has stipulated that only noncombat personnel  military journalists publicrelations officials and military doctors  would be permitted to attend and that the number of Armenian participants would be limited to three On 4 September however Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Major General Artur Aghabekian said seven Armenian officers would take part in the exercises while the number denied visas by the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tbilisi was given as fiveOn 10 September the Azerbaijani parliament adopted an appeal to

NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to retract the invitation extended to the Armenian side citing what it termed Armenias aggression and policy of ethnic cleansing The parliamentarians argued that the presence in Baku of Armenian military personnel could aggravate tensions in the region President Aliyev stated while visiting the Barda region on 11 September I do not want the Armenians to come to AzerbaijanIn an apparent lastditch effort to persuade Baku to abandon its obstructionist approach de Hoop Scheffer summoned Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian to Brussels on 13 September for talks Oskanian subsequently praised the NATO decision to call off the exercises adding at the same time that he regrets the lost opportunity for regional cooperationArmenia hosted the NATO Cooperative Best Effort2003 exercises in which some 400 troops from 19 countries including the United States the United Kingdom Russia Georgia and Turkey practiced routine peacekeeping exercises Azerbaijan declined to participate In February 2004 a junior Azerbaijani officer attending a NATOsponsored English language course in Budapest hacked a sleeping Armenian fellow student to death with an axeThe full impact of Azerbaijans violation of NATOs principle of inclusiveness and of NATOs ensuing decision to cancel the planned exercises is difficult to predict The move is likely to corroborate many Azerbaijanis conviction that NATO is guilty of double standards and bias toward Armenia It may also give rise to a certain coolness between Brussels and Washington in light of persistent rumors that the United States is considering Azerbaijan as a possible location for a rapidreaction force Certainly the prediction by one Western analyst that Azerbaijan will enter NATO by 2005 which made headlines in the Azerbaijani press in July 2002 now seems somewhat overoptimistic

and impermissible and as intended to force Azerbaijan to come to terms with the loss of part of its territoryIn an interview with zerkaloaz published one week earlier Guluzade had said that any country whose territory is occupied but which fails to prepare for a war of reconquest should be regarded as criminal He also suggested that both the US and the West Europeans have failed completely to grasp the essence of the Karabakh conflict otherwise they would realize the futility of trying to get Azerbaijan to reconcile itself to the loss of its territories In addition Guluzade disclosed that during his tenure as President Aliyevs adviser we discussed all variants for resolving the conflict and they were all stillborn Baku immediately rejected them as every single peace proposal unveiled to date entailed the loss of NagornoKarabakh Guluzade saidAny country whose territory is occupied but which fails to prepare for a war of reconquest should be regarded as criminalAzerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov by contrast opined in a 28 July interview with zerkaloaz that a new war is not the optimum way to resolve the conflict But at the same time he implied that any compromise should come from Yerevan A sensible compromise with the Armenian side can be reached only if Armenia publicly renounces the idea of independence for NagornoKarabakh Mammadyarov said In that interview Mammadyarov said he believes that each of the cochairs France Russia and the US seeks to promote its own interests in the South Caucasus Several days earlier however he sought to imply that Washington does understand that many Azerbaijanis categorically reject the prospect of the loss of sovereignty over NagornoKarabakh Mammadyarov was quoted by zerkaloaz on 22 July as saying that during his talks the previous week in Washington with US officials US Secretary of State Colin Powell noted that it is imperative to take public opinion into account when drafting a settlement proposal The online daily further quoted Mammadyarov as saying that it is not realistic to speak of resolving the conflict until the displaced persons who fled during the fighting in 19921993 have returned to their homes It is not clear however whether by this Mammadyarov is advocating a phased approach to a settlement or whether Baku would accept a package solution in which repatriation preceded the announcement of NagornoKarabakhs future statusFinally Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev told members of his countrys diplomatic service on 27 July that if the path of negotiations leads us nowhere Azerbaijan will use all other means available including the military option Turan reported Referring to the OSCE Minsk Group cochairs calls for compromise Aliyev said no compromises can be made over Azerbaijans territorial integrity Aliyev has made similar statements on numerous occasions in recent months most recently on a tour last week of northern districts of Azerbaijan Both Mammadyarov and Aliyev stressed that international law favors Azerbaijan which is the victim of Armenian aggression and the territory of which is partially occupiedThe Armenian Foreign Ministry reacted sharply to Aliyevs 27 July statement RFERLs Armenian Service reported on 28 July Spokesman Hamlet Gasparian said Aliyevs comments show that Azerbaijan has no desire to settle the Karabakh conflict by peaceful means and is laying its hopes on a solution by force He warned that the latter course of action would have disastrous consequences for AzerbaijanMeanwhile the US Minsk Group cochairman Ambassador Steven Mann told Russias Regnum news agency that he understands that the leaders of both Armenia and Azerbaijan are in a difficult position because passions are running high on both sides But at the same time he argued that the two presidents should eschew emotion and try to reach a compromise On 28 July zerkaloaz quoted John Ordway the outgoing US ambassador to Yerevan as urging that the conflict be resolved as soon as possible The paper quoted him as saying that the status quo is acceptable to the US only as the sole alternative to the beginning of hostilities and as expressing the hope that a settlement could be reached next year That proposed timeframe prompted Azerbaijani commentator Rauf Mirkadyrov to conclude that Washington is trying to strongarm Baku into a settlement lest the commissioning of the BakuTbilisiCeyhan oil pipeline now tentatively scheduled for the summer of 2005 be jeopardized by a resumption of hostilities

transitional politics in Armenia Azerbaijan and GeorgiaBut for this week at least Stepan Demirchian Ali Kerimli and Davit Gamkrelidze were content to sit on the sidelines and observe the opposition party convention in Boston Demirchian Kerimli and Gamkrelidze were among hundreds of diplomats politicians and political activists attending the convention as guests of the National Democratic Institute for International AffairsIn separate interviews with RFERL the three politicians said the convention held useful lessons for their own countries difficult reform paths They also gained insight into the foreign policy priorities of key advisers to Democratic presidential candidate John KerryKerimli is chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Partys AHCP reformist wing and is a lead figure in attempts to reunite the fragmented Azerbaijani opposition He said beyond the stagecraft on view in Boston he saw the convention as an important confidenceboosting exercise for the opposition Democratic PartyThe convention is orchestrated as a big show there are a large number of participants they use the stage for propaganda Kerimli said The convention itself does not decide anything because all decisions have already been taken The convention simply illustrates the will of the candidate to win the presentation of his team of his program  this was of particular interest to meGamkrelidze is chairman of the New Conservative Party formerly the New Rightists Party of Georgia  the only opposition party in that countrys parliament He said the convention provided a useful model for organizing an effective campaign He said it highlighted the importance of welltrained activists and volunteers who are the foot soldiers of major US partiesDavit Gamkrelidze said the convention demonstrated some of the strengths of multiparty democracy which he said Georgia lacksGamkrelidze said the convention demonstrated some of the strengths of multiparty democracy which he said Georgia lacksThis balance  balance between the Republicans and Democrats  is first of all a huge benefit for the citizens of the United States and when you dont have this balance it means that the government and ruling party they lose control over themselves and its very dangerous and we already have found out in Georgia that the government and the new leaders in the Georgian state they somehow lost control over themselves Gamkrelidze saidFor Demirchian leader of the Justice Faction in the National Assembly of Armenia HZhK the US convention has helped illustrate how far his country must travel on its path to democracy We have to learn a lot So democracy needs consistent work Hard work Demirchian saidDemirchian lost to President Robert Kocharian in a 2003 presidential runoff He and other opposition leaders have alleged that Kocharian falsified that vote and led protests this spring demanding the president either organize a national referendum of confidence on his rule or step downDemirchian Kerimli and Gamkrelidze were eager to hear any mention of Democratic Party policy on issues such as NagornoKarabakh and Russias role in the South Caucasus But most speeches and panel discussions focused on Iraq the Middle East and the Democrats strategy for waging the war against international terrorismKerimli said after a briefing given by top Kerry foreignpolicy advisers that the Democrats favor greater engagement with allies and multilateral institutionsAmerica has now to make a very important choice  how it will continue to be the leader in the world Kerimli said Of course America does have a leadership role but the question is how this role will be put to use and how this role will be implemented  together with the world or alone The Democratic Convention shows an inclination toward solving the problems in participation with all international organizationsGamkrelidze sensed little difference in the main foreign policy goals of US Democrats and RepublicansIts my impression there are not big differences between the two parties first of all about the security about the war against terror also such things as values and spreading of the values Its good for me because its always dangerous when there is a big shift Gamkrelidze saidThe three politicians were among participants from more than 120 countries who came to Boston under the sponsorship of the National Democratic Institute It was believed to be the largest group of foreign observers ever to attend a US electoral conventionThe institute a nonprofit organization aims to establish political

on 3 July and bears the imprimatur of the Russian presidential press service charged that the OSCE does not respect such fundamentalprinciplesas noninterference in internal affairs and respect for national sovereignty and that it is guilty of double standards by focusing selective attention on certain states while ignoring problems in other states It claimed that the OSCEs humanitarian activities are restricted to monitoring the human rights situation in the countries of the CIS and former Yugoslavia and that this almost exclusive focus on the human rights dimension significantly restricts its ability to counter new challenges and threats,The statement which was adopted during a meeting of CIS heads of state in Moscow on 3 July and bears the imprimatur of the Russian presidential press service charged that the OSCE does not respect such fundamentalprinciplesas noninterference in internal affairs and respect for national sovereignty and that it is guilty of double standards by focusing selective attention on certain states while ignoring problems in other states It claimed that the OSCEs humanitarian activities are restricted to monitoring the human rights situation in the countries of the CIS and former Yugoslavia and that this almost exclusive focus on the human rights dimension significantly restricts its ability to counter new challenges and threatsThe statement further targeted the OSCEs Warsawbased Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ODIHR noting that its primary activity of election monitoring is frequently politicized and fails to take into account the specifics of individual countries Over the past decade ODIHR monitoring missions have criticized as failing to meet European standards most of the ballots both parliamentary and presidential in all the nine states that signed the condemnationThe joint statement also criticized as ineffective the OSCEs field missions in the CIS noting that their financing consumes a significant chunk of the OSCEs budget It claimed that instead of fulfilling their mandate to provide assistance to the government of the host state those missions concentrate exclusively on the human rights situation and engage in unwarranted criticism of the domestic political situationIt concluded that the OSCEs agenda should include the swiftest removal of the imbalance between the three dimensions of the organizations activity by increasing the role of its militarypolitical economic and environmental elements and called for drafting new approaches to the organizations workSpeaking in Moscow on 8 July Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Chizhov warned that Russia and other CIS states might lose all interest in the OSCE if it continues to degenerate rather than reformThis is by no means the first time that Russia has criticized the OSCE for allegedly neglecting the security aspect of its original mandate Exactly 10 years ago in July 1994 thenRussian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev formally proposed that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe CSCE as it was then called should assume the role of an umbrella organization with overall responsibility for coordinating security in Europe in cooperation with NATO the West European Union and the Council of Europe A Russian Foreign Ministry official told Interfax on 20 July 1994 that other CIS states supported that Russian proposal A Russian parliamentarian said the Russian proposal was prompted by NATOs shortcomings specifically with regard to peacekeeping He said NATOs Partnership for Peace program launched earlier that year is an interesting forum for cooperation in military training and joint exercises but it does notguarantee security in Europe But the underlying Russian rationale was clearly concern at the prospect of NATO expansion to incorporate one or more of the former Warsaw Pact countriesAt its summit in Budapest in December 1994 the CSCE changed its name to reflect its enlarged membership and shifting priorities in the wake of the collapse first of socialism in Eastern Europe and then of the USSR But Russian politicians continued to lobby persistently for enhancing the OSCEs security component and specifically for the adoption of a new European security charter Addressing a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers in Copenhagen in December 1997 thenRussian Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov argued that the OSCE should be the appropriate framework for the reinforcement of panEuropean security At the same time he urged that the proposed OSCE charter should not mandate interference into the domestic affairs of member statesThe new OSCE security charter was finally adopted at the Istanbul OSCE summit in November 1999 It outlined intended new steps including enhancing the focus on security expanding the OSCEs role in peacekeeping and the need to counter the growing threats of terrorism extremism and drug trafficking It also stresses the potential threat to regional security posed by acute economic problems and the degradation of the environment By that time however it was already clear that Russia was losing the battle to forestall NATOs expansion eastwards the Czech Republic Poland and Hungary were formally admitted to the alliance at its Washington summit in April 1999 and seven more countries Estonia Latvia Lithuania Bulgaria Romania Slovakia and Slovenia were to follow suit in early 2004Russia nonetheless persisted in its criticisms of the OSCE In June 2000 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgenii Gusarev complained that unnamed Western countries were trying to narrow the OSCEs focus to human rights issues in the former East Bloc He said such efforts would reduce the OSCE to nothing and warned that Russia will do everything to prevent this In January 2001 Russian diplomats presented to OSCE SecretaryGeneral Jan Kubis proposals for reforming the OSCE which met with a lukewarm receptionThe most recent Russian broadside against the OSCE came just days after the NATO summit in Istanbul failed to designate any CIS states as potential candidates for a future round of NATO expansion Instead the final communique signed at the summit stressed the importance of enhanced cooperation and closer partnership between NATO and the states of the South Caucasus and Central Asia and also Ukraine The question therefore arises is Russia trying to persuade its CIS allies that in light of NATOs increased geographical focus on outofarea operations such as its engagement in Afghanistan on the one hand and its reluctance to designate any CIS states as potential future members on the other a revamped OSCE could guarantee European security just as effectivelyIt should be noted that of the four CIS states Azerbaijan Georgia Ukraine and Uzbekistan that have made clear their aspiration to join NATO two Georgia and Azerbaijan declined to sign the joint statement criticizing the OSCE Turan on 10 July quoted a spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry as saying that Baku had proposed an alternative draft statement that contained the accusation of double standards but also arguing that the OSCEs primary mandate is conflict prevention and mediation specifically averting ethnic cleansing and the occupation of the territory of sovereign states Ukraine and Uzbekistan by contrast endorsed

Iraq is that it has managed to keep its language alive and maintain strong solidarity He says the community never leaves its members in trouble Gladys Boghossian is the president of the Armenian Womens Association for the Relief of the Poor in Iraq an organization that works closely with the Armenian Apostolic Church The association was founded in 1927Boghossian says the numbers of those in need in Iraq is greater now than ever before Now we have too much work to do because of this war We started to give them food and medical treatmentShe says the association is taking care of some 300 families  almost 1000 people Among the benefits Boghossian notes that every poor Armenian can get free medicine in pharmacies serving the community Eglantine Simon Geloian works for the association She says that when her own family was in need it received significant assistance from the associationWe are a very poor family she said The church has provided work for my husband He works in the church Not only me  any person who asks the church for help is given help The church never hesitates to give helpOn the surface life in the ethnic Armenian community in postwar Iraq seems fairly comfortable However some members of the community  speaking on condition of anonymity  say it is only a facade that hides deep divisionsThey say some Armenians cooperated with the former regime and lost trust among the people but remain in leading positions Armenians in Iraq also bitterly accuse their leaders of corruption especially in dealing with financial help coming from abroad

https://www.rferl.org/a/1053639.html,Western Press Review Husseins Day In Court The Search For Karadzic And Targeted Assassinations ,"July 01, 2004 14:12 GMT",THE NEW YORK TIMES,THE NEW YORK TIMESIn Saddam Husseins Iraq fear death and vengeance were the only laws of the land says an editorial in the New York daily A new Iraq must be built on more solid foundations democracy and the rule of law And one of the first challenges will be bringing its former leader Saddam Hussein to justice The paper says Hussein should have a fair trial under an elected government applying the relevant principles of Iraqi and international lawIraqs former president will be formally charged today along with 11 of his top officials before a tribunal established in December by the USled Iraqi Governing Council The court is headed by Salem Chalabi the nephew of Iraqi exile Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress The paper says proper trials will take several months and offer the opportunity to unravel the mysteries and crimes of the Baathist era including the secret mass graves and the true story of unconventional weapons programs But the proceedings should not begin until an elected Iraqi government takes power in January To begin the trials before holding elections would not serve justice or help restore Iraqs standing in the international communityAs of today the 12 accused men will officially be criminal defendants under the legal authority of Iraqs interim government And as legal defendants the paper says they must have the rights that go with their new legal status including the chance to consult with their lawyers and safeguards against abusive interrogationsThe new Iraq should be a country where the rule of law applies impartially to allTHE INDEPENDENTThe Londonbased daily says the image of Saddam Hussein in court in shackles and under guard will be the most potent symbol that the regime in Iraq has changedAnd both US and Iraqi authorities can be expected to use this symbol to full advantage If this public relations exercise can help to convince the people of Iraq that there is hope for the future and so reduce the carnage on the streets then so much the better the paper says But Husseins day in court should not blind us to the perilous situation that remains in IraqHis trial will be a vital part of banishing the past and laying the foundations of the new state But many decisive questions such as whether Hussein should face the death penalty if convicted should be left up to the elected government that will emerge from Januarys elections For now the best that can probably be hoped for is that the proceedings should have international jurists as observers and be conducted to internationally recognized standards There might be some pressure from the families of those who fell victim to Saddams regime and from the many who felt the harshness of his rule themselves to press for more summary justice Any resort to the lynch mob however must be resistedThe Independent writes How Saddam Hussein is treated will say much about the sort of state that Iraq is likely to become Punctilious observance of judicial proprieties would be the best augury for a stable and lawgoverned Iraq in the future THE TIMESThe impact of this event in Iraq will be huge says the London daily The effect in the wider Middle East a region where dictators are rarely deposed nevermind held to account could be extraordinary How the trial of Saddam Hussein moves ahead will do much to shape the image of Iraqs new government in the international community and will be as significant as his fall 15 months ago or his capture last December The paper lauds the fact that it is an Iraqi court that will hear Husseins case rather than the international tribunal at The Hague which could have allowed the case to drag on for years and provided a propaganda platform for the defendant And The Times says fears that the former Iraqi leader would receive hasty justice motivated by revenge have been misguided Saddam Hussein was properly made aware of his rights yesterday and he will acquire legal representation for his defense These are the actions of serious people determined to be seen as acting correctly especially as a death penalty is highly likely Bringing the case against Hussein will not be easy the paper says Most people believe Hussein was aware of the torture and murder of his political opponents the 1988 gassing of the Kurds in Halabja the launch of the IranIraq war the 1990 invasion of Kuwait or the slaughter of thousands of Shia after their uprising the following year But even from the 30 tons of documentation to be reviewed producing the proper evidence with the necessary political fingerprints and convincing witnesses will prove a challengeThe paper also calls for the trial to be as open as possible including allowing television cameras into the courtroom Every moment should be carried live and there must be no perception of censorship THE IRISH TIMESThe Dublinbased dailys Chris Stephen discusses the sacking yesterday of 60 Bosnian Serb officials as punishment for their failure to locate and apprehend former Serbian leader and indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic Stephen calls the move by Paddy Ashdown the top international administrator in the country the most drastic action yet taken by Western officials against Bosnias former warring factions since the end of war in 1995Ashdowns frustration is shared far to the north in The Hague where prosecutors have had to revise their optimistic assessment from the beginning of June that Karadzic could be in custody by the end of the month The fact that Karadzic  whom Stephen calls the bouffanthaired former poet who led the Bosnian Serbs to war in 1992  remains a free man is a major embarrassment for the international community When the civil war following the breakup of Yugoslavia ended NATO forces in Bosnia refused to arrest him and he lived openly in a villa 20 minutes from the NATO headquarters When NATOs policy changed in 1997 and war crimes arrests began Karadzic vanished He has been missing ever sinceSeveral attempts by NATO commandos to apprehend Karadzic have failed and Stephen says with the NATO force now only 7000 strong in Bosnia the chance may have been missedTHE MOSCOW TIMESAn editorial in Moscows Englishlanguage daily considers the thorny issue of targeted assassinationsEntire theses could be written on whether extrajudicial execution of suspected terrorist leaders can be justified in legal terms says the paper But these arguments do not answer a vital question about the effectiveness of assassinations of leaders of radical Islamic groups and terrorist networks Israel for example might experience temporary lulls in violence after it targets and kills suspected Hamas leaders Damage to an organization though does not necessarily hurt its cause and Palestinian rage has only been fueledThe February killing of former acting Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev by two Russian security agents in Doha brought no letup in violence in the Caucasus the paper notes Since then the Kremlinbacked Chechen president Akhmedhadji Kadyrov was assassinated and a raid by hundreds of suspected Ingush and Chechen fighters in Ingushetia left dozens dead The two Russian agents involved in Yandarbievs killing were sentenced yesterday to 25year prison sentences by a Qatari court Yandarbievs death might have had a shortterm effect on the financing of the rebels but it definitely dealt no mortal blow to their command and control the paper saysAnd just like the assassinations of the Hamas leaders the killing of Yandarbiev might in the end generate more support for the separatists cause in Chechnya as Yandarbievs followers seek to portray him as a martyrUnder these circumstances the Moscow daily says the idea of assassinating a leader in an attempt to bring down an entire movement is a dangerous myth where the biggest collateral damage is to the longterm chances for peaceINTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNEDavid Malone and Kirsti Samuels of the International Peace Academy say it is well known that nation building is a long and complex process but the dynamics of international relations encourage rushed interventions A short international attention span a growing list of crisis states and the pursuit of exit strategies that suggest an early and happy ending all serve to render many international interventions hasty and often incomplete If we are serious about statebuilding it is time to face up to the reality Building institutions that are robust enough to deal with the vicissitudes of human nature and political activity is not a quick process It is futile to take on ambitious statebuilding projects and then succumb to international and domestic shorttermismThe authors say this approach is not only morally deplorable it is also unjustifiable on pragmatic grounds since the resources effort and time invested are all to naught when crisis reignitesMalone and Samuels suggest separating a nations nascent political process from the transfer of control over institutions A staggered process of institutional handover like that effected in Kosovo might be a better approach A real commitment to nation building requires a cleareyed prioritization of crises and the realization that the world should respond to a few crises better rather than to try to respond to more and failTHE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITORA contribution to the daily by Daniel Twining a former US Senate foreign policy adviser and now of the German Marshall Fund discusses Europes frozen conflicts and Russian influence on the borders of EuropeMoldova for example is a country where the Cold War never ended Russia maintains troops in Moldova to support Transdniesters bid for secession and the Moldovan president effectively answers to leaders in Moscow Meanwhile the region is home to international criminal networks trafficking in humans weapons and drugs Political reform in Moldova has been frozen by the Transdniestria crisis Twining says And the Kremlins Transdniestria strategy is similar to its approach to other frozen conflicts that are also sustained by Russian military forces and political support including the provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and the enclave of NagornoKarabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan Twining says Moscows ambition is to ensure Russian troops guard European borders and serve as outposts of imperial control in independent nations In the absence of treaties legitimizing Russias illegal military presence on its neighbors territory Russia will keep these conflicts frozen  ensuring that secessionist leaders who answer to Moscow remain in control Twining advocates a united transAtlantic campaign to resolve the frozen conflicts and democratize Europes borderlands He also suggests putting these outstanding disputes on the agenda of the NATORussia Council Together he says the United States and Europe should condition deeper Russian access to Western markets on Moscows willingness to negotiate democratic political solutions to Europes frozen conflicts
https://www.rferl.org/a/1053548.html,Analysis Mediators Seek New Formula For Karabakh ,"June 26, 2004 12:30 GMT",Three days later Russian cochairman Yurii Merzlyakov announced in Moscow that the discussions focused on a new peace proposal that would bridge the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two sides,Three days later Russian cochairman Yurii Merzlyakov announced in Moscow that the discussions focused on a new peace proposal that would bridge the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two sidesSince 1998 Armenia has insisted on a package solution to the conflict that would address and resolve all disputed issues in a single agreement without leaving any loose ends even if the various provisions of that agreement were implemented not simultaneously but consecutively over timeAzerbaijan by contrast favors a stepbystep approach under which a series of separate aspects of the problem would be addressed and resolved one at a time and the second problem or set of problems would be addressed only after measures to implement the first had been successfully completed That approach would theoretically enable Azerbaijan to demand a major concession from Armenia  such as the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the regions that they currently control bordering on the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic  without making a concession of similar magnitude in returnThat approach is anathema to Yerevan insofar as it entails the possible danger of Armenia surrendering its biggest bargaining chip  the occupied districts  without securing in return what it considers most important namely a castiron agreement that NagornoKarabakh should not be vertically subordinated to the Azerbaijani central governmentUS diplomats previously involved in the Minsk Group process say that the package approach was the basis for the tentative agreements known as the Paris principles arrived at during the spring of 2001 during talks in Paris and Florida between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Heidar Aliyev Aliyev however apparently subsequently realized that it would be more difficult than he originally thought to persuade the Azerbaijani people to accept a peace agreement that required a major concession from Baku Precisely what status NagornoKarabakh was to have been granted under the Paris principles remains a matter for conjecture Aliyev rejected a proposal by the Minsk Group in late 1998 that Azerbaijan and NagornoKarabakh should form a common stateThe failure of the Paris Principles underscores the degree to which the outcome of any peace process is inevitably hostage to domestic political considerations specifically the willingness or the reluctance of national leaders to risk their careers by agreeing to concessions that many voters consider not only politically unacceptable but an insult to the memory of those who gave their lives fighting While success could be rewarded by a nomination for the Nobel Peace prize failure or even badly judged timing can spell the end of a political careerOne of the reasons for Armenian President Levon TerPetrossians forced resignation in February 1998 was his readiness to accept a stepbystep peace plan unveiled by the Minsk Group the previous September Azerbaijans current president Ilham Aliyev who hopes to win a second presidential term in 2008 has little incentive to undermine his chances of doing so by making major concessions before then and indeed has said on several occasions that he will never do soThe conflict sides and the OSCE Minsk Group have a gentlemens agreement not to divulge either specific proposals under discussion or the reactions of one side to statements by the other That insistence on the confidentiality of the negotiating process is intended to preclude the leak of details that could destroy a tenuous consensus reached in months or even years of talks by provoking a domestic political backlash that might even endanger the stability of one or both governments But the lack of detailed information also serves to engender any amount of speculation disinformation and rumors concerning peace proposals that have no formal status  such as that by EU rapporteur Per Gahrton early this year that Armenia withdraw its forces from five occupied Azerbaijani districts in return for the resumption of rail communication between Azerbaijan and ArmeniaMerzlyakovs Moscow disclosure suggests that there are indeed grounds for cautious optimism that a solution to the conflict could be reached But Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov warned that it will take time The Azerbaijani daily Ekho on 24 June quoted him as comparing the negotiations to cooking implying that for the best results neither process should be rushed At the same time Mammadyarov expressed confidence that the final product will be both tasty and digestible to everyone

TRIBUNEWhile the worlds attention is now focused on the impending 30 June transfer of authority to Iraq its interest is flagging in another country where a democratic opportunity is already at hand waiting to be seizedAfghan citizens after a quartercentury during which they suffered civil war Soviet occupation Taliban rule and the arrival of AlQaeda are scheduled to go to the polls in September for presidential and parliamentary elections But in the runup to these crucial ballots they are getting less international help than they were promised and far less than they deserve Afghan Transitional Administration Chairman Hamid Karzai is expected to win the presidential poll easily the paper says But a more important question is whether security will be adequate to allow most Afghans to register and vote without risking their livesThe help Karzai has received so far has been insufficient NATO has deployed only 6400 troops to Afghanistan and most of these remain in and around Kabul leaving the Karzai government with little control beyond the capital Pledges to donate more troops and funds have failed to translate into concrete aidIts not terribly surprising that NATO would be reluctant to send forces to help in Iraq since the American invasion was so unpopular in Europe the Chicago daily says But it is harder to imagine why Europeans would be so miserly when it comes to AfghanistanNATO allies are now at risk of not finishing the job they began in Afghanistan The elections planned for September are a major test of NATOs seriousness about multilateral efforts to fight terrorism and spread democracy the paper says So far its failingFRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNGThe loud chorus of praise for the EU constitutional treaty is only partly being sung for what the document actually says says columnist Gunther Nonnenmacher The rest is an expression of relief that a process begun in December 2001 with the appointment of a convention has actually come to a successful conclusionMuch of the squabbling over the document was due to a disagreement over decisionmaking and representation The new EU text now states that a majority vote of 55 percent of the member countries in the Council of Ministers must represent 65 percent of the EU population The paper calls this a logical apportionment because the decisionmaking process now recognizes that Europe is not only an organization of governments but also of people But European leaders must now go before their constituents to try to sell an unwieldy document that contains about 80 pages devoted to institutional regulations about 30 devoted to basic rights and about 50 devoted to an appendix with protocols And all these pages are filled with a language that is laborious and at times simply incomprehensibleSo it still remains to be seen whether the constitutional treaty will become historic And given the low turnout and voter skepticism seen in the 13 June elections to the European Parliament Nonnenmacher says national referendums on the constitution could lead to the rejection of the treaty  and possibly to the failure of the draftLE FIGAROAlexandrine Bouilhet discusses a letter sent on 21 June from the Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi to NATO SecretaryGeneral Jaap de Hoop Scheffer requesting NATO aid in stabilizing his country after the scheduled 30 June transfer of power Bouilhet says while Allawis request emanated from Baghdad it was largely inspired by the United States The appeal which Bouilhet says was made public by Washington comes ahead of a scheduled NATO summit and is sure to be a hot topic of conversation when the allies meet in Istanbul on 2829 JuneWithout going so far as to request the deployment of NATO troops to Iraq which Bouilhet says would be as absurd as it is unrealistic Allawi has proposed that NATO take charge of local security forces such as the army the police force or customs officials De Hoop Scheffer has said he trusts the allies will respond favorably to Allawis letter in Istanbul Italy and the East European countries hastened to lend their support to the secretarygeneral But all eyes then turn to France and Germany the troublemakers of NATO who hold veto power in Brussels Whereas Washington has insisted for months that it wishes to share the Iraqi burden with its allies Paris and Berlin have always refused to take decisive action not wishing to give the impression that they sanction the USled occupationBut the USIraqi request will be hard to refuse Bouilhet says Sixteen of 26 NATO members are already involved in Iraq through training or other projects After all she says US President George W Bush is not the only one who wants to involve NATO in Iraqs rebuildingEURASIA VIEWA contribution by Cory Welt a Russian and Eurasian affairs analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies discusses recent indications of a willingness to reform coming out of Yerevan On a recent trip to Washington Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian outlined a bold vision for political reform regional security and cooperation with neighbors Azerbaijan and Turkey His statements provided a welcome change to the disheartening news that has been coming out of Armenia in recent monthsWelt says the Armenian governments brutal crackdown against opposition protests this April its attacks on journalists the ransacking of opposition headquarters and political arrests were a blatant contradiction of democratic standards But Oskanians remarks appeared to be more than mere PR public relations pitches as the minister also laid out means for allowing Armenias opposition to reconcile its differences with the government While chiding Armenias political opposition for its aggressive attitude towards the authorities Oskanian revealed a standing government offer to give opposition deputies veto rights on three issues amendments to the election code constitutional reform and anticorruption legislationBut whether the leadership in Yerevan will truly seize the opportunity to implement this plan for political dialogue remains in doubt howeverThe opposition failed to galvanize much support for protests last spring and returning to parliament with concessions akin to the ones Oskanian described would be a facesaving maneuver as its popularity has since fallenWelt says While the oppositions failure to mount a serious challenge might give Armenian authorities confidence to further inhibit official respect for rule of law the governments newfound security could also encourage it to move in a positive direction THE ECONOMISTAn item in this Londonbased weekly magazine says the accession to power of Iraqs new prime minister Iyad Allawi has given rise to the hope that a swelling majority of Iraqis seeing control of their country reverting to their compatriots will rally to the new order help it undermine the insurgency and so gradually let Iraq reach a state of minimal normality in which a patchy peace a measure of prosperity and a modicum of political civility if not fullfledged democracy can prevailLittle may change on the ground with the return of Iraqi sovereignty on 30 June the magazine says Soldiers and civilians are likely to continue dying and Iraq will remain a conquered land with Iraqis accusing the infidel of still defiling the nation and its holy places by the mere fact of his presenceBut some significant things will change says the magazine Allawi has made clear that Iraq reserves the right to ask the USled forces to leave and Washington has indicated they will if asked to do so The changes are not just semantic says The Economist Unlike the USled Coalition Provisional Authority the incoming regime is an Iraqi one with executive powers endorsed unanimously in the UNs Security Council approved by virtually all the countries of the Middle East and in the Muslim world More importantly so far it seems that most Iraqis however warily are willing to give it a fair chance What they want above anything else  way above democracy it must be admitted  is peace If Mr Allawi can use an iron fist to achieve that they are very likely to back himTHE WASHINGTON POSTThe papers David Ignatius says the hope for interim Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi is that he can use parts of the old power structure to restore security to a country that over the past year of occupation has been coming apart at the seamsIgnatius who is acquainted with the Iraq politician says Allawi has the advantage of a stolid imperturbability Trained as a medical doctor he seems unfazed by a life of repeated assassination attempts including one in 1978 that nearly killed him Hes an amiable somewhat disheveled man who has to be prodded to buy the fancy clothes befitting a politician Since his nomination as prime minister Allawi has made a surprisingly fast start issuing almost daily proposals and public statements Inevitably he has tried to distance himself from his US patronsAllawis appeal and also his liability is that he will govern Iraq as a strongman His biggest problem these next few months will be staying alive in the face of death threats His only real protection will be the support of other Iraqis In that sense for all the US troops who will remain after Wednesdays 30 June handover Iraqs fate will really be in the hands of Iraqis once again

confidence EU officials are singling out Georgia as deserving star treatment among the South Caucasus countries,Brussels 15 June 2004 RFERL  With increasing confidence EU officials are singling out Georgia as deserving star treatment among the South Caucasus countriesIt was Georgias Rose Revolution that forced the EU to reverse its decision to exclude the region from its neighborhood policy The decision to include the South Caucasus was formally confirmed on 14 June by EU foreign ministers What is seen as President Mikheil Saakashvilis genuine desire for reform has propelled Georgia far ahead of its two neighbors in terms of EU attentionThe EUs special representative for the South Caucasus Finnish diplomat Heikki Talvitie spoke in Brussels today praising Georgias pioneering role Basically when I started last July we had on the agenda the question How to develop these relations with the South Caucasus And then suddenly the Rose Revolution happened in Georgia and this accelerated things a lot Georgia became a focus for international politics Georgia got the priority on the agenda of many countries  including the United States Russia Turkey the European Union among others and our member states This meant that there was a sort of a push to our relations with the South Caucasus Talvitie saidWhat is seen as President Mikheil Saakashvilis genuine desire for reform has propelled Georgia far ahead of its two neighbors in terms of EU attention EU foreign ministers on 14 June decided to launch a rule of law mission in Georgia to help the country improve its criminaljustice system Not only will it be the first EU mission of its kind it also marks the first application of the blocs defense and security policy outside of the Balkans or Africa Tomorrow a World Banksponsored donors conference for Georgia will take place in Brussels The United States and Russia sit side by side with EU member states and the European Commission Officials say the pledges are expected to total almost 500 million euros 607 million from 2004 to 2006 Speaking privately EU officials say the bloc has no choice but to focus on Georgia Saakashvilis anticorruption drive is seen as particularly impressive The recent peaceful defusing of the standoff with Adjaran strongman Aslan Abashidze is another credit to Saakashvilis name EU sources note that Talvitie together with the US ambassador to Georgia and former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov played an important mediating role The EU however remains concerned over the possibility of conflict in another troubled Georgian region South Ossetia Another challenge Saakashvili is said to face is that of allowing a credible opposition to appear Armenia and Azerbaijan meanwhile are in the back seat Their main problem is the NagornoKarabakh conflict One EU official told RFERL that although the EU wants to help both countries we cannot do much with two armies facing each otherTalvitie today said democratic reforms in both countries have also been slow Azerbaijan and Armenia naturally had been in focus earlier with their elections he said And that has been a little bit negative development because we had expected quite a lot especially in Armenia concerning the elections as regards the democratic process fair and free elections It was a little bit of a disappointment that the Armenians could not fulfill the expectations In Azerbaijan the situation was the same but basically we are now over this period and we are working with both Azerbaijan and Armenia on their constitutions and how to develop further respect for human rights the rule of law and democratic processEU officials stress that both Azerbaijan and Armenia must take steps for the more than 10yearold mediation effort to get off the ground Sources make clear however that the bloc seeks no formal mediating role in the foreseeable futureInstead said Talvitie today the EU stands by with offers of substantial aid If theres a need for some rehabilitation program in order to start the peace process the EU could be ready to tackle these programs to really make positive initiatives in order to facilitate even in a detailed way a solution try to find a solution he saidThe EU is also conducting discreet talks with Turkey and Russia on the issue Meanwhile Talvitie said today the EU is preparing concrete aid measures to help relieve tensions between Georgia and its breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia In South Ossetia a new railway link with Georgia is planned as well as support for refugees As for Abkhazia plans for a construction program are under way to span a valley cutting the region off from the Georgian mainlandOverall EU officials say Armenia is in the least favorable situation of the three countries having to rely heavily on its diaspora in Russia and elsewhere in the absence of significant natural resources Azerbaijan on the other hand has massive oil reserves which will also benefit Georgia by means of a new pipeline to the Black Sea which will be put into operation next year EU officials have in recent weeks praised the constructive role Russia has begun to play in the region One senior diplomat mentioned the Adjaran crisis as well as ongoing talks with Georgia on joint border management The diplomat said Russia has clearly become interested in stability on its southern borders The diplomat said good links exist between EU and US diplomats in the region He said the US stance became significantly more cooperative during the spring adding that this has allowed a detailed coordination of efforts to take place

April quoted Kocharian as saying he believes his talks with Aliyev in Warsaw can really contribute to finding common ground for the basis of negotiations at future meetings RFERLs Armenian Service reported Oskanian added that there will be clear instructions from the presidents to the foreign ministers regarding putting the negotiations on a certain basis So we see positive movement and believe there will be a continuation That formulation suggests that the Warsaw talks clarified the Azerbaijani negotiating position In an interview published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung following his 16 April talks with Mammadyarov in Prague Oskanian said that meeting failed to shed any light on how seriously a statement made by Mammedyarovs predecessor Vilayat Guliev in February should be taken Guliev had advocated beginning talks again from zero see RFERL Newsline 13 February 2004 Oskanian told the German daily he believes Gulievs statement was intended purely for internal Azerbaijani consumption Neither Oskanian nor Kocharian has given any indication of what issues were discussed during their respective talks with their Azerbaijani counterparts But Mammadyarov told AFP on 30 April that the two sides are discussing the withdrawal of Armenian forces from seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic in exchange for the restoration of rail communication between the two countries The subject of our negotiations right now is how ready the sides are to make compromises AFP quoted Mammadyarov as sayingIlham Aliyev said on 7 May that the proposal that Armenian forces withdraw from the seven districts in return for the resumption of rail communication originated in Baku and was not suggested by the US Russian and French cochairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group which has been attempting to mediate a solution of the conflict for the past 12 years The EU initially included in a resolution on the South Caucasus adopted earlier this year a demand for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Agdam Djabrail Fizuli Gubadly and Zangelan districts of Azerbaijan in return for the restoration of rail communication between Azerbaijan and Armenia but Oskanian at the time rejected that approach and the demand was dropped before the final version of the resolution was passed see RFERL Newsline 30 January 3 and 27 February and 1 March 2004 It is not clear why having rejected earlier this year the initial EU proposal to withdraw from five districts the Armenian side should now be prepared to discuss withdrawing from seven districts as the Azerbaijani officials claimMeanwhile Vladimir Kazimirov who served in mid1990s as the Russian cochairman of the OSCE Minsk Group has again slammed Armenias stated preference for a package solution to the conflict that would simultaneously resolve all contentious issues In an interview published on 30 April in Nezavisimaya gazeta Kazimirov said a package solution to such a complex conflict is impossible and that continued insistence on it will only freeze the situation and lead the mediation into a blind alley Instead Kazimirov argued it would be more advisable to begin the search for a solution with comparatively minor pointsIn a second article published in Vremya novostei on 7 May Kazimirov argued that it is important to reestablish a mechanism for constant contacts between the two sides He pointed out that the presidents of the two countries cannot meet that often and one should not place the entire responsibility for concessions on them personally Similarly Kazimirov continued the foreign ministers also have numerous other responsibilities Therefore he concluded it would be better for each side to choose a delegation that would concentrate exclusively on the Karabakh conflict In addition he argued that the leadership of the unrecognized NagornoKarabakh Republic should be included in talks on general issues related to a solution of the conflict Azerbaijan however has consistently rejected any Karabakh representation at peace talks Kazimirov suggested that the renewed peace talks should focus simultaneously on four issues on the principle of territory for security Those four issues are strengthening the existing ceasefire and precluding a resumption of hostilities removing the root of the conflict by addressing the future status of Karabakh removing the consequences of the conflict by withdrawing Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani districts demining operations and the return of displaced persons to their homes and what he terms elementary measures to reduce tension and normalize relations Kazimirov acknowledged however that progress on the second and third issues would be slow

PACE voted this week to recommend that the councils Committee of Ministers considers suspending all contacts with the Belarusian leadership until an independent investigation is conducted into the disappearances of journalists and political opponentsIn a separate resolution PACE warned that failure to comply would lead to maintaining sanctions against Belarus or barring the countrys parliamentarians from attending the assemblys sessions even informally The warning came just two weeks after the UNs Human Rights Commission censured Belarus over the disappearances and other rights abuses Belarus had its special guest status in the Council of Europe suspended in 1997 amid claims that its constitution was falling short of democratic standards and handing too much power to President Alyaksandr Lukashenka Since then Belarus has been regularly criticized in Strasbourg for its poor human rights record including harassment of nongovernmental media restrictions of religious freedom and reports of random arrestsAs a criminal lawyer I have no doubt that these disappearances were ordered at the highest possible level in the establishment of BelarusThis weeks PACE recommendation and resolution refer to the disappearance and feared extrajudiciary execution of former Interior Minister Yury Zakharanka former parliament speaker Viktar Hanchar businessman Anatol Krasouski and Dmitri Zavadsky a cameraman for the Russian private television channel NTVAll four disappearances which occurred in 1999 and 2000 are believed to be politically motivated Although Belarusian authorities deny any wrongdoing they have persistently ignored calls to conduct independent investigations into the casesGreek Cypriot delegate Christos Pourgourides who authored a report on Belarus that was debated at the assembly before the 28 April vote said the people responsible for these disappearances should be searched for among the countrys top leadershipAs a criminal lawyer I have no doubt that these disappearances were ordered at the highest possible level in the establishment of Belarus I cannot be certain that the order was given by President Lukashenka himself but I am absolutely certain that the order for their abduction was given by people very very close to the president Pourgourides saidIn another resolution adopted this week the Strasbourgbased assembly severely criticized Belarus for the systematic harassment and intimidations carried out by state officialsagainst journalists editors and media outlets which are critical of the president or the governmentRussia which is linked to Belarus by a union treaty expressed its disagreement over the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the assemblyTalking to journalists after the vote Konstantin Kosachev the chairman of the State Dumas Foreign Affairs Committee criticized the documents for being too emotional Russia itself has been criticized in the past in Strasbourg for human

Affairs Committee He said he will prepare a report to be debated at the assemblys next plenary session later that monthSince I was appointed rapporteur last July I have never been allowed to visit Chechnya and there is no use to make a report based only on journalists accounts You have to go on a factfinding mission yourself But now after one year I have the impression that the Russian

Swiss delegate to meet Chechen separatist President Aslan Maskhadov  as he says he intends to  remains unclear howeverThe situation in Armenia where President Robert Kocharian and his coalition cabinet are engaged in a bitter standoff with opponents was also debated this week in StrasbourgArmenias parliamentary opposition accuses Kocharian of rigging last years presidential and legislative polls and insists his leadership should to be put to a vote of national confidence The Armenian capital Yerevan has witnessed daily opposition rallies for nearly three weeks now Tensions bubbled over on 13 April when police rounded up dozens of opposition activists and raided opposition party officesThe crackdown was strongly criticized by Council of Europe SecretaryGeneral Walter Schwimmer who regretted the absence of democratic debate in Armenia In a resolution adopted this week PACE urged the Armenian leadership to refrain from any actions that could be seen as attempts at curtailing freedom of expression and movement It also called for an investigation into the recent incidents While reiterating its profound disappointment at last years flawed elections the assembly also urged Kocharians opponents to strive to achieve their goals within the constitutional framework and called upon both sides to enter into a dialogue without preconditionsArmenia was admitted into the Council of Europe in January 2001 along with its neighbor AzerbaijanAlthough neither country met democracy standards the Strasbourgbased body hoped that opening its ranks simultaneously to the rival nations would help them reach a solution to their territorial dispute over NagornoKarabakhDespite a 1994 ceasefire Yerevan and Baku remain technically at war over the predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave For various reasons both sides have rejected successive settlement blueprints drafted by the Minsk Group the 13member group of nations mandated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate in the talks Addressing the PACE assembly yesterday Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev reiterated his countrys traditional stance which consists of demanding that ethnic Armenian troops withdraw from all Azerbaijani lands they have been occupying since 1993 prior to any discussion on the status of NagornoKarabakh Aliyev succeeded his then ailing father last October following a controversial presidential election marred by irregularities street violence and the subsequent arrest of opposition activists During his threeyear tenure as his countrys chief PACE delegate Aliyev often had to adopt a defensive position amid criticism of Bakus poor human rights record Yesterday however his first address to the assembly as Azerbaijani president was delivered in a much more cordial atmosphereAliyev hinted that he might release all inmates that the Council of Europe insists are political prisoners However when asked whether he thought he could do so before PACEs September session the Azerbaijani leader remained noncommittalWhen I was elected in my first speech after my inauguration I said I would be the president of all Azerbaijanis  and that is what I am doing The policy of putting an end to the dramatic history of the past will continue but it is very difficult to do that alone All political forces must take an active part in doing that The steps that I have taken in pardoning prisoners show that intention and that policy and I think that that policy will continue Aliyev said Last month Aliyev signed a decree amnestying nearly 130 prisoners including Suret Huseynov a former prime minister who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999 on charges of plotting against the state Huseynovs release brought down to five the number of political prisoners that the Council of Europe wants Azerbaijan to release in the coming monthsIn the meantime an estimated 100 opposition activists detained last October have been charged over their alleged participation in postelection violence Some of them have already been convicted while others are still awaiting trialAliyev yesterday justified the crackdown on the opposition describing it as protection against the hostility that he says continues to exist in Azerbaijani society

as the stillfragile Georgian and the wellentrenched Armenian governments each face escalating internal challenges There are key differences however between the Georgian and Armenian situations that suggest very different trajectories for the two countries,Washington 14 April 2004 RFERL  The South Caucasus once again faces the threat of instability as the stillfragile Georgian and the wellentrenched Armenian governments each face escalating internal challenges There are key differences however between the Georgian and Armenian situations that suggest very different trajectories for the two countriesFirst there is a fundamental difference in the nature of the threat faced by each state The immediate challenge to the Georgian government posed by its ongoing confrontation with the assertive leadership of the autonomous region of Adjaria is only one aspect of a much greater challenge that constitutes a serious test of legitimacy and authority for the struggling Georgian state That threat is further magnified by the loss of territorial control over the breakaway unrecognized republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and by the steady erosion of authority from the central government to the regions Resolving the confrontation with Adjaria is therefore just one step toward the larger task of reversing this devolution of power and strengthening Georgian sovereignty by restoring centralgovernment control over the entire countryIn neighboring Armenia by contrast the political opposition is seeking to dislodge a powerful government apparatus Unlike the threat to the Georgian state the Armenian crisis is more a competition between elites and less a threat to state authority although the reaction of the Armenian leadership undoubtedly creates doubt about the durability of its legitimacyThe second key difference between the two crises lies in the nature of the two regimes Despite a superficial similarity the political situation in Armenia today is significantly different from that in Georgia in late 2003 when President Eduard Shevardnadze was forced from power in a peaceful Rose Revolution The Georgian transition was unique and holds no real lessons for Armenia Regime change in Georgia was the result of a complicated combination of factors very few of which are present in Armenia Most importantly the outcome in Georgia was due as much to the weakness of the state as to the strength of civil society It was in other words a combination of a power vacuum and a weakened state that presented the opportunity for the peaceful advent to power of a group of young proWestern politicians headed by former Justice Minister Mikheil SaakashviliIn Armenia however the reverse is true A strong and assertive state is exercising without restraint its powers of control and intimidation against a traditionally marginalized opposition The Armenian regime also differs from its Georgian counterpart in its reaction to the confrontation By resorting swiftly to force and coercion the Armenian leadership has contributed to a cycle of violence and an arrogance of power that can only bolster the opposition in the long run But even with the potential of Armenian civil society there is no easy or open avenue to confront the government despite the illusion of the oppositions demands for impeachment and sporadic demonstrations in the streets The fate of democracy in Armenia is in fact very much in danger and the real challenge to Armenian national security comes from within not from any external threatYet the political situation in Armenia today is more complex than a simple confrontation between the Armenian government and the political opposition There are a number of internal fault lines running through Armenian society that could determine the course of the oppositiongovernment political standoffPolitics in Armenia is increasingly expressed in a contest between entrenched elites on the one hand and a ruling elite happy to rule but hesitant to govern and an opposition whose appeal lies in the personalities of its leaders rather than its platform on the other This competition of elites is marked by a struggle for control over the countrys limited resource base and economic assets a struggle in which the political opposition is also a wellestablished player The largest and most significant group excluded from this competition for wealth is the majority of the Armenian population which remains impoverished and disenfranchised from the real political processIt is this divide between the ruling and aspiring political elite and a frustrated although largely apathetic and weary Armenian population that serves as the one potential advantage for the opposition By tapping widespread general frustration and mistrust of the incumbent leadership the opposition hopes to galvanize their campaign against President Robert Kocharian as an avenue to power There is no guarantee however that once in power the opposition would be any better or any more honest than the government it superseded More unites the authorities and the opposition than divides them and the real struggle in Armenia is for power not democracy or social justiceThe fate of democracy in Armenia is in fact very much in danger and the real challenge to Armenian national security comes from within not from any external threat And as in the case of much of the Caucasus the Armenian people remain hostage to the petty politics and shortsighted governance of their socalled leaders In many ways both the state and the opposition are seeking to rule out of selfinterest instead of seeking to govern in the national interest Moreover the Armenian leadership through its use of harsh repression mass detentions and the arrogant demonstration of its disdain for democracy is actually only legitimizing the politics of the opposition while undercutting its own waning legitimacy and authorityBut the most important point is that the true test of the stability and legitimacy of the Armenian government rests in its handling of the current crisis The Armenian government might well be the author of its own demise by overestimating and overreacting to the perceived threat posed by the opposition

easy to understand why the love affair with Europe is on the wane the paper says For a dozen years joining the Union was held out to Eastern Europeans as the ultimate reward for reforming their ways It turns out that the reward will be doled out in installments Farmers in the new member countries will receive a fraction of the agricultural subsidies now given to EU members Citizens of accession nations will also not yet be allowed to work anywhere in the EU due to a sevenyear moratorium on the easttowest movement of labor Central European nations still lack the strong democratic institutions that can keep authoritarianminded politicians in check The New York Times warns that the rise of Euroskeptic protest politicians in Central Europe can do lasting damage in nations still finding their way THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPEInspired by Georgias Rose Revolution Armenians are also demanding regime change writes David Phillips of the Council on Foreign Relations in The Wall Street Journal Europe Thousands of peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators have gathered in Yerevans Freedom Square in recent days The government arrested hundreds and is threatening violence if protesters march on the presidential palaceThe corrupt and inept administration of President Robert Kocharian has turned Armenians apathy to anger he says People especially the youth are frustrated by the lack of opportunities To avoid a bloody conflict an internationally supervised referendum should be held to determine whether a majority want to recall Kocharian Phillips says the United States should help Armenia manage the next phase of its troubled transition to democracy which would be consistent with its support for reform in Eastern Europe and emerging postSoviet states He writes While making clear that it will not tolerate violence against prodemocracy demonstrators in Freedom Square Washington can help broker a solution to Armenias political impasse by encouraging an agreement between the government and opposition to hold a referendum within three monthsTHE BOSTON GLOBEWriting in The Boston Globe columnist HDS Greenway says the parallels between the USled occupation of Iraq and Israels presence in the West Bank and Gaza grow more striking every day Both the Israeli and American administrations like to say that it isnt occupation thats the problem It is simply terrorism they say But while terrorism is a factor the central issue in the territories that Israel occupies is the Israeli occupation and always has been he says The vast majority of Arabs see little difference between the two struggles Whether it be Americans or Israelis supported by Americans it is Arabs who are living and dying under the occupationsBut the two occupations are also different in key ways Greenway says The Americans in Iraq are trying to get out as quickly as they can and turn the country over to its inhabitants In contrast the current Israeli government hopes to keep as much of the occupied territories as it can And whereas the USled coalition is seeking an Iraqiled government administration it can negotiate with the government of Ariel Sharon has done everything in its power to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the symbols of Palestinian nationalism  and then he says he has no negotiating partner Greenway says it is curious given Israels failure to bring peace and stability to the West Bank and Gaza that the US military would seek to emulate Israeli tactics And yet Israelis are now training US forces in counterinsurgency strategy Meanwhile the Iraqi rebellion grows more widespread by the day THE WASHINGTON POSTThe Washington Posts Dan Balz says US President George W Bush was unapologetic as he answered questions at a rare news conference last night Bush steadfastly refused to admit mistakes and passed up opportunities to explain what it will take to achieve his goal of a free and stable IraqIt was soon clear that the presidents aim was not to provide new details consider a shift in policy or acknowledge any rethinking of his decisions in the face of recent setbacks Instead it was to restate his determination to stay the course and to argue anew that the war in Iraq will make America more secure But Bush repeatedly sidestepped pointed questions about his policies and was better at describing his vision of a democratic Iraq than in explaining how he will overcome the mounting obstacles to achieve that visionThe US president came under pressure to show that he has a plan for success On that score his performance left more questions than answers Several times he seemed to defer policy decisions to other officials Asked about whether the United States would have to commit more troops in Iraq Bush said it would be up to the generals on the ground When asked to what authority the US coalition would transfer power on 30 June Bush said it would be up to UN special representative Lakhdar Brahimi to put together a ruling coalition that is acceptable to all Iraqis And when questioned about how long US forces might have to stay in the country he replied in mere platitudes As long as necessary and not one day more

monitors democracy around the world today published a list of countries that it claims need help to achieve democracy  or to further improve it,Prague 7 April 2004 RFERL  Freedom House an organization that monitors democracy around the world today published a list of countries that it claims need help to achieve democracy  or to further improve itThe New Yorkbased group says its list of 30 countries is the first of its kind It is aimed not just at criticizing the countries named but also at drawing the international communitys attention to the fact that they need assistanceIn presenting the report  called Countries at the Crossroads  Freedom Houses Executive Director Jennifer Windsor said these countries are at key transition points and to ignore their needs creates a risk of both individual backsliding and regional democratic deteriorationThe list includes Afghanistan and Pakistan the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in the Caucasus Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia and in Europe Ukraine Several Arab states are also mentioned such as Bahrain Qatar and Yemen In Afghanistan the report finds that the rule of the gun largely supersedes the rule of law It says that extra military support is urgently needed to stabilize the country outside the capital Kabul and that the rights of Afghan women remain at Talibanera levels in some regions In Pakistan it says the growing role of the military in government and civil life is a major obstacle to democratic reform and that promises of reform have not so far shown results In Kazakhstan the report finds an authoritarian system with limited scope for political competition Kyrgyzstan it says has experienced initial democratic openings that have since stalled or eroded The report sees Uzbekistan as being among the most politically repressive states in the world having perpetrated what it calls gross violations of human rights and religious freedomsTurning to the Caucasus the Freedom House report finds that In Armenia the limited democratic reforms that were undertaken have gradually eroded and stalled and are in danger of complete reversal In Georgia before Novembers ouster of President Eduard Shevardnadze the situation was rated the same as in Armenia  In Azerbaijan there is an authoritarian system with limited scope for political competition  In Ukraine the limited democratic reforms that were undertaken have gradually eroded and stalled and are in danger of complete reversal I think the key question is what happens to US policy  for how long the US is going to go on supporting authoritarian regimes in Central Asia while trying to spread democracy in the Middle East  Political analyst Heather Grabbe of the Centre for European ReformFreedom Houses inclusion today of Uzbekistan as one of the most repressive regimes comes after the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD announced yesterday that it was banning most loans to Uzbekistan because of continued political repression and lack of economic reformEBRD President Jean Lemierre said the bank will stay engaged to push for reforms but can no longer conduct business as usual in UzbekistanEBRD spokesman Jeff Hiday  speaking in London before yesterdays decision  gave the methodology on which the bank based its decision It set criteria against which Uzbekistans performance could be measuredThe environment in Uzbekistan has been particularly challenging So we set seven benchmarks And we sought for Uzbekistan to demonstrate progress on these benchmarks The extent to which they made progress would determine the extent to which we continue to invest in the country Hiday saidThe watchdog organization Human Rights Watch today praised the EBRDs decision calling it unprecedented and principled and describing Uzbekistans rights record as appallingHuman Rights Watch spokeswoman Vanessa Saenan said in Brussels that the EBRD should apply its benchmark system to other countries as wellThere are several other countries out there particularly in Central Asia and the Caucasus where a similar approach to that taken with respect to Uzbekistan would be warranted Saenan saidAnother Human Rights Watch spokeswoman Veronika Leila in Geneva listed those countries saying such benchmarking could become a standard method for measuring progress in democratic and economic reformsIt would be Turkmenistan Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Tajikistan In the South Caucasus we are talking about Georgia Azerbaijan and Armenia In Europe it would not be unwarranted to take a similar approach with respect to Ukraine So we are really hoping that the EBRD after this experience with Uzbekistan will become more forceful and serious about its political mandate as it has really demonstrated that it is able to operationalize if you wish its political mandate which makes clear that it was set up to engage those countries in the region which do respect democracy and human rights Leila saidLeila called on the United States and the European Union to take a harder line with countries like Uzbekistan which are allies but which do not observe human rights She noted that the US government must soon issue its periodic certifications for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan confirming that they are making progress on rights commitments so that aid can be continuedShe said these two countries are plainly not making progressPolitical analyst Heather Grabbe of the Centre for European Reform in London said that much will depend on what the United States doesI think the key question is what happens to US policy  for how long the US is going to go on supporting authoritarian regimes in Central Asia while trying to spread democracy in the Middle East It doesnt really make sense and obviously the US agenda has a huge impact on the role of the international organizations Grabbe saidGrabbe said its an important moment for international donors to consider the conditions they attach to their financing But she also said there was a persistent lack of consensus within the international community on how to deal with repressive regimes The complete Freedom House survey can be found

the planned rally was set to mark the beginning of a massive nationwide antigovernment campaignJustice which has been regularly boycotting parliamentary sessions in recent months accuses the Armenian leader of usurping power and clamping down on freedom of expression At the core of the dispute are last years presidential and legislative polls which saw the victory of Kocharian and his allies Justice and other opposition groups claim the vote was rigged and insist that the president be put to a national vote of confidence The government has denied any wrongdoing in the elections Anxious to avoid a political crisis over the disputed elections Armenias Constitutional Court last year signaled the constitution could in principle be amended in a way that would allow for a national referendum on confidence But government supporters in the National Assembly parliament rejected the idea saying it had no legal basis One of the three partners in the ruling coalition the Dashnaktsutyun Armenian Revolutionary Federation yesterday demanded that the opposition cease to question Kocharians legitimacy In return the nationalist party said Justice and its allies should be given seats in the National Security Council to have a say in domestic affairsA Dashnaktsutyun statement said only dialogue would help prevent what it called open confrontation But Justice leader Demirchian yesterday rejected the offer saying the opposition would accept nothing less than the confidence voteHow could we possibly talk about dialogue when opposition members are being arrested Arrests are actions inherent with a junta A real dialogue would have been to call for a national referendum on confidence in Kocharian However there is still room for introducing constitutional amendments that would pave the way for such a referendum Demirchian said Demirchian went on to say the opposition was determined to pursue its antiKocharian campaign regardless of offers made on behalf of the government and despite countersteps taken by the authoritiesI understand the fears of Dashnaktsutyun The situation in the country is indeed tense But the opposition has never asked for any government post Demirchian said What we want is that constitutional order in the country be restored On 31 March the ProsecutorGenerals Office in Yerevan launched criminal proceedings against Justice and its allies which it blamed for a series of recent unsanctioned rallies that purportedly called for a violent change of regime and using what it said was offensive language against senior government officialsThe

Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs INL released its annual review of progress in the global fight against drug trafficking,Prague 9 March 2004 RFERL  On 1 March the US State Departments Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs INL released its annual review of progress in the global fight against drug traffickingThe INLs International Narcotics Control Strategy Report praises recent efforts made by the three South Caucasus republics of Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia in curbing illicit drug trade The three nations are all signatories of the three existing United Nations drugcontrol conventions Since 2001 they have been engaged in the UNsponsored Southern Caucasus AntiDrug program also known as SCAD In addition all three have taken steps to curb trafficking and prevent domestic drug use Armenia last year implemented a law on narcotics and psychotropic substances and is currently working on a draft bill to combat money laundering Also last year thenGeorgian President Eduard Shevardnadze signed into law an antilaundering bill that was strengthened last month by the countrys new leadership Azerbaijan is currently working on a similar legal package that could be approved by parliament by the end of this year The money that is generated by drug smuggling is being used to purchase weapons and ammunition It also serves to finance these separatist regimesYet the INL believes a lot more remains for these countries to do in the fight against drug trafficking especially since they are located in an area that is an important transit route for illicit trade to Western Europe The US agency expresses particular concern regarding Azerbaijan which it says has emerged as a drugtrafficking hub after armed conflicts in former Yugoslavia disrupted traditional routes linking Iran to Western Europe via Turkey and the BalkansInternational experts believe heroin represents up to 80 percent of the illicit drugs transited through the region Opium and marijuana are also smuggledMezahir Efendiyev is Azerbaijans national coordinator for the SCAD program He told RFERL a number of factors are contributing to the regions emergence as a major drugtrafficking route If one takes into account on the one hand the fact that the three South Caucasus countries are geographically located between Asia and Europe and on the other hand the fact that the CIS states represent a major market for heroin it is natural that this route should suit the drug mafias he said This route which originates in Afghanistan and goes to Europe through the South Caucasus and the rest of the CIS is a very easy one In addition these countries acceded to independence roughly 10 years ago and they lack the modern technology that would enable them to prevent drug transit through the South Caucasus area  Pavel Pachta works with the International Narcotics Control Board INCB a Viennabased body that monitors implementation of UN drug conventions worldwide He says the industrial South Caucasus area  which lies at the crossroads of the socalled Balkan Route and its sister Silk Road Route linking Afghanistan to Europe through Central Asia  is important not only as a transit point for drugs but also as a potential provider of chemicals for Afghanbased heroin producersThe countries of the Caucasus are very close to these routes and undoubtedly there have been and there are attempts to use them for smuggling On the one hand drugs are coming from Afghanistan to the markets where there is a demand for them On the other hand chemicals are going in the opposite direction because to manufacture heroin you need chemicals  for example acetic anhydride  and these chemicals are smuggled into Afghanistan Pachta saidThe INCB which released its own annual report on 3 March notes Afghanistans production of opiates increased by 8 percent last year The report blames authorities in neighboring Turkmenistan  a major transit point for Afghanmade narcotics  for failing to cooperate with the international community in the fight against drug trafficking International experts say Afghanproduced drugs reach Azerbaijan the easternmost of the Caucasus republics through two main routes One goes directly through Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea Another crosses the 611kilometerlong land border between Azerbaijan and Iran A third suspected route is the flight path recently opened between Kabul and Baku although the INL says there is so far no evidence to support that theoryWidespread corruption and the various armed conflicts that have plagued the South Caucasus since the late 1980s both contribute to making the region a haven for illicit trafficking Georgia and Azerbaijan have each lost at least a quarter of their territory to separatist conflicts Drugenforcement officials say the selfproclaimed governments now leading these breakaway regions are suspected of profiteering from illegal trade including drug trafficking Authorities in Azerbaijan claim the breakaway enclave of NagornoKarabakh has become not only a favored transit route for drugs smuggled from Iran but also a major heroin production center Mezahir Efendiyev of the UNsponsored SCAD program says international drug experts have been barred from Karabakh by local rulers and are thus unable to verify these claims He also says a significant section of Azerbaijans southern border has been under the control of ethnic Armenian troops for the past decade making it even more difficult for the Azerbaijani government to fight drug trafficking from Iran  Paata Nozadze is SCADs national coordinator for Georgia He says separatist conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have created similar problems for the central government in Tbilisi These socalled hot spots or uncontrolled areas perfectly suit drug traffickers he said The money that is generated by drug smuggling is being used to purchase weapons and ammunition It also serves to finance these separatist regimes This situation perfectly suits drug traffickers because all they have to do is strike a deal with local governments Elsewhere they would have to make separate arrangements with border guards customs officers policemen or state security officials For them these conflict zones are much more advantageousGeorgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on 11 February described Abkhazia as a drugtrafficking corridor prompting a swift protest from the separatist leadership in Sukhum Also last month the recently elected South Caucasus leader  who based his campaign on pledges to fight crime and corruption  launched a security sweep to disarm Georgian guerrillas based in the western Samegrelo Mingrelia region an area that borders Abkhazia The socalled Forest Brothers group is suspected of controlling smuggling activities in the area in conjunction with Abkhaz groups and Russian peacekeepers posted on the other side of the demarcation line that separates the province from the rest of GeorgiaNarcotics reach Georgia from Azerbaijan South Ossetia Turkey and to a lesser extent from Armenia A report prepared in 2002 for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency says illicit drugs are then transited either through Abkhazia the Black Sea port of Poti or Batumi the capital of the autonomous region of Adjaria From there they travel on to Ukraine and RomaniaOnly a small percentage of illegal drugs transiting through the South Caucasus region are seized by law enforcement agencies In Azerbaijan which for two years has been receiving US counternarcotics assistance through the Freedom Support Act the Interior Ministry last year conducted a nationwide operation against drug traffickers and local producers of poppy and cannabis plants SCAD program coordinator Efendiyev says that although Azerbaijan has shown some progress in combating drug trafficking it still has a long way to go Only 10 to 15 percent of drugs that go through Azerbaijan are seized by our law enforcement agencies he said In 2003 they seized over 211 kilograms of narcotic substances and destroyed more than 290 tons of narcotic plants By comparison no plantations were destroyed in Armenia and in Georgia only 34 tons were destroyed This months report by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs notes that although corruption permeates Azerbaijans law enforcement sector there is no evidence that local police officers are participating in the illicit production or distribution of narcotics By contrast in neighboring Georgia a number of police officers were recently arrested and charged with involvement in the narcotics trade The amount of drugs seized in that country remains particularly low Georgias SCAD coordinator Paata Nozadze told RFERL The figures for 2003 are very small They include only 3 kilograms of heroin 83 kilograms of opium and 424 kilograms of marijuana This is all that has officially been seized This is very little The Georgian expert believes a lack of coordination among the agencies involved in the antinarcotics fight could explain why the amount of illegal drugs seized in the country is so small But there could be other reasons A number of counternarcotics officials and policemen suspected of involvement in illicit trade activities were recently arrested in Georgia This suggests that large volumes of contraband drugs are being unofficially seized diverted and resold on the fastexpanding local black market Official statistics say there are just 18000 drug users in Georgia a country of roughly 4 million But independent experts believe the actual number of drug consumers in that country is somewhere between 100000 and 300000

Georgia with being the first country in the region to take anticorruption steps contrary to the generally accepted idea that former President Eduard Shevardnadze encouraged illicit practicesIf one compares efforts undertaken in Azerbaijan Armenia and Georgia to fight corruption one has to admit that Georgia has done much more than the other two countries in that direction Already under President Shevardnadze the government was combating corruption Georgia adopted anticorruption legislation and a national anticorruption program That this did not bring the expected results is a

including the former presidents soninlaw Giorgi Djokhtaberidze  have been arrested in a sweep that also includes many middleranking civil servants with no known political affiliationsThe scope of Saakashvilis anticorruption drive has raised concerns both at home and abroad Georgian critics claim the new ruling team is primarily interested in eliminating political rivals while rights activists blame Saakashvili for using heavyhanded methods Christoph Stefes is an expert on corruption in Georgia and Armenia who teaches political science at the University of Colorado He told RFERL that he too has serious doubts about the new Georgian governments anticorruption measures I havent really seen anything coherent so far I think theyre still working on their anticorruption program What Saakashvili is doing right now in my opinion is a political windowdressing operation Russian President Vladimir Putin did the same when he went after such oligarchs as Vladimir Gusinsky or Boris Berezovsky The Russians loved him for that Similarly the Georgians love Saakashvili for going after Shevardnadzes soninlaw or former energy and transportation ministers Stefes said Saakashvili has justified the recent sweep by saying corruption was so rampant under Shevardnadze that there are no other alternatives Admitting that arrests are not enough to cope with corruption the Georgian leader has also suggested raising salaries for policemen and other public officers in a bid to dissuade them from extorting bribesParliament on 12 February gave first reading approval to new anticorruption legislation that simplifies criminal procedures in corruption cases gives broader powers to lawenforcement agencies and sees reduced prison sentences for police informers Also Georgian lawmakers on 25 February toughened the existing law on money laundering and voted for the creation of a new police force that would be solely responsible for investigating economic crimesTransparencys Safaraliyeva warns that programs mainly aimed at castigating corrupt officials are likely to miss their targets I do not know whether steps that are being taken now in Georgia will ultimately prove efficient she said But lets say that if our government were to emphasize punishment for corruption crimes I would argue that this is not the best solution Punishment cannot be the best solution if it is the only existing method If a state official has committed a crime he must be punished and sentences for corruption crimes can be reasonably envisaged retroactively But if one wants to prevent corruption then punitive methods are by far not the best ones The experience of other countries shows that the best way to prevent corruption is to reform public administration from top to bottom Stefes of the University of Colorado also believes overly punitive anticorruption tactics are likely to be counterproductive because what they do is make corrupt networks look for mutual protection against the governments effortsBy contrast authorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan have adopted lowerprofile tactics The Armenian government on 16 January made public an anticorruption plan aimed at making state institutions more transparent and eliminating redtape bureaucracy The plan also includes recommendations to citizens not to yield to requests for bribes at staterun schools and hospitals as well as rules of conduct for civil servantsBut most Armenians are skeptical of the whole scheme arguing that it lacks any implementation mechanisms and fails to address corruption in many state institutionsStefes says the Armenian government ignored most anticorruption guidelines set by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund instead emphasizing the necessity of raising public awareness Some fundamental reforms that were suggested  such as reforming the police for example  were cut out by the government Public awareness seems to be OK but it is also the least touchy issue he said You can raise public awareness under an authoritarian regime but that does not really matter So I think this is a halfhearted kind of reform It is doing a little bit but obviously the government is not interested in doing much more For President Robert Kocharian the corrupt system that exists in Armenia is perfect to win political support with all these little oligarchs now being in the ruling party and standing behind him That works perfectlyStefes further argues that contrary to Shevardnadze who had virtually no power to implement his initiatives Kocharian has enough leverage on the state apparatus to effectively combat corruption The same goes for Azerbaijan which has been ruled for more than a decade by the powerful Aliyev family clanOn 13 January the Azerbaijani parliament approved an anticorruption law the first of its kind since the country regained independence in 1991 The new legislation which will come into force only next year bars state officials from receiving expensive gifts and entering into business activities either personally or through proxies It also forbids them from holding jobs other than teaching positions and from hiring close relatives Finally it obliges public officers to declare their incomesSafaraliyeva of Transparency said that despite the law having many shortcomings the fact that it was voted is a positive step The greatest merit of this document is that for the first time the notion of corruption as a crime  or lets say as a violation of the law  appears in the legislation she said Before that there existed only the notion of bribery in the Criminal Code But corruption includes a variety of violations of the law Although it is the most widespread of these violations bribery is by far not the only form of corruption and before parliament voted this text other forms of corruption were not punishable by law Like in Armenia the public in Azerbaijan views the new legislation with skepticism Some critics argue President Ilham Aliyev is unlikely to curb corruption unless he changes the government apparatus he inherited from his late father Others believe no anticorruption campaign can be effective unless the country has an independent judiciary Safaraliyeva says her group would also have welcomed the inclusion of civil society members on a new anticorruption commission included as part of the governments recent legislative initiative Yet the proposal says only the executive legislative and judicial branches of power will be represented on that commission From our viewpoint this is a serious mistake Safaraliyeva said Stefes agrees that civil society should be involved in the fight against corruption He cites the modest results achieved by Shevardnadzes anticorruption council  an advisory body made up of journalists academics parliamentarians and rights campaigners which was abolished just a few days ago He says joint action taken by the international community and domestic nongovernmental actors is the best way to force governments to tackle corruption
