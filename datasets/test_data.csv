The ""Ironhorse"" armored cavalry unit, with around 700 soldiers, some 20 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks with Bradley and Stryker armored fighting vehicles, is one of the most formidable U.S. military forces to be sent onto former Soviet soil. Several of the bases and training areas it will operate from were built for the old Soviet Red Army.

The aim is to convince Moscow that - unlike in non-NATO Ukraine - any Russian interference in Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia would put it at war with the Western alliance.

All three countries were once part of the Soviet Union and analysts say Moscow would dearly like to reassert its influence there, particularly in ethnic Russian areas.

Poland too, which was under Soviet domination during the Cold War and is now a NATO and European Union member state like the three Baltic republics, remains distinctly nervous and has lobbied hard for further U.S. forces.

""The purpose is to be a very visible demonstration of commitment to our allies,"" says Captain John Farmer, public affairs officer for the Ironhorse, formal designation of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.

""We may take slightly longer to deploy than lighter forces, but there's nothing like a tank if you really want to achieve effect.""

The U.S. military says it is the first time it has had to ship armored reinforcements to Europe since the end of the Cold War at the start of the 1990s.

The unit was given barely a month's notice it would be sent across the Atlantic from its Texas base to the Baltic states and Poland. Its personnel are now in Germany and starting to move east with their equipment.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The figure is a total for the period August 2016 to January 2017, BBC News reports citing German media.

Turkey has urged Germany not to grant asylum to any military officers. Some posted to Nato bases in Germany are thought to be among the group.

In Greece, two more Turkish soldiers have requested asylum.

The pair - reported to be commandos - are believed to have taken part in the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

They are in Greek police custody, having applied for asylum last week in Orestiada, a small border town near Turkey.

Last month a Greek court rejected Turkey's request to extradite eight other Turkish soldiers who fled after the coup attempt. Turkey is appealing against that ruling.

The German interior ministry did not identify the 136 Turks who requested asylum. Not only diplomats but also their spouses and children hold diplomatic passports.

It is not clear if any of them have been granted asylum yet.

Soldiers who fled after the coup attempt fear that they will not get a fair trial in Turkey.

The Turkish authorities have dismissed at least 100,000 public servants, including teachers, police and members of the judiciary.

Tens of thousands of suspects are in detention. The crackdown is targeting suspected supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in the US.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, with speeding up the accession process, West would have to make certain sacrifices. 



Caucasus is an outpost of the fronts ""open"" for Russia. This is an energy front, since Georgia is the main transit for oil delivery to the Black Sea and then to western Europe. It's an ethnic front with strong Russian minorities. And, finally, it's a military front because Russia rates deployment of a NATO base nearby its border as inadmissible.



According to Le Temps, NATO's restraint is conditioned by the U.S. twofaced policy. The current administration, devoted to Ramsfeld's doctrine on deployment of military bases close to the seat of threat, considers Georgia's - Russia's immediate neighbor - as a possible stationing of U.S. troops. However, the American diplomats do know that Moscow's retaliation will be shattering in two directions: Kosovo, where over 15 thousand NATO military are deployed and the Iranian nuclear program.

""History continues to divide Armenian and Turkish officialdom, but there are many civil society, cultural and academic initiatives aiming to reconnect the two societies. April 24 marks the centennial of the beginning of the mass killings, deportations and dispossession of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915, which resulted in the near-total elimination of Armenians from Anatolia. These massive human rights violations and their painful legacy left a major rift between two societies, which has crystallised around the issue of their political and legal designation as genocide. However, it is heartening to see that today many people are seeking to overcome this difficult legacy and to promote mutual understanding, reconciliation and the reconstruction of a shared history, demonstrating a true human rights,"" the article said.

""Discussion in Turkey of what was sometimes euphemistically called the “1915 Events” was long taboo or even subject to criminal prosecution under the offense of “insulting Turkishness”. In recent years, prosecutions under this article have become more infrequent and a space for discussion has emerged. This space has been created by a number of concurrent developments, particularly increased contacts between Turks and Armenians and domestic Turkish political and cultural evolution.

Though the land border remains closed, nationals of both countries have enjoyed relatively free travel to the neighbouring country.

At the same time, the debate within Turkey about the past has evolved considerably. While an academic conference in Istanbul was a watershed in 2005, since then, a plethora of scholarly work about the Armenian legacy in Turkey has been published. A turning point in the Turkish debate appeared to come with the tragic assassination of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink in 2007, which led to further calls for a reassessment of the past, more open public discussion and a more compassionate tone of discourse. In a sign of this new tone, intellectuals in Turkey organised a petition campaign in 2008, in which thousands signed an apology to Armenians for the ""Great Catastrophe"","" the article said.

As Karen Bekaryan told a news conference in Yerevan, Ankara operations against PKK remind the annihilation policy of Ottoman Turks towards Armenians. “In the early 20th century, Turkish authorities carried out their plan of ethnical cleansing on the backdrop of international issues and a war. Clearly, in modern days, Turkish government applies the same principle to Kurds,” the experts said.

At least 31 soldiers were killed in two attacks on Friday, Oct 24, the deadliest a bomb blast near the town of El-Arish.

A three-month state of emergency has been declared in parts of the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt's Rafah crossing into the Gaza Strip was closed. There will be three days of mourning.

In a live TV address, Sisi said a huge plot was being waged against Egypt ""by external forces"".

""This is meant to break up Egypt and the Egyptians .... Egypt is fighting a war of existence.""

No group has said it carried out the attacks, which came as the army continued an offensive against jihadists in northern Sinai. The area has become increasingly lawless since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011.

Militants have stepped up attacks since Islamist President Mohammed Morsi was ousted by the army last year amid massive opposition protests.

In the deadliest attack, 28 soldiers were killed and a similar number injured in a suicide bomb blast at a checkpoint near El-Arish, the main town in the north of the restive peninsula. Three more soldiers died in a separate shooting at a checkpoint in the town itself.

The state of emergency, which began at 03:00 GMT on Saturday, centers on the north and center of the peninsula, a presidential statement said, according to the BBC.

The decision was made after Sisi called a meeting of the National Defense Council to discuss the security situation.

""The army and the police will take all necessary measures to tackle the dangers of terrorism and its financing, to preserve the security of the region... and protect the lives of citizens,"" the statement said.

In their continuing offensive in northern Sinai, security forces have recently killed and captured dozens of suspected members of jihadist groups.

In September at least 11 policemen were killed in a bomb attack on a convoy in the peninsula as it travelled through the village of Wefaq, near the Gaza border. That bombing was claimed by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the most active militant group in Egypt. It attempted to kill the interior minister in Cairo in 2013 in a car bomb attack and has issued videos of the beheading of captives.

Officials with the Geneva-based organisation are angry over increasing seizures of aid intended for Palestinians living in the Jordan Valley who have been left homeless after Israeli forces carried out demolition orders.

""We are suspending the distribution of shelter materials because we have seen a pattern of obstacles and confiscations,"" Jon Larrson, the ICRC's spokesman, told The Telegraph. ""It's a difficult decision for us. We are hoping to re-issue shelter assistance as soon as possible in dialogue with the Israeli authorities. We will resume when we get the message that our shelter materials will no longer be confiscated.""

The ICRC will continue to deliver other forms of aid, he added.

The move comes after UN figures showed the number of Palestinian properties knocked down in the Jordan Valley due to lack of proper planning permission doubled last year - up to 390 compared to 172 in 2012.

Last week, the army destroyed tents and huts belonging to a herding community in Umm al-Jamal in the northern Jordan Valley, leaving 66 people - including 36 children - unhoused. Soldiers reportedly returned the following day to make sure there was no attempt to re-build.

In a joint statement on Thursday, Feb 6 25 international aid groups complained of ""increasingly severe restrictions"" in delivering assistance to Palestinians whose properties have been demolished in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Sixty-five aid items - including tents - were confiscated last year, the statement said, ""in violation of Israel's obligation to facilitate the effective delivery of aid"".

Some of the destruction has been of structures used to house livestock.

Residents say the demolitions are aimed at driving the Palestinian population out of the Jordan Valley, which has become a major stumbling block in on-going peace negotiations.

Israel insists that its troops should remain indefinitely in the area - which also home to around 4,500 settlers - after any deal. Right-wingers in Benjamin Netanyahu's government have called for it to be formally annexed, even though the Palestinians have earmarked it as part of a future state.

Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, has said he will not countenance the permanent presence of Israeli forces, leaving John Kerry, the US secretary of state, to seek a compromise.

The ICRC's decision comes after hundreds of Palestinian activists set up a protest camp aimed at demonstrating opposition to Israeli demands on the site of an ancient Canaanite village near the Jordanian border.

The camp, which has been established on land belonging to a Christian monastery, St Gerasimos, has been monitored round-the-clock by Israeli soldiers since protesters began arriving on Jan 31.

""We are sending a message to Mr Kerry and the United States that we cannot have an independent and real state without the Jordan Valley,"" said Moustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator who is one of the protest organisers. ""Any Israeli military or settlement presence here will mean we are not having a state because the Jordan Valley has the most important water resources. It is also our border. If the Israelis control the water and the border, we will not have a viable economy.""",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

State forces withdrew from the Mastouma base after days of fighting, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, according to BBC News.

The assault on Idlib is run by a coalition of Islamist rebels, including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Meanwhile Islamic State (IS) militants are again reported to be threatening the town of Palmyra.

Residents reported that IS militants had moved into the town's northern quarters, after being driven out late last week.

Syrian state media implicitly acknowledged the loss of the Mastouma base, saying its forces had heavily pounded ""terrorist formations"" which had infiltrated the camp.

Government forces have headed to Ariha, one of the few towns they still hold in the province, according the British-based Observatory.

The capture tightens rebel control on Idlib. The grouping seized the provincial capital in March. It also brings them closer to the coastal province of Latakia, a stronghold of President Assad.

The rebels are thought to have been aided by a new alliance between Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all of whom want Assad ousted.

The crossing is open for pedestrians, but only within limited hours for vehicles.

Local press reported that some 200 Brazilians, mostly local tourists, were prevented from returning home when Venezuela closed the border.

President Nicolas Maduro had ordered the borders with Colombia and Brazil be closed December 12 as part of a currency reform that involved removing the 100-bolivar note from circulation.

Maduro alleged ""mafias"" abroad were hoarding the banknotes to try to suffocate the Venezuelan economy.

Bolivar was the state hit hardest by the unrest. A curfew has been in force there since Saturday, and more than 3,000 troops are patrolling the streets.

Heavily outgunned defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of the mainly Kurdish border city late on Wednesday, despite U.S.-led air strikes that the Pentagon acknowledged would probably not be enough to safeguard the town.

In Turkey, street battles raged between Kurdish protesters and police across the mainly Kurdish southeast, in Istanbul and in Ankara, as fallout from war in Syria and Iraq threatened to unravel the NATO member's own delicate Kurdish peace process. The street violence was the worst Turkey had seen in years.

Washington said on Wednesday night that the U.S. military and partner nations carried out eight air strikes against Islamic State fighters near the embattled Syrian city of Kobani, which it said was still under the control of Kurdish militia.

""U.S. Central Command continues to monitor the situation in Kobani closely. Indications are that Kurdish militia there continue to control most of the city and are holding out against ISIL,"" the Pentagon statement said, using another acronym for Islamic State.

Central Command added that the strikes, in which Jordan took part, destroyed several Islamic State targets, including five armed vehicles, a supply depot, a command-and-control compound, a logistics compound and eight occupied barracks. The United States also launched three strikes against Islamic State in Iraq.

But Kobani remained under intense bombardment from Islamic State emplacements, within sight of Turkish tanks at the nearby frontier that have so far done nothing to help.

""Tonight, (Islamic State) has entered two districts with heavy weapons including tanks. Civilians may have died because there are very intense clashes,"" Asya Abdullah, co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), the main Kurdish group defending the area, told Reuters from inside the town.

The conflict in Blue Nile started in September 2011, a few months after neighboring South Sudan seceded under a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war.

Rebels in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, another Sudanese border state, fought as part of the southern rebel army during that war, but were left on the Sudanese side of the border after partition.

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes because of the fighting since 2011.

The army killed 66 rebels, it said, quoting the armed forces spokesman al-Sawarmi Khalid. The armed forces suffered a ""small number"" of casualties, it said, without giving details.

The rebels, known as the SPLM-North, said the Sudanese armed forces and allied militia had started a ""military dry season campaign"" on February 14 in a heavily populated area at Muffa.

It said the fighting had forced thousands of civilians to flee toward Ethiopia and South Sudan.

Events in the two states are difficult to verify independently because of government restrictions on media, and the two sides often give conflicting versions of the fighting.

Some 2 million people died in Sudan's north-south civil war, which ended in 2005 with the peace deal that paved the way for South Sudan's independence.

Greece has been the main gateway for nearly a million migrants who have crossed the Aegean Sea from Turkey over the past year on their way to wealthier northern Europe.

The influx has prompted Austria and others along the Balkans migration corridor to impose restrictions on their borders, meaning at least 30,000 people fleeing conflict of poverty in the Middle East are now trapped in Greece.

""Greece will have until May to protect its external borders,"" Avramopoulos, a former Greek government minister, told Die Welt newspaper.

""We will take stock of the situation on May 12. Should we see no success by then we will not hesitate to create requirements so that border controls in Europe can be extended,"" he said.

Avramopoulos told the paper the aim was to lift all border controls that have been instated as a result of the migrant crisis within the passport-free Schengen zone by November.

The EU Commission also plans to present initial plans to reform the Dublin regulation that states that asylum requests be handled where asylum is first claimed in mid-March.

""We are sticking to plans for a permanent distribution mechanism for refugees. It will be associated with the Dublin reform plans. In addition, we will present plans on how asylum standards in Europe can be further harmonized,"" he said.

Immigration officials retained the passports of the Amnesty staff, both Georgian nationals, after they flew into the capital Baku this morning. They were deported hours later. Amnesty had informed the authorities well in advance of their visit but never received a reply.

John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia said there is simply no real chance of people being able to take part meaningfully in elections while the human rights crackdown continues and Azerbaijan’s few independent voices are being silenced.

“What other dark secrets are the Azerbaijani authorities trying to conceal from the outside world before the parliamentary election?” Dalhuisen questions. “The deportation of our staff adds to a sad litany of journalists and human rights defenders being targeted, detained and jailed simply for carrying out their work. There is no let-up in the government’s repressive campaign to stifle all criticism and dissent.”

In June this year Amnesty staff were barred from entering Azerbaijan just a day before a planned visit in the run up to the European Games, which Baku hosted. Baku is due to host Formula 1 next year and four games in the European Football Championships in 2020.

Last month election monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) cancelled their plans to observe the election on 1 November after the authorities placed too many restrictions on them. It will be the first election the OSCE will not monitor in oil-rich Azerbaijan since it gained its independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed.

In a further sign of the severity of the human rights situation, the Council of Europe, Europe’s main human rights body, announced Wednesday it is withdrawing its representative from the joint working group on human rights in Azerbaijan. The group had been tasked with reviving dialogue between the authorities and civil society.

There are at least 20 prisoners of conscience in Azerbaijan, locked up for criticizing or challenging the authorities. They have been convicted on spurious charges ranging from fraud and tax evasion, to drugs possession, hooliganism and in some cases even treason.

Many other activists and campaigners have fled the country, while those who remain are often too fearful, because of threats to themselves or their families, to speak out against human rights violations committed by the authorities.

China tightens border controls with North Korea",5/26/2017,5/26/2017,"China, North Korea",China has tightened inspection and policing on the border of North Korea after US pressure and seeing nuclear tests by the North Koreans.,"Chinese officials have told the U.S. that they've tightened inspections and policing along the border with North Korea as part of U.N. sanctions aimed at halting Pyongyang's nuclear and missile activities, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia said Friday, May 26, The Associated Press reports.

Beijing's action reflects a growing awareness about the urgent need for China to pressure North Korea into halting its testing of missiles and nuclear bombs, Acting Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton told reporters in Beijing. President Donald Trump's administration has made a renewed push to enlist Beijing's help in those efforts following a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month.

Touching on other areas of the relationship, Thornton said the new administration has not changed its commitment to greater engagement with countries in the Asia-Pacific region or its approach to naval operations in the disputed South China Sea.

On North Korea, the U.S. has seen a ""shift in emphasis"" in China's approach to its fellow communist neighbor, Thornton said.

""They've said that they have stepped up border inspections, beefed up sort of the policing function on the border, stepped up customs inspections,"" she said. Beijing has also done ""a number of other things on companies"" that have dealings with North Korea, Thornton said, without giving details.

The U.S. has been talking to Beijing about taking action against specific firms and is waiting to see what sort of action China will take, she said.

China has signed on to U.N. sanctions and suspended coal imports from North Korea through the rest of the year, but has been generally reticent about what other steps it may be taking to use its leverage as Pyongyang's most important trading and diplomatic partner.

Asked about Thornton's remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China remained committed to ""strictly implementing"" U.N. sanctions but offered no details or what other measures it might be taking.

Lu also reiterated China's call for a renewal of six-nation denuclearization talks that have been on ice since 2009, saying the parties should ""be flexible, meet each other halfway, and return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.""

The two leaders are meating. Armenians see inaction as important to not allow Turkey and Russia a reason to cooperate.,"Ankara resorts to all kinds of tricks striving to become a regional leader; it declares a “zero problem” policy, then adopts a “reasonable power” concept. According to Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey will respond to Syria’s actions with weighed moves, with no rash decisions. The reality, however, is somewhat different: organization of camps for Syrian refugees, who then are recruited as militants to fight against Bashar al-Assad; weapon supply to the opposition, cheat games with Iran, etc...

Relations with Armenia are of least importance here, and this is good for Yerevan. Ankara knows perfectly well that Russia views Armenia as a quite friendly state, and any moves against Armenia will be perceived by Moscow as antagonism to its ally. Maybe this is the reason that support to Azerbaijan is merely manifested by Erdogan’s loud statements, like “Our brothers’ pain is our pain” and the hackneyed “The border will be opened when Armenian troops leave Karabakh” phrases. Both Ankara and Baku realize the value of these statements; they are worth nothing; instead, they please the self-esteem demonstrating the “invariability of policy towards the enemy”, namely Armenia.

Now, back to Russian-Turkish relations. The Turkish side recently initiated a telephone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “The parties discussed the situation in and around Syria, including the recent tragic incident with Turkish military aircraft hit by Syrian air defence. The circumstances of this incident need thorough investigation, the parties stressed,” Kremlin’s press service reported.

Meanwhile, Erdogan is arriving in Moscow for a one-day visit to meet the Russian leader. The negotiation agenda will include further development of bilateral relations, including the preparation for the third meeting of the Russian-Turkish top level Cooperation Council due in Turkey in autumn. In particular, cooperation in the energy sphere will be a major subject of talks.

Today, Turkey needs to ensure support by both U.S. and Russia, which is now regaining the status of a world power.

Actually, it never lost the status; however, recent years saw some westernization trends. With Putin’s comeback, despite the global and domestic attitude to him, Russia is gradually trying to regain at least some of the positions it has so far lost. The efforts should first focus on Near East where the U.S. increasingly reinforces its presence, breeding chaos and discord between nations. As to Turkey, as always, it is the first to see which way the wind blows, and tries to minimize the losses. This is no “reasonable power” any longer, but an urge to gain at least something. This is namely what Erdogan’s visit to Moscow proves. If they fail to “settle” the Syrian issue the way U.S. plans, Ankara will have to follow Russia’s rules, and also the Chinese ones, to some extent. All in all, the underlying basis of the “Arab spring” is the mere control over energy carriers.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the smugglers, 481, were caught on the Austrian border by December 2016. On the borders with Poland and Czech Republic, 155 and 106 people were arrested respectively. Forty five arrests were made on the Belgian border, and almost 90 traffickers were caught entering from France. Germany’s airport security registered 23 arrests for 2016.

The national makeup of detained traffickers places Syrians first, followed by Poles, Germans, Iraqi’s, and Russians. Authorities have not revealed the number of actual convictions in any of the cases.

Despite the staggering number of arrests, rates of human trafficking has actually dropped from the record-breaking 2015, when all of Europe was overwhelmed by an all-out refugee and migration route crisis.

The German Federal Police detained 3,370 suspects in 2015, according to the German paper.

Authorities say the decrease in migration to Germany is as a result of the closure of the Balkan route which used to be most popular passageway into EU, until the bloc negotiated an agreement with Turkey to send those crossing illegally back.

A heated debate is ongoing in the EU over migration policies coinciding with increased terrorist acts and threats. The latest terror attack that struck a Berlin Christmas market has heightened security concerns, as has the multiple other strikes across the EU in recent years.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has particularly been singled out, drawing strong criticism from political rivals and even allies, as well the general populace for her so called ‘open-door’ immigration policy which resulted in over 1 million migrants entering Germany in 2015. This has sparked anti-immigration protests and radical proposals such as that from the Christian Social Union (CSU), and of course, the far-right AfD.

The CSU is championing a program called ‘Germany must remain Germany’, reportedly authored by the Prime Minister of the southern state of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer. The document, according to a report by local Munich media, seeks to impose stricter limits on entrance than those of Merkel’s CDU government.

Video footage showed fighters identified as members of an al Qaeda-linked Islamist brigade waving from the roof of an army tower in the village of Barouda, one of several Alawite villages attacked by the rebels on Sunday.

The mainly Sunni Muslim rebels are battling to overthrow Assad, whose minority Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam, in a civil war which erupted two years ago when mainly peaceful protests against his rule were put down with force.

Assad, with support from Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, has gained ground in recent months from the rebel fighters who are backed by regional Sunni Muslim powers but remain largely outgunned by his army.

The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 12 rebels and 19 pro-Assad fighters - including soldiers and members of his militia known as the National Defense Army - were killed in Sunday's fighting in the mountains of east Latakia province.

A source in Latakia said the fighting started at dawn and that the rebels, based in the town of Salma, attacked 10 Alawite villages.

Ambulance sirens, punctuated by the sound of bombardment and government air raids on Salma, could be heard throughout the day, he said.

Tunisia, economically struggling and deeply polarized between Islamists and their opponents, is in the throes of a political transition that began with the overthrow of strongman Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in a popular uprising two years ago.

The Islamist-led government is struggling to restore stability following the assassination of secular opposition figure Chokri Belaid on February 6 which provoked widespread unrest.

The security source said Tuesday's clash took place in the northwest town of Tajrouin, in Kef province, between the army and six members of a ""terrorist group"". There were no immediate reports of casualties.

The source said the militants were Salafists, who adhere to a puritanical interpretation of Islam, but did not specify their nationalities.

The cause of the fighting was unclear, but security forces have been attempting to track down al Qaeda-linked militants near the borders with Algeria and Libya over the past six weeks.

They suspect the fighters are attempting to bring weapons into the country from Algeria, where Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is active, and from Libya, which has been unstable since a 2011 revolution.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plane crashed in a Namibian national park near the border with Angola and there were no survivors, said Namibian deputy police commissioner Bollen Sankwasa. An investigation of the cause was underway.

The plane was carrying 27 passengers, including 10 Mozambicans, nine Angolans, five Portuguese, and one citizen each from France, Brazil and China, said the airline. Six crew members were on board.

Flight TM470 from Maputo, the Mozambican capital, did not land as scheduled in Luanda, the Angolan capital, on Friday afternoon, and the airline initially said the plane might have landed in Rundu, in northern Namibia. It said it coordinated with aviation authorities in Namibia, Botswana and Angola to locate the missing plane.

A Namibian police helicopter joined officers on the ground in the search. The area is vast and there are no roads, making it difficult to locate the plane, said police official Willy Bampton, according to the Namibian Press Agency.

The search was conducted in the Bwabwata National Park in northeastern Namibia. Several thousand people as well as elephants, buffalo and other wildlife live in the park, which covers 6,100 square kilometers (2,360 square miles).

Airlines from Mozambique are among carriers banned in the European Union because of safety concerns.

Tony Tyler, director general and CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said earlier this week that none of the 25 African members of the association, which include Mozambique Airlines, had an accident in 2012.

""But the overall safety record for Africa remains a problem that we must fix,"" Tyler said at a meeting of the African Airlines Association in Kenya, accordihng to the AP. He said African aviation comprises about 3 percent of global airline traffic, and last year it accounted for nearly half of the fatalities on Western-built jets.

Mozambique Airlines uses Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft.

CEO Marlene Mendes Manave said in a statement on the airline's website that the airline grew 8 percent in the first half of this year, compared to the same period in 2012.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/politics/details/46863/,Armenian President’s oncoming visit to US triggers internal political discussions,4/10/2010,4/5/2010,N/A,Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan is about to see the United States after going to Europe. This is creating questions on relations with Turkey and questions on the conflict in South Caracascus.,"“Turks refuse to acknowledge the 1915 events as Genocide but this is not an issue for Ankara to decide,” Armenian leader stated. “Threats to exile illegal Armenian migrants are not new; they awaken my nation’s bitter memories about the Genocide. The international community - the US, Europe and specifically Germany, all the countries involved in the process of the Armenian-Turkish reconciliation - should publicly express their position on the issue. Worldwide recognition of the Armenian Genocide could prevent Turkish officials from making such statements. Meanwhile, protest actions organized by youth representatives in Turkey inspire with hope. A new generation is growing up there, and the political leadership shall take into consideration its opinion,” the RA President noted.

Mr. Sargsyan also said that a historical commission cannot work impartially, if people are persecuted and condemned for the use of term Genocide in Turkey. “It is important for Ankara to prolong the process of decision-making. This way, when parliaments or governments of other countries try to adopt Genocide resolutions, Turkey will be able to say: ‘do not interfere, look, our historians are solving these issues’. Creation of such commission would mean questioning the fact of the Genocide perpetrated against our people. It is unacceptable for us. The establishment of such a commission would have been reasonable, if Turkey admitted its guilt. In such case, historians could jointly study the reasons, which had resulted in this tragedy. Armenian Genocide recognition is an issue of historical justice and our national security. The best way to prevent repetition of this horrible crime is its condemnation. At the same time, Turkey is scared by possible territorial claims and indemnity obligations. Nobody can deprive us of Ararat, which is in our hearts. You will definitely find a picture of Ararat in the house of any Armenian living in any corner of the world. I believe that the time will come when Ararat will not be a symbol of separation but will embody mutual understanding between the two peoples. However, I should specify the following: none of Armenian officials has ever presented territorial claims to Turkey. Turks themselves assign this to us, maybe due to acknowledgement of the guilt. We do not correlate the Genocide recognition with the opening of the border. And it is not our fault that the reconciliation does not take place. Turks permanently want us to yield, which is impossible. The execution of the NKR people’s right to self-determination is a very important issue. If Azerbaijan recognizes NKR independence, I think it will be possible to resolve the issue within several hours. Unfortunately, Azerbaijan is still thinking of regaining NKR, what, have no doubt, will result in total eviction of Armenians from Karabakh during a short period of time,” Mr. Sargsyan said.

He also reminded that the countries of former Yugoslavia managed to get independence. “Then why can’t Karabakh exercise the same rights? Is Azerbaijan’s oil and gas along with Turkey’s protection the only reason for it? In our opinion, this is unfair,” the Armenian President concluded.

Cooperation with the European Union is one of priorities on Armenia’s foreign policy agenda, RA top diplomat said on April 6.

“The interest is mutual, what can be proved by frequent visit of EU officials to Armenia,” Edward Nalbandian said during a joint press conference with Stefan Fule, the EU Commissioner for Enlargement and the European Neighborhood Policy.

“Mr. Fule’s visit is a good opportunity to discuss Armenia-EU agenda and ways to strengthen cooperation on the threshold of President Sargsyan’s trip to Brussels,” he said.

“The European Union is Armenia’s reliable political and economic partner. Thereat, we attach special importance to signing of a free trade agreement, relaxation of visa requirements and launch of negotiations on association agreement,” the Armenian Minister said.

He also voiced hope that Armenia-EU cooperation will develop within the Eastern Partnership initiative.

For his part, Mr. Fule noted that the European Union wishes stability and development for EU’s eastern neighbors. “We are glad that our cooperation with Armenia is developing gradually and reaches a new level. I hope that talks on association agreement will start in near future and I hope that a part of this agreement will be the so-called economic integration, that is deep and comprehensive free trade agreement, a strong tool that the EU offers to Armenia to help it integrate in European markets. We also touched upon the support the EU renders to reform process in Armenia,” he said.

As to the new visa code, Mr. Fule said it was made “to provide EU partners with more transparency and predictability.” “It’s an important step to unifying with the European countries. I am hopeful that the new visa code will be helpful for Armenian citizens,” he said.

Discussion of the draft law submitted by the ARF Dashnaktsutyun parliamentary group on announcing April 24 a Day of Fatherland’s Demands is postponed for 30 days.

Tuesday, April 6 PanARMENIAN.Net correspondent in the parliament reported that although the project got a negative inference from the Standing Committee on Education, Science and Youth Affairs, the ARFD insists on including the draft law in the spring session agenda.

Head of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) parliamentary group Galust Sahakyan noted during the debates that April 24 is already marked by the Armenian people as a day of commemoration and grief and there is no need to attach another name to it.

Meanwhile, ARF Dashnaktsutyun representative Artyusha Shahbazyan stated that the RPA “has forgotten the values professed by Garegin Nzhdeh that are fixed in the party's program.”

Tuesday, April 6, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy Stefan Fule said that the European Union is ready to facilitate the process of the Armenian-Turkish protocols ratification without any preconditions. The EU is ready to contribute to the development of frontier regions, as soon as the Protocols are signed and come into force, Stefan Fule said during a joint press conference with RA Foreign Affairs Minister Edward Nalbandian. At the same time, he highly appreciated the activity and courage of the Armenian President who agreed to establish a dialogue with Turkey. According to Fule, the restoration of the Armenian-Turkish relations may have a positive impact also on Turkey's bid for EU membership.

Referring to the process of the NKR conflict settlement, Fule said that the EU not only supports the OSCE Minsk Group activity, but also is ready to develop certain programs for restoration of trust both in Nagorno Karabakh and in the region.

RA Foreign Minister, in turn, noted that Armenia's position concerning the NKR status recognition has not changed. “Both Armenia and the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs understand that the Karabakh people's right to self-determination is the main issue in the Karabakh conflict settlement,” said Nalbandian, commenting on possible change in the country's position towards the NKR status recognition. According to Mr. Nalbandian, within this context, the Armenian President's statement that it will be possible to resolve the conflict during a couple of hours, if Azerbaijan recognizes the NKR independence, implies right this. “If this main issue is resolved, it will be much easier to discuss the others,” noted Nalbandian.

Tuesday, April 6, Head of the Analytical Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation Stepan Grigoryan said that the threat of resumption of hostilities in Karabakh exists, increasing periodically.

“Azerbaijan’s threats to use of force have nothing to do with the Karabakh conflict. They target Armenia-Turkey rapprochement process. Opening of Armenian-Turkish border will be deadly for Azerbaijan,” Mr. Grigoryan stated during a joint news conference with political scientist Alexander Manasyan.

Yet, according to him, Karabakh conflict will not be resolved unless the superpowers reach agreement on the issue. “The European Union is interested in resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Russia is not, Obama remains undecided on South Caucasus policy,” Mr. Grigoryan noted.

For his part, Alexander Manasyan said that Baku will not venture a new war without permission of the major world powers.

There’s no sense in referring to other problems unless the status of Nagorno Karabakh is determined, according to Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian.

“Affirmation of Nagorno Karabakh people’s right to self-determination is the main point in talks,” he told a news conference in Yerevan on April 7.

“Madrid Principles are still serving as a basis for negotiations and the OSCE Minsk Group will continue proposing solutions until the conflicting parties reach a comprehensive agreement,” Minister Nalbandian said.

The ongoing process between Armenia and Turkey is unfavorable for the RA but withdrawal from it would be extremely inexpedient, according to Hovhannes Igityan, chairman of the Armenian National Movement board.

“If the international community brings more pressure on Armenia and Turkey, both will ratify the protocols. Nevertheless, Armenia and Turkey are still unprepared to normalize relations and open the border,” he told reporters in Yerevan on April 7.

As to the forthcoming Sargsyan-Obama meeting in Washington D.C., Mr. Igityan that the U.S. President will try to urge Armenia upon concessions over Karabakh to inspire Turkey to take action towards normalization.

Commenting on the Karabakh issue, he said that the OSCE is determined to resolve the conflict in favor of Azerbaijan.

Shakaryan also noted that Sinirlioglu is the first high-ranking official of Turkey, who visited Armenia after the signing of the Armenian-Turkish Protocols in Zurich on October 10, 2009.

The Armenian expert stressed that Sinirlioglu was in the US at the beginning of this week. “Probably, he wanted to clarify the stance of Washington with respect to the Armenian-Turkish process,” Shakaryan said.

On April 7, the Special Envoy conveyed a written message of the Turkish Prime Minister, as well as President Abdullah Gul’s verbal message to the Armenian President.

“Armenia expects practical steps on behalf of Turkey that would allow for normalization of bilateral ties without preconditions and help achieve a breakthrough in the negotiations,” Mr. Sargsyan said. The Turkish diplomat in turn noted that Turkey is ready to secure soonest ratification of the Armenian-Turkish Protocols.

Sinirlioglu also conveyed an offer about Erdogan's and Sargsyan's meeting in Washington within the framework of global nuclear security summit due on April 12-13.

Armenia's Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian said on April 7 that Azerbaijan has repeatedly accepted Karabakh as a party to negotiations on Karabakh conflict resolution – both de facto and de jure, as Azerbaijan signed ceasefire agreement with NKR. The sooner Karabakh returns to the negotiations process, the more the process will gain, Mr. Nalbandian said during a governmental hour in RA parliament, answering the question of Artak Zakaryan, Republican Party parliamentary group member.

Meanwhile, commenting on the question of Stepan Safaryan, the head of Heritage parliamentary group, about possible trilateral meeting between Sargsyan, Obama and Erdogan, Nalbandian said that no offer as to the meeting was received. According to him, currently, possible Sargsyan-Erdogan meeting is being discussed. “Rumors on the possibility of Karabakh issue being discussed at Sargsyan -Erdogan meeting are untrue,” the Foreign Minister stressed.

During a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister’s envoy Feridun Sinirlioglu on April 7, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan accepted the offer to meet with Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, DC, RA President’s spokesman Armen Arzumanyan told PanARMENIAN.Net

Armenian President’s meeting with Turkish Prime Minister in Washington may have a positive effect on the rapprochement process, according to a member of the Republican Party of Armenia, (RPA).

“I don’t suppose that April 24 is the deadline for ratification of Protocols. It’s incorrect to set terms when neither the state systems nor nations are prepared for reconciliation,” Artak Zakaryan told a PanARMENIAN.Net reporter during a news conference in Yerevan on April 8.

“The Armenian-Turkish process will be ruined if the sides fail to find common ground. Diplomatic terms for ratification of Protocols have expired, however, the mechanism of ‘reasonable political terms’ is still in order.

There is a high possibility of resumption of hostilities in Karabakh, as the talks reached a deadlock, according to Major General Arkady Ter-Tadevosyan, Commandos.

“The conflicting parties are trying to merge irreconcilable contradictions – the principle of territorial integrity and the right of nations to self-determination. Additional tension is created by the Armenian-Turkish rapprochement process. At that, failure of the dialogue will increase the possibility of war,” he said when responding to a PanARMENIAN.Net reporter’s question during a press conference on April 8.

“Azerbaijan and Turkey have been coordinating their foreign policies since 1919. I can’t say for sure that war will start this May but it will start anyway - if not this year, then next year for certain,” Commandos said.

*

The efficiency of the Armenian army guarantees security of Armenian and Karabakh people, said Major General Arkady Ter-Tadevosyan, Commandos.

“The efficiency of any army is determined by experts’ assessments but not by self-laudation. Our army is assessed highly. As to the Azeri army, it was a mistake of Azerbaijan’s leadership to reorganize the armed forces for three times,” he told a news conference in Yerevan.

He also noted that Armenian army is monoethnic unlike that of Azerbaijan, where national minorities are oppressed.

“Not weapons but the spirit is the most important factor. We struggled for independence in hard conditions but we were strong. Besides, we can manage military hardware. Our armed forces can parry provocations and rebuff any attack,” the Major General said.

Chairman of the Labor Party of Armenia, entrepreneur Gurgen Arsenyan stated that Armenia’s national initiatives have failed during the past 300 years.

“To achieve success, Yerevan should present its interests in a state format, as it’s done by Ankara and Baku,” he told reporters on April 8. “People’s security should be a priority for Armenia.”

Commenting on the Armenian-Turkish relations, he said these resemble a minefield. “We should be extremely careful to prevent explosion while the process of ratification of Protocols is going on both in Armenia and Turkey,” he said.

Dwelling on the domestic situation, Mr. Arsenyan said that the authorities and opposition should demonstrate political will. “The President should declare new amnesty and release people who were arrested for their political views,” he said, adding that his party doesn’t support the idea of extra elections in Armenia.

International nuclear security summit is scheduled for April 12-13 in Washington, with a meeting planned between Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the course of the summit.

There’s noting unexpected about Serzh Sargsyan’s agreeing to meet the Turkish Premier in Washington, Heritage parliamentary group leader Stepan Safaryan said on April 9.

As he told a news conference in Yerevan, “Armenia can’t withdraw from reconciliation as it’s not the only participant of rapprochement process. Any steps in this direction could entail negative consequences.”

“Still, despite possible attempts to present the meeting as a step towards reconciliation, Armenia-Turkey Protocols ratification process has already exhausted itself,” Stepan Safaryan emphasized.

Orinats Yerkir parliamentary group leader Heghine Bisharyan, however, characterized the oncoming meeting as a signal of readiness to ratify protocols without preconditions.

“Armenian leader’s agreement to meet Prime Minister Erdogan proves that RA government’s initiative policy is open to consider any solutions proposed,” ARF Dashnaktsutyun parliamentary group leader Artsvik Minasyan stated.

“Turkey will attempt to push forward the rapprochement process, as well as Karabakh issue, aiming to work on fulfillment of its precondition on Karabakh settlement,” he emphasized.

RPA parliamentary group leader Galust Sahakan stressed that RA President’s meeting with Turkish Prime Minister enables Turkey to demonstrate its interest in proceeding with reconciliation.

Still, as he noted, reasonable time –frames, stipulated for Armenia-Turkey ratification have long been expired, so even now, Armenia is ready to withdraw its signature. “Armenia, however, has to pick a favorable time to do so,” he concluded.

*

The U.S. needs an uninterrupted Armenian-Turkish process till April 24, an Armenian expert said.

“To prevent failure of the dialogue, the U.S. exerts pressure on both countries. It’s notable that Azerbaijani President was not invited to the Nuclear Security Summit. This move signals to Armenian political elite on the isolation of Karabakh conflict from Armenian-Turkish relations,” Director of Caucasus Institute Alexander Iskandaryan told a news conference on April 9.

He presumed that Washington will probably ask Ankara for a partial opening of the Armenian-Turkish border but excluded a possibility of ratification of Protocols before April 24.

Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan said that the possibility of resumption of hostilities in Nagorno Karabakh has always persisted.

“The threat of resumption of hostilities will persist until stability is established in the region,” Mr. Sargsyan told journalists in Tavush region on April 9.

At the same time, he noted that the danger of war becomes more substantial for the Armenian people in two cases – when Azerbaijan, having no other way to resolve the problem, resorts to militaristic statements, and when internal political forces exploit this issue. “I do not know what makes Baku use the language of threats, as I do not see its superiority over us,” President Sargsyan said, adding that he does not see the threat of a new war in the near future.

Referring to the current negotiation process over the Karabakh conflict settlement, the Armenian President estimated it as “normal.” “I have repeatedly stated that the key to the Karabakh conflict settlement is in our hands,” he said, adding that if the issue on the NKR people's right to self-determination is settled, it would be much easier to address the others.

Armen Martirosyan, Chairman of the Board of Heritage party, said that no progress has been recorded in the country since Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s inauguration two years ago.

“Those, who are guilty of 10 people’s death during the March 1, 2008, tragic events, have not been revealed, all political prisoners have not been released, while the judicial system of the country continues implementing political orders,” Martirosyan said during a briefing in the RA National Assembly on April 9.

In her turn, head of Orinats Yerkir parliamentary group Heghine Bisharyan noted that during Serzh Sargsyan's presidency the tense internal political situation in Armenia, conditioned by the March 1 events, has rather alleviated. Besides, Armenia has recorded an unprecedented progress in the foreign political sphere, she noted.

“The tense internal political situation was alleviated over two years, but due to a change in Armenian citizens’ attitude towards the reality and not due to the leadership’s efforts,” member of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun parliamentary group Artsvik Minasyan said during the briefing.

According to Minasyan, despite the relatively stable internal political situation in the country, the situation is extremely tense in the foreign policy sphere with respect to the Armenian President's initiative policy. “The tense situation in the foreign political sphere may have a negative impact on the internal situation in Armenia,” he noted.

Member of Prosperous Armenia parliamentary group Naira Zohrabyan noted that Armenia has recorded a progress in the foreign political sphere, as normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations has switched onto a normal track and active negotiations are conducted over the Karabakh conflict settlement. She also said that the tense internal situation was rather alleviated over two years. “The President made a huge contribution to it, as he discusses the most important issues not only in Armenia, but also in the Diaspora,” she noted.

Head of the Republican Party parliamentary group Galust Sahakyan said that during Serzh Sargsyan's presidency Armenia's positions have significantly strengthened in the foreign political sphere. “Recently, issues related to Armenia were always discussed at major international forums. In other words, the international community already understands Armenia’s problems,” he stressed.

*

Friday, April 9 Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan said that Armenia has almost adopted its resolution on the Armenian-Turkish Protocols. The Armenian side will submit its resolution for public discussion, as soon as it is confident in its correctness, Mr. Sargsyan told journalists in Tavush region. “In this case, it is very important to adopt a correct decision, but it is too early to discuss it,” the President said.

At the same time, he refrained from commenting on the upcoming visit to Washington to participate in global nuclear security summit.

“In terms of destination one-upmanship, little can beat Nagorno Karabakh. Border skirmishes and ongoing wrangling for political control mean it is not for the faint-hearted, but the region has a lot to offer: mountain monasteries, archaeological sites, ancient cave settlements and areas of outstanding natural beauty.

You can fly to Yerevan, via Kiev or Vienna, from around £225, but the British embassy can’t provide assistance in Nagorno Karabakh, so think carefully about travelling independently,” the daily reports.

The attempts of the Armenians to operate flights prohibited in this territory will be prevented anyway. We control all processes and are ready for preventive actions at any moment. It can be done by any means, and the enemy is aware of it. The international conventions Azerbaijan has joined allow it to take actions with regard to attempts to violate the internationally recognized airspace. In fact, there is legal framework for Azerbaijan to justify its moves,” the unnamed officer declared.

It is no secret that Baku has trouble with the legal framework. A question arises - can there possibly be any international legislation that authorizes shoot-down of the civilian aircraft? There has been a similar incident once: on September 1, 1983 the Soviet interceptor SU-15 shot down Boeing 747 of Korean AirLines. All 246 passengers and 23 members of the crew of the Korean civilian airliner were killed. USSR was finally declared the “Empire of Evil” and collapsed 8 years later…

A lie repeated a hundred of times ceases to be one; it now serves another purpose, namely, it misleads both their own army and the people. It is widely known that Azerbaijan is eager to launch hostilities against Nagorno Karabakh, and Armenia in general. Russian political scientist Alexander Skakov openly states that Baku has already taken a decision to start the war; the date just needs to be confirmed. If Baku starts the war, the hostilities will most likely be launched towards the presidential vote scheduled for fall 2013 in Azerbaijan. Despite the loud and delightful statements, Ilham Aliyev will again have to forge the results of the elections; then rallies and arrests will come, following the scenario of 2008. If one takes into account that the Aliyev clan is facing increasingly deteriorating attitude by the international community, Aliyev’s future appears quite gloomy. And here is the moment they would need a small triumphant war. No matter the war turns out to be neither a small nor a triumphant one; the important thing is to launch hostilities, and flights from Stepanakert to Yerevan may really trigger this.

Here the beginning of the World War II can be reminded. The parallel is not a commensurable one, and still… On September 1, 1939 at about 10a.m. Hitler got up on the rostrum and declared that Poland’s regular army had broken into the territory of Germany and started firing. Since 5:45 a.m., German soldiers have been firing and shelling in response. Later they claimed that the war was triggered by the attack of Polish guerillas against Gleiwitz radio station near the Polish border. Anti-German slogans were allegedly being shouted, and a German technician was reported to be killed during the incident. Later the attack appeared to be a staged one.

A graduate of Moscow State Institute of International Relations is apparently aware of all this, and he should have known the outcome of the World War II as well. In this case, Germany will be replaced by Azerbaijan, and Baku’s strategists must always bear this in mind. Turkey may lend a helping hand to Azerbaijan, or the Islamic solidarity might work here. However, nobody is going to carry the war for Ilham Aliyev; the dismal experience of the national-liberation fight in Karabakh in early 90s obviously made various mercenaries reluctant to do it again. Much can be purchased for money, but the skill for warfare is not the thing Aliyev can buy. Even though the Turkish military are far more educated than the Azerbaijanis, NATO specialists will deal with ЗРК Patriot. Hence Baku should consider its actions before ordering to shoot down civilian aircraft.

""The Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group (Ambassadors Robert Bradtke of the United States, Igor Popov of the Russian Federation, and Jacques Faure of France) are deeply concerned by recent reports of a series of ceasefire violations along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border and the Line of Contact that resulted in a number of deaths and casualties.

They are also checking the area in between Azerbaijan and Armenia and meeting with officials.,"Monday is a hard day. For mission members it was especially hard because they decided to start the monitoring program from Karvachar (Kelbadjar) - the most complicated region both in terms of relief and climate and in terms of efforts. There was a lot of snow in the mountains and the traffic on the roads was tied up. Nevertheless the members of the mission visited all the settlements, two villages and the regional center of Karvarchar. In contrast to other regions they met people here. It has never been a secret that in Karvarchar there are little settlements that are mainly inhabited by homeless refugees from Azerbaijan. They have come from the occupied Northern Karabakh fully inhabited by Azeris and seized Armenian villages of Mardakert and Martuni regions. The mission members met those people and were shown enough documents confirming the origin of the inhabitants. 

Tuesday was much easier for the mission. Early in the morning the delegation headed for Fizouli. In the evening they already had to be in Djebrail. Apparently, the mission members had nothing to do in Fizouli where the borderline between Armenian and Azerbaijan forces is located. There is nothing interesting there except military installations and frontier posts. At first, the trip to Fizouli seemed meaningless even to the Azerbaijani who claimed that there were no settlings there. But then for some reason they insisted on including the region in the monitoring program. It should be noted that the army of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic controls not the whole region but only its western parts. It was quite enough to ensure the security of Armenian villages of Martuni region. Karabakh forces did not go further to gain the rear of the enemy in 1993 since they had a concrete aim - to create a security zone. 

In Djebrail which is next to Fizouli there were no organized settlings too. Apparently the mission members were aware of that since they had planned to visit the two regions in one day. It should be reminded that it was planned to spend one whole day in each region. The ""saved"" day will be devoted to Lachin where there are several Armenian villages. It is Lachin that connects Karabakh with Armenia. Up to now in all the discussed project of conflict resolution this region was given a special status to provide Stepanakert with mechanisms of formal and informal control over that strategic territory. Taking into account the circumstances it seems quite natural that in Lachin there is a certain formed infrastructure. 

The experts intend to spend Wednesday in Zangelan which is located to the south west of Nagorno-Karabakh at the border between Iran and Armenia. Later on in the program are Lachin and Aghdam. At the end of the monitoring the mission members will head for Stepanakert where they will again meet the President of the Republic. Then they will fly to Yerevan and after meeting Armenian state authorities they will go to Vienna where the OSCE Headquarters is situated. During a month the experts will prepare a report on their trip. The state authorities of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh jointly with OSCE office have created all the necessary conditions for the mission members. They have at their disposal reliable vehicles, security and translators. They are provided with food, accommodation, communication means and a copier. The experts are accompanied by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nagorno-Karabakh Masis Mailyan who sees that nothing hinders the mission. Official Stepanakert is interested in the efficiency of this mission. Yet two years ago the President of Nagorno-Karabakh applied to the European Council and OSCE and called them to send on a mission a special monitoring group and to check the situation on the spot. It was when Azerbaijan accused Karabakh authorities of burial of nuclear wastes in the security zones, drug traffic and creation of a laboratory for producing chemical and bacteriological weapons. In PACE it was even decided to send a special mission to the regions controlled by Karabakh but it was never done. Conducting of inspections is in the interests of Karabakh. The more thoroughly and objective the monitoring is conducted the easier it will be for Karabakh authorities to disprove the dirty insinuations of Azerbaijan.

""Their historic animosity since the slaughter and mass deportation of Armenians from the collapsing Ottoman Empire in 1915 has destabilized the region, poisoned internal politics, isolated and impoverished Armenia, and cast a shadow over Turkey's relations with Europe and America. Now there is a chance of beginning to heal the wounds.



Yet first a word of caution. Last week's declaration gave no clues to the precise terms of the agreement, nor a timetable. It seems to have been rushed out to enable Barack Obama, US president, to issue a statement commemorating the 1915 massacres without using the word ""genocide"" to describe them. That marked a sensible retreat from his election campaign position in order not to alienate Turkey.



The prize of Turkish-Armenian reconciliation is worth it, but the process remains fragile and bedeviled by mistrust. Both sides are still only inching forward, and both face strong resistance at home to making any concessions at all.



On two vital points, however, there is still no clarity. A historical commission is to be set up to investigate the events of 1915. How will it be constituted and how will it work? If it decides that the massacres did amount to genocide, or did not, it will still be politically explosive unless there is agreement to abide by its results. Second, what progress needs to be made on resolving the Karabakh dispute for Turkey to reopen the border fully?



There seems to be a serious intent in both Ankara and Yerevan to find a way forward in spite of opposition, including from the influential Armenian diaspora in the US and European Union. But pressure on them both from Washington, Brussels and - most significantly - from Moscow for more progress and a clear timetable is still essential.

South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported on Tuesday, August 16 that a high-profile diplomat in the UK defected with his wife and son to a ""third country"". The BBC named the defector as veteran diplomat Thae Yong Ho, a counselor at the North Korean embassy and deputy to the ambassador.

Quoting an unnamed source, JoongAng Ilbo said the diplomat embarked on a defection journey ""following a scrupulous plan"" and was in the process of ""landing in a third country as an asylum seeker.""

It was not clear from the newspaper report whether the third country was the UK. The term is usually used in South Korean media to refer to a country which is neither North nor South Korea.

An official at the North Korean embassy in London would not confirm the defection, describing reports of the event as ""quite sudden"".

""If it is appropriate to give a response, then you might hear about our response,"" the official told Reuters.

Further calls to the embassy went unanswered. Calls to Thae's mobile phone were redirected to a voicemail inbox.

Thae's reported defection follows a string of recent such flights by North Koreans, including twelve waitresses at a North Korean restaurant in China who defected to South Korea earlier this year.

Those waitresses have finished a prolonged period of investigation and will soon enter into normal society, an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry said on Wednesday.

The number of defections by North Koreans to the South has totaled 814 up to and including July this year, an annual increase of 15 percent, a Unification Ministry official told Reuters.

""Azerbaijan’s television broadcasts and official videos on Nakhichevan’s military preparedness have shed more light on developments in the exclave.

Even without Nakhichevan entering a future conflict, the exclave will play a major role in a future war by potentially diverting Armenian troops from the Karabagh front, a tactic that would favour Azerbaijan, the article says.



""An exclave that previously had no role in any possible future hostilities is now becoming part of the extended battlefield. While the major powers have used a soft approach to contain the battle space to Nagorno-Karabakh, the military build-up in Nakhichevan has apparently broken this unspoken understanding,"" it says.

""Theoretically, the exclave’s potential role in a renewed conflict could tip the balance in Azerbaijan’s favour. However, this potential advantage needs to be weighed against the isolation of the exclave, which provides Armenia with an advantage.

A change has also been noted in Azerbaijan’s policy towards Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to a shift away from the negotiation process towards settling the conflict through military means. Azerbaijan’s attack on regions within Nagorno Karabakh itself (which fall under self-determination clauses) in the 4-day war has left many wondering why the superpowers, especially Russia, allowed Azerbaijan to attack regions other than the disputed territories (which are marked for return under the principles written for a negotiated settlement).""

In accordance with the agreement with the co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group, it was planned to establish direct telephone communication between the frontier regions of Armenia and Azerbaijan for a quicker settlement of mutually beneficial tasks, declared the Prime Minister of Armenia Andranik Margarian at the meeting with the head of the OSCE Yerevan office, Ambassador Roy Reeve.

As was reported to MEDIAMAX in the press service of the government of Armenia, Margarian said that up to now Azerbaijan avoids carrying out this agreement. Ambassador Reeve promised to assist in this matter through cooperation with the OSCE office in Baku, which has recently opened.

While discussing the perspectives of cooperation, Prime Minister Margarian suggested the OSCE mission in Armenia assist in the solution of the question of safe joint use of the Johazi storage pool in Tavush region border by the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. Margarian noted that the settlement of this problem is vital for the villages located near the storage pool.

The OSCE office in Yerevan deals with large programs in the sphere of human rights and democracy, as well as works out and realizes anti-corruption programs, said Ambassador Reeve. An international anti-corruption working group is set up. Ambassador Reeve suggested establishing a joint working group with the Government of Armenia. In his opinion, this will considerably raise the rating of Armenia in the world community and will allow applying the Armenian experience of struggle against corruption in other countries.

Mr. Reeve welcomed the plans of the Government of Armenia to create an anti-corruption program and noted that the bill ""About civil service"", worked out by the government, is one of concrete steps in this direction.

Premier Margarian considered acceptable the proposal of the OSCE and on behalf of the government expressed readiness for cooperation in the matter of joint working out and realization of the program for the struggle against corruption. -0-",Yes,Public,Positive,"public goods,conflict dynamics",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Syrian journalists who were taken on a state-organized tour of government-held areas around Yabroud on Tuesday heard gunfire and saw jets flying overhead as troops fought on the edges of the town.

The offensive is part of a military campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah militants, to drive rebels from the border region and secure territory linking Assad's coastal bastions with Damascus.

They may include Ani.,"Work is continuing at the ancient ruins of Ani, a 5,000-year-old Armenian city located in present-day Turkey near the Armenian border in the eastern province of Kars, with an eye on including the site on UNESCO’s World Heritage List, according to Asbarez.

Located some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the city of Kars, another historic Armenian city, Ani is today one of major tourist attractions in Turkey.

Local Culture and Tourism Director Hakan Doğanay said salvage excavations in Ani will be headed this year by Pamukkale University Classical Archaeology Department Professor Fahriye Bayram.

Doğanay said projects regarding the restoration of the ancient city’s walls have now been finished, with the aim of putting Ani on the UNESCO’s heritage list.

“[Ani] may enter the UNESCO list during the meeting to be held in Oslo in 2016. We predict that 2015-2016 will be the years of Kars and the ancient ruins of Ani. The Culture and Tourism Ministry has provided us with great support on this issue,” Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.

“We will also bring over 21 new artifacts from various cultures, making the best use of cultural heritage in our region,” Doğanay added. “Ani is a treasure for us that should be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.”

Ani, which occupies 78 hectares of land and is surrounded by 4,500-meter-long ramparts, was once the capital of a medieval Armenian kingdom that covered much of present-day Armenia and eastern Turkey.

Ani is protected on its eastern side by a ravine formed by the Akhurian River and on its western side by the Bostanlar or Tzaghkotzadzor Balley. The Akhurian is a branch of the Aras River and forms part of the current border between Turkey and Armenia.

Dubbed the “City of 1,001 Churches,” Ani stood on various trade routes, and its many religious buildings, palaces, and fortifications were among the most technically and artistically advanced structures in the world at the time, according to specialists.

The intensive raids and bombing strikes mainly pounded the southern part of Deraa, strategically located on the border with Jordan and where the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad erupted six years ago.

The Syrian army has recently intensified dropping barrel bombs, drums or cylinders packed with shrapnel, and has fired hundreds of so-called elephant rockets on Deraa's old quarter and a former refugee camp nearby, rebels and residents said.

The army has not commented on its troop build-up in Deraa or the escalating aerial bombing. State media has long branded the rebels as foreign-backed ""terrorists"".

More reinforcements from the army and its allies, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and Shi'ite Muslim Iraqi militias, are also being rushed to the city from several locations near the capital, Damascus.

Troops were using the Damascus-Deraa highway, a major supply route where well-fortified trenches on both sides of the road have made it more difficult for rebels to mount attacks.

""The regime has brought large columns of troops from the elite 4th Armoured Division, and also Hezbollah forces,"" said Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman of the so-called Southern Front grouping of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, who are supported by an Arab-Western coalition.

The troops being sent as reinforcements are considered to be the Syrian army's elite division, which has the best training and equipment.

Rebels say the troop build-up and relentless aerial bombing in recent weeks pointed to a major campaign for what the FSA rebels see as a decisive battle.

""Everything indicates the regime is preparing for a large-scale military campaign in Deraa in which they plan to encircle the city and reach the Jordanian border,"" Rayes said.

Adham al-Karad, the commander of the missile brigade in the FSA's Southern Front, said: ""Our surveillance shows troop carriers and heavy armor ... if it continues at this same level of reinforcements, this will be very large.""

The army had stepped up its campaign to regain the Manshiya neighborhood, a strategic district that almost completely fell into rebel hands after four months of street battles.

Rebels stormed Manshiya, the last army foothold in Deraa's rebel-held old quarter, in February to ward off any army attempt to capture a strategic crossing with Jordan.

The army's control of the crossing, a once-thriving passenger and commercial gateway with Jordan, would sever the rebel link between the eastern and western parts of the province they control, dealing a major blow to their cause in the south.

“The projection for an economic recovery in the second half of the year is at the moment still subject to risks,” Bank of Greece’s Governor Yannis Stournaras told lawmakers during a parliamentary committee meeting.

He said that 2016 can be the “beginning of a new path” for the country’s economy. “But in order for that to happen, the review needs to be completed, which has already been delayed,” Stournaras said.

“The mistakes of the past that led to a dead-end must be avoided. Every time there is a failure to conclude the review, sentiment gets worse,” he added, according to the Journal.

Greece’s government is currently locked in negotiations with the country’s international creditors to complete the first review of the country’s third bailout, worth up to €86 billion ($93 billion).

The government is eager for a swift conclusion in order to start negotiations with lenders over the country’s debt relief.

The central bank’s governor said that Greece should follow the example of other countries which have entered bailout programs after Greece and have already completed it, such as neighboring Cyprus or Ireland.

Stournaras also warned about risks ahead for the Greece’s economy that stem from the refugee crisis.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive, said that Greece isn’t properly fingerprinting incoming migrants and has begun proceedings to potentially suspend Greece from the EU’s open-border Schengen zone.

“Possible restrictions on the movement of people and products cannot be excluded,” Stournaras said. “If this happens, it will have major impacts on the country’s economy.”

Greece is the main gateway to Europe for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries, as well as large numbers of other migrants from Asia and Africa, who set off from Turkey.

About 857,000 refugees and other migrants entered the EU via Greece in 2015, risking a dangerous sea crossing that has led to almost daily drownings. Another 68,000 people have landed in Greece so far in 2016.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Israel fears Islamist militants, possibly linked to al Qaeda, have gained a foothold in the Sinai border area since the overthrow last year of President Hosni Mubarak.

Israeli officials have privately voiced concern about heavy military equipment being sent to Sinai, which is subject to restrictions on the deployment of weapons under the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.

Colonel Ahmed Mohamed Mohamed Ali told a news conference in Cairo that 32 ""criminal elements"" were killed and 38 suspects arrested, including non-Egyptians, during the operation which began on August 7.

""Egypt is coordinating with the Israeli side over the presence of Egyptian armed forces in Sinai. They know this. The deployment of the armed forces on all the territory of Sinai is not a violation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel,"" he said.

The sweep began after militants killed 16 border guards on August 5 in the worst attack since Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.

Hundreds of troops with tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters were sent to Sinai in a joint operation with police to raid militant hideouts, arrest suspects and seize weapons.

The Egyptian military is replacing some of its heavy tanks in Sinai with light armored vehicles, security sources said this week.

But Ali rejected the idea that Egypt was pulling out its heavy equipment in response to pressure from Israel. He said the operation was entering a new phase that required different equipment.

Some 31 tunnels used to smuggle goods into the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip were also destroyed, he said. The tunnel trade is central to Gaza's economy which has suffered under an Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory imposed in 2006.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 As well as its defensive role in the Gulf, it will be expected to perform reconnaissance missions reporting back to the coalition headquarters for air strikes against IS.
 
 And, if HMS Defender’s record is anything to go by, it will play a part in protecting some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes from pirates and smugglers. In June, Defender made headlines when it intercepted more than a ton of hash (estimated street value £5.6m) being trafficked across the Indian Ocean.
 
 HMS Daring, which has a crew of 190, has had a troubled past with technical issues. Built by BAE Systems, it broke down in the mid-Atlantic in 2010 and again in Bahrain in 2012.
 
 The Royal Navy has since admitted that the Type 45 destroyers’ innovative gas turbine engines, which are supposed to provide propulsion and electricity for on-board systems at the same time, are prone to breaking down in warm conditions.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many events for all age-groups organized for this event.","Yerevan is celebrating its 2798th birthday on Saturday, October 8.
 
 The capital and largest city of Armenia, Yerevan is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Its history dates back to 782 BC, when the fortress of Erebuni was founded by king Argishti I. A cuneiform inscription proves that the Urartian military fortress was built at the site of modern-day Yerevan.
 
 The cuneiform inscription reads: “By the greatness of the God Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold and proclaimed it Erebuni for the glory of Biainili [Urartu] and to instill fear among the king's enemies. Argishti says, “The land was a desert, before the great works I accomplished upon it. By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, is a mighty king, king of Biainili, and ruler of Tushpa.”
 
 The city is 29 years older than Rome, is the same age as Babylon and the Assyrian city of Nineveh, but unlike the latter, has become a prosperous city now.
 
 The city’s birthday has been celebrated since 1968, when the Erebuni-Yerevan events were organized for the very first time. This year, Armenia’s capital turns 2798, and its birthday is being celebrated under the motto “Yerevan: A City of Sun”.

The app allows Echo Look owners to view live previews from the Look's camera, take a picture survey their outfits, mark favorites, compare styles and more.","Amazon’s odd foray into the world of selfie cameras via the Echo Look is now complete with the launch of a companion application for iOS and Android devices that works with the new connected camera. The app allows Echo Look owners to view live previews from the Look’s camera, take a picture, survey their outfits, mark favorites, compare styles and more, TechCrunch reports.
 
 The company had already detailed how the Echo Look app would work, but the app only rolled out to the various app stores over the weekend – a little under a month after Amazon’s announcement of the Echo Look device itself.
 
 The app is designed to work alongside the Look – Amazon’s funky $200 camera that takes full-length photos and short videos of users via a depth-sensing camera, complemented by built-in LED lighting and computer vision-based background blur. The Look also doubles as a standard Alexa device that can read the news and play audiobooks, give weather forecasts, play music, launch apps, set timers, and more.
 
 The new app also includes support for Style Check, a new service from Amazon that uses a combination of machine learning and advice from human fashion specialists to help you figure out what to wear. The company had actually launched this feature ahead of the Echo Look, via an “Outfit Compare” option on Amazon.com and in its main mobile app.
 
 The Echo Look app includes that feature along with other tools to view and favorite your outfits – allowing you to create a personal lookbook you can access at any time. By encouraging users to save their photos in the app instead of discarding them, Amazon then gains access to real-world data about what’s in consumers’ closets, and what they like to wear.
 
 This will help to better inform the company’s fashion ambitions, which have so far included its own private label brands, some of which are exclusive to Prime, and even an interesting patent for on-demand clothes hinting at future fast-fashion plans.
 
 Not only would the Look know about upcoming trends and popular styles, it could potentially grow to one day include other features – like the ability to take measurements and figure out user’s sizes, or make recommendations about how to accessorize outfits via purchases from Amazon’s site.
 
 For now, however, the first step is getting the camera and app into consumers’ hands, and start pushing them to snap photos and save the results.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ""As a filmmaker raised in Nagorno Karabakh I have listened to stories of hardships endured by my family and villagers, and of their struggles into dealing with such a devastating inter-ethnic conflict.” So says Jivan Avetisyan, a prolific 35 year-old Armenian director with a solid documentary background, who was born in this mountainous landlocked region in the Southwestern tip of Armenia bordering with Azerbaijan. He even had to do his mandatory military service there, in the province’s Defense Army from 1999 to 2001.
 
 It is not surprising that he decided to make it the setting of ""The Last Inhabitant,"" his eighth feature film, which centers around Abgar, the only Armenian of Christian faith left in the village of Gyurjevan, now devastated and in near ruins, after everyone else has been deported. Because of his skills as a stonemason, he is assigned to help build a mosque by the Azeri occupants. He also has to take care of his daughter Yurga, traumatized after witnessing her husband’s murder. As the situation deteriorates around them with increasing enemy danger and lack of food, they find solace in their memories of an idealized past, when peace and happiness still prevailed. The last resort for those who have not much to hope for. With its often elegiac and poetic approach the film is able to achieve a touching portrait of survival and at the same time humanizing the protagonists and their fate, how tragic it may be.
 
 Another of the movies sent for consideration is ""Earthquake"", which is based on the real events surrounding the disastrous earthquake which struck Armenia in 1988. The terrible earthquake claimed at least 25,000 lives and left about half a million people homeless. For director Sarik Andreasyan it was a very special project, in which he wanted, after almost 30 years, to tell the story not only of death and destruction but also to show the hope and community spirit in the face of the nightmare.
 
 The story is built around a Russian family living in the Armenian city of Leninankan. Anna Berezhnaya (Maria Mironova) with her son Vanya (Daniil Izotov) and daughter Katya (Anastasia Savkina) awaits the return from prison of her husband (Konstantin Lavronenko) who eight years prior was sentenced to prison for the death of two people in a car accident.
 
 ""Hot Country, Cold Winter"" tells about the situation in Armenia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. ""Some of the most suffering people there were the members of intelligentsia, who found themselves without means of existence and no sense of purpose. In his film ""Hot Country, Cold Winter"" Armenian director David Sarafian mixes realism and poetry to explore another dark period in the history of his long-suffering people. But don't expect to get all the answers to the many questions asked by this film.
 
 On the surface it is a story of a man and a woman from artistic circles who are suffering through circumstances of a total winter energy crisis. But in some ways this is merely a pretext to delve deeper into the problem of an artist living through hard times. Their recollections and their imagination are used here to help understand not only the story as such, but to appeal to core human values which are universal.

But first they're finding new homes on Earth and engineers to hone their skills, the Associated Press reports.
 
 The space agency has kept one Valkyrie robot at its birthplace, the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It has loaned three others to universities in Massachusetts and Scotland so professors and students can tinker with the 6-foot-tall, 300-pound humanoids and make them more autonomous.
 
 One of the robots, nicknamed Val, still hasn't quite harmonized its 28 torque-controlled joints and nearly 200 sensors after arriving at a robotics center at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell.
 
 Engineering students let the electricity-powered robot down from a harness and tried to let it walk, only to watch as Val's legs awkwardly lurched and locked into a ballet pose.
 
 ""That doesn't look good,"" said Taskin Padir, a professor at Northeastern University, noting Val's $2 million price tag. Northeastern and UMass-Lowell are partnering on a two-year project to improve the robot's software and test its ability to manipulate tools, climb a ladder and perform high-level tasks.
 
 NASA originally designed Valkyrie several years ago to compete in the disaster-relief robotics contest hosted by the U.S. military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, but now it's looking for outside expertise to craft her into a kind of space mechanic.

 The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities on the artificial islands and is concerned they could be used to restrict free movement through the South China Sea, an important trade route.
 
 Last month, a U.S. Navy warship sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in a so-called freedom of navigation operation, the first such challenge to Beijing's claim to most of the waterway since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.
 
 China has denied U.S. charges that it is militarizing the sea, which also is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.
 
 On Mischief Reef, a very large antennae array is being installed that presumably boosts Beijing's ability to monitor the surroundings, the think tank said, adding that the installation should be of concern to the Philippines due to its proximity to an area claimed by Manila.
 
 A large dome recently was installed on Fiery Cross and another is under construction, indicating a sizeable communications or radar system, AMTI said. Two more domes are being built at Mischief Reef, it said.
 
 A smaller dome has been installed near the missile shelters on Mischief, ""indicating that it could be connected to radars for any missile systems that might be housed there,"" AMTI said.

It’s found in smartphones, tablets, computers, external hard drives, flash drives, and more. Anything that makes it smaller is a boon for numerous devices, which is why SanDisk’s latest announcement is a big deal, Digital Trends says.
 
 The company has taken the wraps off a new 256GB 3D NAND chip with three bits per cell and 48 layers.
 
 Built in Japan through a partnership with Toshiba, the chip is a world first that, for the moment, gives SanDisk an edge over competitors in terms of data density.
 
 It’s important to note, though, that the “world’s first” claim is the consequence of the chip’s layers, not its capacity, Digital Trends says.
 
 Micron and Intel have already announced a 256GB 3D NAND chip, but it had only 32 layers. Increasing the number of layers matters because stacking vertically allows a reduction in horizontal width and breadth, effectively giving the chip a smaller footprint. Further decreasing chip size means SanDisk’s hardware can fit where other solid state chips of similar capacity can’t.
 
 3D NAND (in some cases called V-NAND, short for Vertical NAND) looks to be the future of mass storage solid-state drives. It offers much higher data density, which means SSDs can better compete with the maximum capacity of mechanical disk drives. That’s something not possible with conventional NAND, at least not in a standard 2.5″ or 3.5″ drive footprint. The chips simply took up too much space, Digital Trends says.
 
 That said, 3D NAND is not the only new technology in storage. Intel and Micron recently announced 3D XPoint, an all-new form of storage unrelated to NAND that promises far superior read/write performance and durability. Very few details have been revealed about 3D XPoint, however, and its first incarnations are likely to be pricey.

 ""The prosecutors aren't interested in what individual columnists wrote or said. At this point, the reasoning is that prominent employees of Zaman are likely to have intimate knowledge of the Gulen network and as such could benefit the investigation.""
 
 Critics of President Tayyip Erdogan argue he is using the failed July 15-16 coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and tighten his grip on power. The clampdown has drawn criticism from the European Union, which Turkey aspires to join.
 
 Authorities shut down Zaman in March, part of a crackdown on suspected Gulen supporters. They have sharply accelerated the crackdown since the coup attempt, suspending, detaining or placing under investigation more than 60,000 soldiers, police, teachers, judges, civil servants and others.
 
 Gulen, 75, denies involvement in the abortive coup, in which at least 246 people were killed. An ally-turned-foe of Erdogan, he had built up an extensive network of schools, charities and businesses in Turkey over decades, Reuters says.

 As Digital Spy reveals, according to the leak, the next Xbox features an AMD-made eight-core CPU running at 1.6GHz and built on x64 architecture. This is coupled with 8GB DDR3 RAM and 32MB of faster embedded SRAM.
 
 The 32MB of ESRAM is significant for its transfer speed, a reported 102 GB per second. Working in parallel with the DDR3 RAM, the leak claims a peak memory bandwidth for the GPU of 170 GB per second.
 
 If confirmed, it also marks a change from the current Xbox 360's 10MB of eDRAM, which is built into the system's GPU.

The mission will send a Dragon capsule with multiple tons of supplies and equipment to the International Space Station.","SpaceX has a new date for its next launch – February 18, when it’s hoping to make its first launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at pad LC-39A.
 
 The first launch from the Florida facility was originally set for January 29, and was set to be a mission to deliver a commercial EchoStar satellite into orbit, but that was pushed back to a target of the end of February when SpaceX decided to launch its CRS-10 resupply mission with its Dragon supply ship in mid-February, and now we have an exact window for that LC-39A inaugural flight, TechCrunch reports.
 
 SpaceX’s CRS-10 will send a Dragon capsule with multiple tons of supplies and equipment to the International Space Station, including a new instrument specifically designed to monitor and study the ozone layer from the ISS’ vantage point once it’s mounted to the outside of the orbital facility.
 
 The EchoStar XXIII mission is still set to be SpaceX’s first commercial launch from the new pad, which was actually originally built for NASA’s Apollo program, used as a space shuttle area launch complex repurposed for SpaceX’s use. It’s a big step for SpaceX since adding another launch site could help it better meet its aggressive slate of scheduled launches. Scheduling is always subject to change, but this will definitely be one to watch, and not just because it’s only SpaceX’s second time out since its explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket last September.

 Visual Studio 2015 (VS 2015) is now available for download (and purchase), but Team Foundation Server 2015 — part of Microsoft’s online services for development teams — will remain in its release candidate phase until next month.
 
 As part of today’s announcement, Microsoft also released a couple of new download numbers for various tools in the Visual Studio ecosystem. Visual Studio Community, for example, the much-improved free version of the software for non-enterprise users, has now been downloaded five million times since its launch seven months ago. More than 3.2 million developers have now registered for the Visual Studio Online services. Visual Studio Code, the stand-alone code editor for Windows, Mac and Linux has seen half a million downloads since its launch three months ago. More than half of those downloads came from Mac and Linux users.
 
 As Microsoft’s corporate VP of its Developer Division S. “Soma” Somasegar told TechCrunch, the company’s aim with Visual Studio was to make good on its promise to deliver a tool that allows developers to target all the popular platforms. “When you think about Visual Studio, the core theme is that VS 2015 is a cross-platform tool set,” he said. “Developers have been asking for this and we are delivering it.”
 
 To do this, the Visual Studio team integrated Apache Cordova, for example, so developers can write iOS and Android apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They can also take their C++ language skills and build shared components for their iOS, Android and Windows apps. Thanks to its partnership with Xamarin, developers can also take their .NET apps and target iOS and Android.

Coins of Erivan (Yerevan) minted under Persian rule,10/18/2013,Armenia,N/A,"The history of Armenia coins are very interesting as a result of struggle between various tribes as well as the Ottoman and Persian rule over the land of Armenia. This material was prepared in cooperation with Gevorg Mughalyan, the numismatist of the Central Bank of Armenia.","Under their rule, Armenia was devastated and plundered.
 
 The Jalayirid sultanate lasted about fifty years, until disrupted by Tamerlane's conquests and the revolts of the ""Black Sheep Turks"" or Karakoyunlu Turkmens. After Tamerlane's death in 1405, there was a brief attempt to re-establish the sultanate in southern Iraq and Khuzistan. The Jalayirids were finally eliminated by Karakoyunlus in 1432.
 
 As a result of struggle between Akkoyunlu and Karakoyunlu tribes, some territories of the region had been under their alternate rule. Some coins minted by the Jalayir, Karakoyunlu and Akkoyunlu dynasties are known. The collection of the Central Bank of Armenia includes one silver coin with Arab inscription of Akkoyunlu dynasty minted in Ani. Silver coin of Uzun Hasan from Akkoyunlu dynasty minted in Ani
 
 By the middle of the 15th century, nomadic Ottoman tribes gained power and captured Constantinople, making the Byzantine Empire, which survived for nearly 1000 years, fall. Small silver coins were minted in the territory of Western Armenia at that time.
 
 The Eastern Armenia, meanwhile, came under the rule of Persian conquerors, the dynasties of Safavids, Afsharids, Zands and Qajars. Silver coins 1 Shahi, 2 and 5 Shahi, Abbasi coins as well as copper city Fuluses – were in circulation at that time. Some rulers, especially Shah Hossein from the Safavid dynasty, ordered to mint rectangular coins. These were minted in Erivan (Yerevan), Nakhijevan and Ganja.
 
 Description of coins
 
 The coins of Persian rulers were of the same type: they carried Arab inscriptions. Some showed animals and legends. The coins were minted in huge amounts and were later found buried across Armenia. Iranian rulers issued silver and copper city coins, as each city, including Erivan, minted its own coins. These types of coins featured the images of peacock, camel, monkey and lion, which later became the symbol of the Persian Empire along with the sun (known as Lion and Sun symbol). Persian copper city coins minted in Erivan
 
 Some sources say that Yerevan Brandy Company was built in the vicinity of the Erivan mint that was located in the territory of Sardar palace.
 
 Gold coins were uncharacteristic for that time.
 
 Coins of Ottoman sultans of different value – Akce, Altin, Para, Kurus – minted in Erivan, Erzrum, Ganja as well as in Kars and Van during the later periods.
 
 Description of coins
 
 The coins of the Ottoman sultans featured inscriptions in Turkish. Some of them carry Tughra, an intricate decorative device that served as the imperial monogram of the Ottoman sultans and was the ultimate symbol of their power.
 
 The constant struggle for power and capture of territories gave birth to ‘defector-coins’. When Ottoman sultans seized territories in Transcaucasia, they ordered to mint their own coins, as it happened in Erivan and Ganja. Silver coin of Ottoman sultan Ahmed III minted in Erivan

He discusses his experience as he travels around Armenia tasting the various wines.","Writer and 'professional drinker' Henry Jeffreys recently visited Armenia to rediscover the viticultural riches of the country. In an article published on The Spectator, the author details traditional Armenian winemaking techniques, the ancient practice of making wine in the country and much more.
 
 The article reads:
 
 Every 100 metres or so on the main road to Iran that runs through the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia there is a stall selling tomatoes, watermelons and Coca-Cola. I was with an Italian-Armenian businessman Zorik Gharibian and his wife Yeraz, and they suggested we stop at one. On closer inspection those bottles didn’t contain Coke, it was red wine cunningly packaged to smuggle into the Islamic Republic of Iran. We went into the nearby house and there was the winemaker, Haykaz Karapetyan, cigarette in mouth making that year’s wine in plastic bins. ‘No chemicals,’ he said. This was proper natural wine. It smelt good, like a young Beaujolais with the same floral quality. We then went into his cellar to try some older vintages. The 2015 had a distinct tang of vinegar. The 2012 tasted of old socks.
 
 The Gharibians make wine too and from the same grape, Areni Noir, but it is rather different. Their nearby winery is called Zorah and their red, Karasi, costs about £25 in London shops. They are both diaspora Armenians, Zorik brought up in Italy and Yeraz in London and New York. They wanted to buy a vineyard in Tuscany but following a visit to the mother country in 1998 decided to make wine in Armenia. ‘It was like I’d come home,’ Zorik tells me. In 2000 they came across the region around the town of Areni (after which the variety is named) which turned out to be a viticultural paradise. It’s phylloxera (a pest of commercial grapevines) free – though other parts of Armenia are not; there’s plenty of sunshine but the grapes preserve their acidity. ‘Freshness comes naturally because of altitude,’ Zorik explains.
 
 The landscape with its precipitous cliffs, caves and ancient monasteries would be the perfect setting for a new Indiana Jones film. The arid mountains are peppered with bright spots of cultivation, including Zorah’s main vineyard thanks to a recently constructed irrigation pipe built with money from the World Bank. After they bought the land, experts in Armenia and back in Italy advised them to plant Cabernet Sauvignon. ‘When we said we wanted to do something with local varieties people were laughing at us,’ Zorik says. Italian oenologist Alberto Antonini, though, saw the potential in Areni Noir. After years of experimentation with different Areni clones, they planted the vineyard in 2006.
 
 As well as local varieties, they wanted to use traditional Armenian winemaking techniques including ageing in amphora clay pots (karasi in Armenian). Initially they aged some of the wine in barriques, which impart flavours from the wood, but now they just use amphora and Italian botti (giant wooden barrels that don’t add any flavour). You can taste the results. The recent vintages have a whole new vivacity. Zorah make a special cuvee, called Yeraz (after his wife, the word means dream in Armenian), from an unirrigated abandoned vineyard 1600 metres above sea level and around a 100 years old. It’s a good 45 minute drive up the mountain in a 4×4. Actually vineyard isn’t quite the right world as the Areni vines are basically growing wild amongst boulders and walnut trees. ‘So exciting when we discovered the vineyard. Zorik and Alberto were like kids in a sweet shop,’ Yeraz says.
 
 From the Zorah winery you can see a gaping cave in the cliffside. Here archaeologist Boris Gasparyan has found evidence of winemaking from about 4,000 BC. He showed me around the partially excavated site, it is not open to the public, and pointed out the jars that looked uncannily like Zorik’s amphora. He then pointed to other jars which contained traces of bones and blood probably from human sacrifice. Or a party that got out of hand. Evidence of Armenia’s ancient wine culture is everywhere. There are grape motifs on monasteries, churches and even on Soviet era buildings. I saw wild vines, vitis sylvestris, growing by a river and dotted around the country, by the side of the road, in restaurants and family houses, are amphora like the ones at Zorah winery.
 
 The Gharibians aren’t the only diaspora Armenians involved with the wine business. Vahe Keushguerian, originally from Lebanon with spells making wine in Italy, runs a wine consulting company based in Yerevan called Semina Consulting. They have recently set up a nursery to supply Armenian winemakers with native varieties. But his biggest project, Karas, is based largely on international grapes and despite the name does not use amphora. It was set up by Eduardo Eurnekian, an Argentine-Armenian who made his fortune in airports including Yerevan’s. Superstar French oenologist Michel Rolland is also involved. The 2013 Reserve, made from Petit Verdot, Montepulciano and Tannat, I tried was not one of his finer efforts being grotesquely overripe and over-oaked.
 
 Zorik is fiercely opposed to non-native varieties. On my last night in Armenia I had dinner with the Gharibians, Boris the archaeologist and Marina Dallakyan and Iskuhi Manukyan from Yerevan University who are cataloguing indigenous grapes. They were appalled that someone is planning on planting Chardonnay to make wine for the Russian market. Their hope is that the international success of Zorah will inspire others to capitalise on Armenia’s viticultural riches. It’s a rich country in other ways with ancient monasteries (that anywhere else would be thronged with visitors), great food and fiercely proud friendly people.
 
 After dinner Boris stood up and, glass in hand, made a toast that ended, much to my surprise, with a Robert Burns recitation: ‘My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.’ It reminded me of a line from a short story by William Saroyan about how Armenians carry their country within them and ‘when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia.’ Zorik and Yeraz have done just this with Zorah. It could be the start of viticultural revival or, as Zorik says cheerfully, ‘it could all disappear tomorrow.’ It is Armenia after all.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 China is the world's largest mobile market and already Apple's second-biggest market overall, but its growth there is clouded by issues ranging from a contested iPad trademark to treatment of local labor.
 
 Picture handouts dated March 28 and e-mailed to Reuters show Cook seen smiling and meeting workers in the newly built Foxconn Zhengzhou Technology Park in the central province of Henan. The facility employs 120,000 people, the handouts said.
 
 Foxconn is a major part of Apple's global supply chain, assembling most of its iPhones and iPads, but has been hit by a string of worker suicides in recent years that activist groups blame on tough working conditions.
 
 The group is the Taiwan parent of Hong Kong-listed Foxconn International Holdings and Taiwan-listed Hon Hai Precision.
 
 Cook took the reins at Apple in August after the death of the firm's visionary founder, Steve Jobs. His closely guarded itinerary has included talks with Vice Premier Li Keqiang, Beijing's mayor and a visit to one of Apple's two stores in the capital.
 
 On Wednesday, state media reported that China's vice premier promised Cook the country would boost intellectual property protection.

 The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
 
 Apple shipped its first watch in April 2015, hoping for a new blockbuster product amid slowing iPhone sales, which contribute almost 60 percent of revenue. While the company shipped 1.6 million watches from April to June, that was less than half as many as during the same period in 2015, according to IDC.
 
 With investors expecting a revenue decline this fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is banking on a slew of new gadgets, including a new iPhone with a faster chip and improved cameras, and a slimmer MacBook Pro laptop, to reignite growth in 2017.
 
 Ever since its inception, network carriers have been urging Apple to release a version of the watch that can connect to data networks independent of the iPhone, and the Cupertino, California-based company had been working to untether it from the handset, one of the people said. As it is now the watch must be synced with an iPhone to download most types of content and consistently track location.
 
 During the discussions, Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation, according to the people. Apple warned that, even on an aggressive schedule, the earliest possible shipment time-frame for cellular models would have been this December, one of the people said.

 Clotheslines, satellite dishes and tangled cables have sprouted on the deteriorating facades of the buildings, constructed nearly a century ago under French rule.
 
 What was once a feted blend of Moroccan and European architecture is falling apart under the weight of an expanding urban population and neglect.
 
 The city ""was once at the forefront of world architecture,"" architect Rachid Andaloussi says.
 
 But today its early 20th-century residential buildings have been ""abandoned by landlords tired of seeing them deteriorate"", says Andaloussi, the head of Casamemoire, an association to protect the city's architectural heritage. And a housing crisis in the traffic-clogged economic hub has led Moroccans with nowhere else to live to cobble together makeshift homes on rooftop terraces.
 
 ""They've squatted in public infrastructure, factories -- and now they've moved on to the terraces,"" Andaloussi says.
 
 Building themselves shelter from corrugated iron, bits of wood and plastic bags, they have come to occupy what were once emblematic architectural spaces.
 
 Casablanca, known by the Spanish translation of its Arabic name Dar al-Bayda (""White House""), greatly expanded under the French protectorate from 1912.
 
 French architect and urban planner Henri Prost presented his first plan for the Moroccan city in 1915. In the 1920s and 1930s, Prost and mostly fellow French architects built the city that has become the country's economic heart.
 
 They created the city's unique style by blending traditional Moroccan elements like mosaics, stucco and sculpted cedar wood with the European trends of Art Deco and Art Nouveau.
 
 Their work includes the Lincoln Hotel, an Arabesque Art Deco building that was built in 1916 and used by American spies during World War II. But it closed in 1989 and today stands largely in ruins.
 
 The Liberty Building, also called ""The 17th Floor"", was North Africa's first skyscraper when it was built between 1949 and 1951.
 
 And the Wilaya, a former town hall, is an example of the mixed architecture typical of many administrative buildings under the French protectorate.
 
 Architect Driss Kettani says the Casablanca city centre was once a ""feat of architecture and urban planning"", ""with its wealth of neo-Moorish, Art Deco and Modernist architecture"".

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/207114/,"Fotomuseum Winterthur rolls out new visual identity, website",02/29/2016,"Winterthur, Switzerland",N/A,"Fotomuseum Winterthur launched a new visual identity with new infrastructure and design changes that bring the museum's communications systems up to date, offering a new creative identity.","Fotomuseum Winterthur launched a new visual identity, including the redesign of its website and the building of an innovative digital asset management system, Art Daily reveals.
 
 A year in the planning these infrastructure and design changes bring the museum’s communications systems up to date, offering a new creative identity adequate to the very latest developments in photography. Fotomuseum is now better able to communicate its rich content to audiences in Switzerland and abroad, store and retrieve its substantial digital assets, and make efficiencies in its workflow.
 
 Photography is changing rapidly, extending its capacities in relation to computational technologies, data processing and the power of the network. No longer defined by the relative singularity of the chemical image, digital photography increasingly mixes still and moving forms, is subject to instantaneous transformation and is augmented by vast and unpredictable replication. In the algorithmic age photographic imagery is extensively distributed and shaped by incessant change. Connections and interactions between different aspects of the system become more significant.
 
 Fotomuseum has decided to respond decisively to these changes by creating a new visual identity adequate to an extended notion of the photographic. In late 2014 it began a process of renewal, changing its programme and work regimes in relation to the latest developments in creative practice, theory and institutional positioning. In early 2015 it appointed a Digital Curator who joined the museum from Hong Kong. Three months later, in April 2015, it launched SITUATIONS, a new programme format designed to explore the latest manifestations of the photographic. And from the middle of the year, with the support of the Zurich company, Laksila Associates, Fotomuseum began a bidding process to select a design team to take the renewal process forward.
 
 Working with the Rotterdam designer, Simon Davies, Fotomuseum’s curatorial team has formulated an identity that challenges the previously static conception of both photography and the institution, moving decisively beyond its well-established analogue associations. At the same time, the Directors wanted to respect the historical legacy of Fotomuseum and its situation in Winterthur, developing a relatively simple logotype that nonetheless expresses a semantic instability in relation to previously fixed institutional and medium identities. An idea was generated creating an interstice, or gap, between the words ‘Foto’ and ‘Museum’, expressing both the historical solidity of Fotomuseum as well as the challenge posed by a photographic aesthetic of derealisation and constant change. Enabling the insertion of a variety of conceptual elements, Foto_museum engages with the relational aspects of contemporary photographic identities. It can be at once monumental and dynamic, compact and extensive, serious and playful.
 
 Museums now comprise vast digital infrastructures and central to the project has been the renovation of Fotomuseum’s old website. Along with Simon Davies, the web engineering firm, Systemantics, was employed and Fotomuseum’s website has been completely redesigned. It now presents the activities of Fotomuseum more clearly with a strong emphasis on the visual content of the museum. Navigation has been simplified to improve user experience, including full mobile accessibility. A variety of social media has been embedded in the site and a video channel launched to archive interviews and presentations conducted at the museum. Fotomuseum has amassed significant content over the years and this can now be accessed through a search function that aggregates results across the whole website. More content from Fotomuseum’s history as well as a tagging system will be added over the next six months or so. The final result is a website that is packed full of information, easier to use and more visually engaging for online visitors.
 
 Fotomuseum’s digital content has been managed up until now by multiple IT platforms. Like internet technologies, these platforms are constantly evolving, but they have also created isolated silos of information requiring complex integration if data is to be shared and sustained. Fotomuseum has taken the radical step of moving beyond specific IT products for functions such as the online collection, blogs and the publication archive, and has built a unified, fully-linked and sustainable digital asset management system (DAMS). Collaboration with a research consortium, Data Futures, based at the University of Westminster in London, enabled automated transformation of data from multiple existing IT systems into a single corpus which now provides access to Fotomuseum’s many assets for the new website. Data Futures’ open source freizo migration software ensures the sustainability of the Fotomuseum DAMS over many decades. It has built a future-proof foundation for new services such as metadata harvesting for other institutions or interfaces for scholarly research.
 
 Finally, Fotomuseum has also renovated its analogue communications media, providing a new design for posters, invitation cards and other printed matter. These media have been rationalised and present the possibility of project-specific design that also enables the playful and challenging aspects of the Foto_museum logotype.
 
 Duncan Forbes, Fotomuseum Director, said: We are very proud of this transformation and believe we’ve designed an identity for Fotomuseum which enhances its reputation as a leading venue for photography, as well as being both playful and intellectually challenging. Furthermore, for a mid-sized museum our digital infrastructure is now one of the most advanced in Europe.

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/232371/,"Valve developing three ""full"" VR games",02/11/2017,World,N/A,Valve is the process of developing three VR games meaning Valve is producing three new entertainment experiences for people as it is a realm of virtual experiences.,"Valve is in the process of developing three VR games. And these won't just be small free VR experiments, either, Eurogamer reveals.
 
 ""Right now we're building three VR games,"" Valve founder Gabe Newell confirmed to Eurogamer during a media roundtable at the studio's Bellevue, Washington office.
 
 ""When I say we're building three games, we're building three full games, not experiments,"" he later clarified when asked about Valve's free HTC Vive prototype The Lab.
 
 While Newell wouldn't say anything about the games themselves, he did note that they're being built in both Source 2 and Unity.
 
 ""One of the questions you might be asking is 'Why in the world would you be making hardware?'"" Newell continued. ""What we can do now is we can be designing hardware at the same time that we're designing software.
 
 ""This is something that Miyamoto has always had. He's had the ability to think about what the input device is and design a system while he designs games. Our sense is that this will actually allow us to build much better entertainment experiences for people.""
 
 Newell insisted that VR isn't a gimmick, but rather a completely new language in the realm of virtual experiences. ""It feels like we've been stuck with mouse and keyboard for a reeeaaally long time and that the opportunities to build much more interesting kinds of experiences for gamers were there, we just need to sort of expand what we can do. But it's not about being in hardware, it's about building better games. It's about taking bigger leaps forward with the kinds of games that we can do.""
 
 In other words, Newell believes that VR needs to offer something that cannot be obtained elsewhere. ""VR is not going to be a success at all if people are just taking existing content and putting it into a VR space,"" he said. ""One of the first things we did is we got Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress running in VR, and it was kind of a novelty. That was purely a developer milestone, but there was absolutely nothing compelling about it, the same way nobody's going to buy a VR system so they can watch movies.""
 
 Basically, it doesn't sound like Valve is going to repackage its older titles with some VR implementation at a premium price. Whatever the Half-Life studio is cooking up sounds a lot more ambitious than that, Eurogamer said.
 
 The downside to Valve's ambition is that it is not going to come cheap. Newell isn't interested in what low-end VR can do. He wants to see what the cutting edge kit is capable of. Because in the end, it doesn't matter how affordable VR headsets are if there isn't a strong reason to acquire one.
 
 ""If you took the existing VR systems and made them 80 per cent cheaper there's still not a huge market, right? There's still not an incredibly compelling reason for people to spend 20 hours a day in VR,"" Newell stated. ""Once you've got something, the thing that really causes millions of people to be excited about it, then you start worrying about cost reducing. It's sort of the old joke that premature cost reduction is the root of all evil.""
 
 One of Newell's boldest predictions about VR is that its display tech will improve immeasurably in the next two or so years. ""We're actually going to go from this weird position where VR right now is kind of low-res, to being in a place where VR is actually higher res than just about anything else, with much higher refresh rates than you're going to see on either desktops or phones,"" he prophesied. ""You'll actually see the VR industry sort of leapfrogging pretty much any other display technology in terms of those characteristics. It's probably not obvious from the first generation of products, but you'll start to see that happening like in 2018-2019.""
 
 Despite all this, Newell is humble in his predictions. The Valve founder freely admits that he was completely wrong about the potential of Nintendo's hardware, twice.
 
 ""You can always be surprised, right? Personally, I thought the DS was kind of stupid,"" Newell recalled of his initial impressions. ""It was totally wrong. I thought Sony was going to crush Nintendo in that generation of handheld devices. I hadn't worked on it. I hadn't tried to design any games for it. And clearly the DS ended up being the winner.
 
 ""The flipside was the first time I played Wii Sports (to continue to use Nintendo as an example) I was like 'Oh my god! There's so much opportunity! There's so much potential here that we're all going to go discover!' Then it turned out that Wii Sports had pretty much nailed it and that was it.""
 
 Newell isn't afraid of failure, a philosophy he and his colleagues bring up multiple times throughout the meeting. ""If you're not failing then you're probably not exploring the potential space wide enough. We're sort of optimistic, right? We think VR is going right. It's going in a way that's consistent with our expectations. We're also comfortable with the idea that it may turn out to be a complete failure, simply because if you're not trying to do things that might fail, you're not actually probably trying to do anything very interesting at all.""",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 A spokesman said it was the longest tunnel found to date and was meant for use in attacks on Israeli civilians, according to BBC News.
 
 The military wing of Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, dismissed the find, saying the tunnel was not new. The tunnel is longer than one which Israel announced it had discovered last October which reached 1.7km (1 mile).
 
 Militants have repeatedly tried to penetrate Israel using tunnels under the heavily secured border, managing to use one in a raid which killed two Israeli soldiers and saw a third, Gilad Shalit, kidnapped in 2006.
 
 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not say when or where the latest tunnel was found, but that it had thwarted a potential attack.
 
 ""This advanced tunnel was intended to pose a direct link and threat to Israeli territory, and enable Hamas terrorists to reach and harm Israeli civilians,"" said spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner.
 
 ""Tunnels such as this are built to assist terrorists in the execution of terror attacks. In the past Gaza terrorists have utilised such tunnels to Israel for infiltration, detonation and abduction of Israeli citizens.""
 
 The IDF said it was still investigating the tunnel, which it said ran for hundreds of metres inside Israel and varied in depth.
 
 However Hamas' military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, disputed Israel's claim.
 
 A spokesman noted ""there was no military or intelligence achievement by the enemy"", adding that ""this tunnel is not new. ""It is an old tunnel that Israel exposed two months ago and jihad fighters worked to rebuild it.""",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal with see Volvo sell 100 cars to Uber along with a longer-term project to work together that will incorporate autonomous driving technology.,"Uber and Volvo have entered into an industrial partnership to collaborate on autonomous car development, the two companies announced Thursday, August 18. The deal will see Volvo sell 100 cars to Uber by the end of the year (a few have been delivered already) along with a longer-term project to work together on new vehicles that will incorporate autonomous driving tech, The Verge says.
 
 Initially, Volvo will sell Uber XC90 SUVs prepped for Uber’s autonomous vehicle control package, but not include any of its own advanced self-driving technology. Uber will then outfit the cars with autonomous driving technology it has developed in house.
 
 ""The alliance marks the beginning of what both companies view as a longer term industrial partnership,"" said a Volvo press release. It doesn’t appear that the companies will be collaborating on the autonomous driving technology itself. Instead, Volvo will work on its own autonomous tech apart from Uber, though they will share the underlying vehicle platforms.
 
 A new autonomous vehicle will be built on Volvo’s Scalable Product Architecture, the same platform as its XC90, S90, and V90 cars, and the collaboration between Uber and Volvo will focus on the development of that vehicle. Both companies will use that vehicle for their next stage of autonomous vehicle development, The Verge says.
 
 With Uber beginning public trials of its autonomous car technology, using a mix of Volvo’s XC90 and Ford Fusion sedans, some safety concerns have been raised about rolling out the technology before it’s ready. The PR fallout from the crash of a semi-autonomous Tesla back in May has unsettled many.
 
 ""There has been no demonstration that Uber's robot cars are safe,"" said John Simpson of Consumer Reports. ""It is unconscionable to offer rides to passengers at this stage. We can only hope nobody is hurt in this outrageous PR stunt.""",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's because the satellites are equipped with reconfigurable radios called AppSTAR, which NASA built together with Florida-based Harris Corporation. AppSTARs are capable of transmitting larger amounts of data than NASA's current radio communications network can. Plus, they can be reprogrammed from a distance through software upgrades, allowing the agency to tweak them for future missions, Engadget said.
 
 These new radios will enable flight tracking over oceans, since they were designed to receive signals from new airplane transceivers called ADS-B. The transceivers automatically send out a flight's number, location and other details. Harris systems engineer Jeff Anderson says ""you can keep track of all the aircraft in the world"" within seconds once the radios are operational.
 
 The ability to track all flights will allow planes to fly with less space between them and to take shorter routes to save fuel, since they'll have little risk of colliding mid-air. If anything does go wrong, search rescue operations will now have the plane's exact location.
 
 A SpaceX flight that took off earlier this month ferried the first 10 Iridium Next satellites to orbit, and the company is slated to launch more this year. If everything goes according to plan, the network (and its radios) will be up and running in 2018.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of disciplined user accounts do not commit a second infraction, Twitter said, suggesting it has had success in reshaping some users’ behavior. But Twitter did not share the hard numbers behind its data, and users continue to post accounts of the company appearing to ignore physical threats, The Verge reports.
 
 In a meeting with reporters, Twitter executives laid out the following results of their anti-abuse efforts. The company:
 
 - is taking action against 10 times more accounts this year than it did last year, amounting to “thousands more” every day. has discovered twice as many accounts created by users who were previously banned.
 
 - saw a 25 percent decline in abuse reports linked to accounts that were disciplined by making their tweets visible only to their followers for a period of time.
 
 - found that 65 percent of accounts that were disciplined have not offended a second time.
 
 - saw a 40 percent reduction in blocks received from accounts that recently received mentions from an account that doesn’t follow them. (This suggests that replies from non-followers that contained abuse were never surfaced to the user, thanks to improved muting controls Twitter says.)
 
 Twitter declined to release the raw data behind any of its observations, although it will consider doing so in the future, said Del Harvey, the company’s vice president of trust and safety. (Among other things, Twitter is concerned that releasing the data could subject it to new requests from governments and law enforcement agencies, a spokeswoman said.)
 
 Twitter’s announcements follows a series of product changes designed to reduce abuse, following years of neglect.

 It continues on Turkey-Armenia Relations: ""Ankara doomed the U.S.-backed Turkey-Armenia Protocols from the start by openly manipulating these accords both to ensure continued U.S. complicity in its Armenian Genocide denials and to impose new preconditions on Armenia to satisfy Azerbaijan's demands.
 
 While in Armenia, Secretary Clinton can jump-start prospects for true Armenia-Turkey progress by honoring her own promise to American voters - and the pledge made by President Obama – to properly recognize the Armenian Genocide. Durable peace between these two nations must be built upon truth and justice, not foreign government pressure.
 
 There would be no better place for Secretary Clinton to explicitly offer America's condemnation of this terrible crime, and end years of shameful U.S. complicity in Turkey's denials, than at the Armenian Genocide Memorial in Yerevan. Should the Secretary choose to avoid the Memorial, due to concerns about Turkey's response, she will, sadly, have dug the Obama Administration into an even deeper hole of genocide denial. This is the Administration's chance to reverse its morally bankrupt policy of allowing Turkey to impose its gag rule on American recognition of the Armenian Genocide.""
 
 As to Nagorno Karabakh the statement says: ""Today, a year and a half into this Administration, we remain deeply troubled, that, despite the President's campaign assurances and America's core commitment to democratic self-governance, the President and Secretary continue arm-twisting the Armenian side to accept an unfair and dangerous settlement based on principles that, if they were in force in 1776, would have kept the American colonies within the British Empire.
 
 The Secretary's visit provides a great opportunity to get things right by openly staking out a strong U.S. stand for a Nagorno Karabakh settlement based on the core American principles of democracy and self-governance.""
 
 It concludes with the opinion on U.S.-Armenia Relations: ""Despite the unprecedented flexibility shown by the Armenian Government - on issues ranging from the Protocols and the Karabakh talks to Armenian military deployments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo - we have seen no movement by President Obama, despite his unambiguous promise to the contrary, in terms of honoring his pledge to maintain aid and expand trade with Armenia.""
