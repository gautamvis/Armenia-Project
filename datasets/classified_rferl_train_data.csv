,,https://www.rferl.org/a/HRW_Calls_On_Obama_To_Reverse_Damage_Of_Bush_Years_/1370106.html,HRW Calls On Obama To Reverse Damage Of Bush Years ,"January 14, 2009 16:44 GMT",,,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) has used its annual report to urge the incoming Obama administration to make the protection and defense of human rights the central tenant of its policy decisions on foreign and national affairs.The group says that is the only way to undo what it calls ""the enormous damage of the Bush years.""HRW's London director, Tom Porteous, says President George W. Bush's ""war on terror"" has been waged without regard for human rights, with the result that many governments around the world have turned a similarly blind eye to the issue.""The Bush years have been disastrous for human rights because the United States itself has abandoned human rights in its counterterrorism policies,"" Porteous says. ""And this has sent a message to repressive governments around the world that abuse of human rights is acceptable and carries no serious cost. So we are calling on President-elect [Barack] Obama to reverse that.""Porteous calls the last eight years ""depressing"" for human rights advocates, but says the change of presidential administration is a chance for the United States to regain its global credibility as a leader on rights issues.With that goal, HRW is calling on Obama to send a clear signal that the United States is abandoning abusive tactics in its counterterrorism efforts. Those efforts have included interrogation techniques that use methods considered torture under international law, and maintaining a U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where so-called enemy combatants are held without charge and denied due process. The group is also urging Obama to take a friendlier attitude than Bush did toward the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, possibly even seeking membership on the council and ""re-signing"" the ICC treaty to show that it has rejoined the global rights community.No Longer Human Rights ChampionThe 2009 report also criticizes governments that pay lip service to human rights in order to gain international credibility, but then ignore or abuse their citizens' rights in domestic policies. Porteous cited China and Russia as two governments that work actively at the United Nations to undermine international human rights standards so as to protect oppressors and shield abusers.""These states have all, in different ways, been very active in defending the rights of other states to abuse their people in the name of sovereignty, noninterference, and regional solidarity,"" Porteous says.""And because the United States has not been engaged in any of this diplomacy, and because its credibility on human rights has been undermined by its own abuses, this has really left the European Union as sort of the only serious champion of human rights in the world,"" he adds. ""And the European Union, because some of its own interests, and also because of some of its own internal problems, has really not been up to the task of fulfilling that role effectively.""A united EU-U.S. front on human rights abuse, Human Rights Watch says, would present a formidable challenge to abusive governments.The report cites the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza -- where more than 900 civilians have been killed in fighting between Israel and Hamas -- as underscoring the need for the world to work harder to prevent the human rights abuses that accompany armed conflicts today.That means the United States must be willing to hold its allies accountable for rights violations. ""Above all I think it's important that the Obama administration give a strong indication that it's going to stop turning a blind eye to abuses of its major allies that are being justified in the name of counterterrorism and that would include the abuses of allies in the Middle East, including Israel,"" Porteous says.In Iran, Human Rights Watch says President Mahmud Ahmadinejad continues to use ""national security"" as a reason for crushing dissent. In 2008 there was a dramatic rise in arrests of political activists, academics, journalists, and others for peacefully exercising their rights of free expression and association in Iran, the report says. Iran 's execution of underage offenders has been widely criticized.It also cites numerous reports of the torture and mistreatment of such detainees. The country's judiciary and the Ministry of Intelligence commit most of the country's serious human rights violations, according to the report, which notes that the number of executions increased sharply in 2008. Iranian law allows death sentences for girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15.The report says human rights conditions in Iraq remain extremely poor. More than 2.5 million Iraqis have been displaced by the war and those that remain are frequent targets of attacks by Sunni and Shi'ite armed groups. HRW cites reports of widespread torture and abuse in detention facilities, which are run by Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries. Afghanistan is experiencing its worst violence since the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001, the report says. Widespread human rights abuses, warlordism, and impunity persist. The Taliban has extended its control across parts of the country once considered free and stable.HRW says the government of President Hamid Karzai lacks the will to institute needed reforms and corruption is rampant. In particular, the report criticizes Karzai for not implementing the Action Plan for Peace, Reconciliation, and Justice, which it passed in 2006. Most strikingly, the report says Afghan women and girls rank among the world's worst-off by most indicators, including maternal mortality, life expectancy, and literacy.Tajikistan's human rights problems ""are numerous and chronic"" the rights group says, citing lack of access to justice, due process violations, and ill-treatment in custody. Though Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov has opened the country somewhat, it's still one of the most repressive in the world.It criticizes the government for exercising what it calls ""excessive control over NGOs, religious organizations, political parties, and the media"" and notes that authorities in the capital, Dushanbe, are continuing a policy of forcibly and sometimes violently evicting people living in the city center. These dislocated Tajiks are resettled on the city outskirts, sometimes in unsafe buildings, according to HRW.In the last two years, Turkmenistan's government has begun to reverse the cult of personality that former President Saparmurat Niyazov built around himself, HRW says, citing changes for the better like a new constitution and the abolition of devastating social policies. But while new President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov has ended the country's self-imposed isolation and attracted foreign interest in the country's hydrocarbon resources, Turkmenistan remains one of the most repressive and authoritarian countries, according to the report.Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people languish in Turkmen prisons on convictions on politically-motivated charges. HRW says independent activists and journalists in exile are under constant threat of government reprisal, and no independent organization has been permitted to carry out research on human rights abuses inside the country or gain access to detention facilities.The Uzbek government's human rights record remains abysmal, according to HRW.During 2008, the authorities continued to suppress independent civil-society activism and religious worship, and to deny accountability for the 2005 Andijon massacre. Despite this, international pressure on the Uzbek government has actually declined as a result of the partial lifting of European Union sanctions.Under President Islam Karimov, HRW says the lack of rule of law is a fundamental, structural problem. The judiciary lacks independence and a ""deeply entrenched culture of impunity for abuses persists.""The report says local media outlets are not free and the government refuses to accredit foreign journalists, while also blocking access to many websites offering independent information on Uzbekistan and on topics deemed sensitive by the government. It also says forced child labor in the country's cotton fields remains a key rights concern.The HRW report takes Russia to task for using cluster bombs in areas populated by civilians during its August 2008 war with Georgia, and for failing to protect civilians in areas under its effective control. The report says its investigators found evidence that members of the South Ossetian militia and armed criminal gangs looted and burned homes, and killed, raped, beat, and threatened civilians in these areas. Inside Russia, HRW says, the government of President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has continued to tighten control over civil society through selective implementation of the law on NGOs, restriction and censure of protected expression and the media, and harassment of activists and human rights defenders.In Belarus, sometimes called ""the last dictatorship in Europe,"" HRW says authorities continue to use the criminal justice system to control civil society, political opposition, and the media. The report says in 2008, as in previous years, several opposition activists and journalists were arrested and jailed for participating in unsanctioned protests. Violence was used against some activists and journalists during demonstrations.HRW notes that Belarus released its last remaining political prisoners in 2008, but at least 10 activists continue to serve ""restricted freedom"" sentences that permit them only to be at home or at work. Armenia experienced one of its most serious civil and political rights crises since independence when security forces used excessive force in March 2008 against opposition demonstrators protesting the results of the February presidential election, according to the HRW report. Testimony from local human rights defenders includes reports of torture and ill-treatment in custody. And journalists, particularly those critical of the government, continue to face politically-motivated charges.",,,

Amenia's state gas company, ArmRosGazprom, said that the repair of the Ghazakh-Sagoramo pipeline in Georgia is nearly complete. The pipeline -- which passes through the Azerbaijani-populated Gardabani district of Georgia -- is the key source of gas supplies to Armenia.Georgia suspended the flow of gas on January 9, citing emergency repairs on the key pipeline. Georgian Energy Minister Aleksandre Khetaguri said the pipeline was seriously damaged by increased gas pressure that he said was due to a seasonal rise in consumption in Armenia.",,public,1
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenian_Speaker_Europe_Political_Prisoners/1365251.html,Armenian Speaker Chides Europe Over Political Prisoners ,"December 30, 2008 17:47 GMT",,,"YEREVAN (RFE/RL) -- The speaker of Armenia's parliament, Hovik Abrahamian, has suggested European multilateral organizations are applying a ""double standard"" toward Armenia and some other member states over purported political prisoners. Abrahamian also argued that his country's authorities have been consistent in complying with the demands set by two successive resolutions on Armenia adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in the wake of violence in Yerevan following the February presidential vote and a government crackdown on political opponents protesting the outcome. In an interview this week with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Abrahamian said that, despite PACE's urgings, it would be wrong to declare a general amnesty for more than 100 opposition members and supporters who were arrested and jailed in connection with the deadly March 1 clashes until after their trials are concluded. ""The president [Serzh Sarkisian] has said on many occasions that while a general amnesty is not excluded, it can only happen after the completion of court trials,"" Abrahamian said. ""As for pardons, you know that the president has already responded to three appeals to grant pardons to three citizens."" One of the demands of PACE's April and June resolutions was to release opposition members detained on ""seemingly artificial or politically motivated charges."" On December 17, the PACE Monitoring Committee for the first time described the jailed Armenian oppositionists as ""political prisoners"" and urged the Strasbourg-based body to impose sanctions on Armenia by stripping its eight-member delegation of the voting rights. Abrahamian denies the presence of political prisoners in Armenia until the completion of trials of leading opposition members. The trial of seven opposition figures charged with plotting a coup began in Yerevan earlier this month amid renewed opposition claims that the defendants in the trial, including Armenia's former foreign minister and three members of parliament, are victims of political persecution. ""No one has the right to use the term 'political prisoner.' I think there are no political prisoners in Armenia. And the president of the republic on numerous occasions has said that no one will be condemned for their political views,"" Abrahamian said. ""In general, I don't want the Council of Europe to apply double standards in relation to different countries, since by moving to deprive Armenia of its voting right, which is very unacceptable for us, they will thus show a discriminative approach. If so, Azerbaijan should have been deprived of its voting rights still in 2001, since the presence of political prisoners there was already proved then."" ""There has been only talk of it in Armenia and the presence of political prisoners in Armenia hasn't been grounded yet,"" Abrahamian said. ""I am convinced that it will be correct if the Council of Europe allows time and opportunity for trials to be completed and at that time, after steps taken by the republic's president, we will draw conclusions."" At the same time, Abrahamian said Armenia ""highly values its relations with the Council of Europe and generally with European structures."" ""Of course, we must do everything to prevent the sanctions from becoming a reality,"" he said. ""During the vote [on the PACE Monitoring Committee's recommendation], people will hear the reasons, and I am sure the right decision will be made."" Abrahamian went on to suggest it was ""in the interest of the opposition to have protracted trials"" and urge radical opponents not to obstruct any ongoing legal processes. ""I am convinced that our country's president in general is against having political prisoners and will not allow any citizen to be convicted for his political views,"" Abrahamian added.",,,
,A,https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenian_PM_Defends_Economic_Policies_In_Face_Of_Global_Crisis_/1364811.html,Armenian PM Defends Economic Policies In Face Of Global Crisis ,"December 29, 2008 16:16 GMT",Armenia,Prime minister attempting to boost economy and create jobs through the building of infrastructure,"The Armenian prime minister believes the set of measures foreseen by the government will help Armenia cope with the negative consequences and minimize the impact of the continuing economic crisis in 2009.Tigran Sarkisian said more investments in infrastructure development and several large projects to be launched by the state will provide new jobs for people to offset possible redundancies elsewhere.""We should essentially increase our spending in such directions as infrastructure development, including road and housing construction, rehabilitation efforts in the [1988 Spitak] earthquake area, projects in the energy sector, irrigation and drinking-water-supply systems, which coupled with a drastic increase in lending to small and medium-sized enterprises will create new jobs,"" Sarkisian said in an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service last week.""Besides we also plan to carry out several large projects that will provide essentially help in dealing with the consequences of the crisis,"" he continued. ""These, in particular, include the construction of the north-south highway with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, a program which has regional significance and is due to be carried out jointly with Georgia, as well as the construction of a new nuclear power plant, and the construction of an Iran-Armenia railway. All these programs also imply the creation of new jobs."" Sarkisian also referred to some international evaluations, including those made by Moody's International ratings agency, predicting stability for Armenia in the immediate future.But he added: ""All predictions made in the world today change every week and it is conditioned by the circumstance that the global financial and economic crisis is gathering new momentum and there is no methodology or institution that would be able to make precise predictions as to how long this crisis will last and what impact it will have on developing countries. So, I think it would be more correct if instead of spreading pessimistic sentiments, which by itself creates negative expectations and deepens the crisis, we should speak realistically.""Sarkisian concedes that Armenia is expected to end the year with a tremendous foreign-trade deficit, with imports exceeding exports nearly fourfold.But he cited the example of the United States, which ""in the past 28 years has imported more goods than it exported and by no means is among the world's worst economies."" ""Naturally, Armenia has a very serious problem, that is, structural readjustments are taking place, a new structure of the economy is emerging, and we should be able to understand what the future of our economic system is and what structure our economy should have,"" Sarkisian said.""Many dream of the day when we will have a strong machine-building sector, when we will manufacture and export goods like those in China or India. But I think all realize well it is not a future for us,"" he added. ""Our strategy is to focus on an economy based on labor and intellect rather than materials, which means that we should primarily pay attention to the balance of payments, not the export of commodities, but the export of services, and carrying out economic activities not only in the territory of Armenia, but also in its worldwide diaspora.""The prime minister is hopeful that Armenia will manage to carry out successful reforms required for continued U.S. government aid under the Millennium Challenge Account. ""We have, indeed, made pledges to our own people to make these reforms, also in terms of forming a system of good governance. It is not a secret that we do have numerous difficulties, such as corruption, bribery, an ineffective governance system, low revenues, the presence of more than a hundred thousand socially vulnerable families, and we should overcome these difficulties also due to the Millennium Challenge Account program,"" Sarkisian said. ""We are extremely grateful to our American partners for the technical assistance that they have rendered to the Armenian government so that we can overcome all these existing difficulties,"" he added. ""Therefore, we have developed a clear program, which has also been appreciated by the Millennium Challenge Account office. And the program of these measures has a timetable and people who is in charge of ensuring its proper execution.""Government ReformsSarkisian also rejected allegations by some government critics that in the past several months the central bank has reneged on its adopted ""floating"" policy for currency exchange rates and has sought to keep the national currency from depreciating against major world currencies with financial interventions on the foreign-exchange market.""Our concept that we have developed together with the International Monetary Fund in 1993 implies that Armenia sticks to the so-called ""floating"" exchange rate policy for its national currency, which means that it is formed by the supply and demand existing on the market. We have remained committed to this policy and will stay committed to it in the future. We are not going to make artificial interventions in the formation of the exchange rate because it is fraught with many consequences,"" he emphasized.Sarkisian also spoke in favor of creating equal conditions for competition in the agricultural sector, though he said this would not include protectionism. He also said that beginning next month, large agricultural enterprises will have to pay value-added taxes like enterprises in other sectors do. ""This strategy implies that agriculture, like in any country of the world, should also be taxable,"" he said, noting that the sector has been exempted from all taxes thus far.The prime minister also reiterated the government commitment to fight corruption and stressed the role of the active engagement of civil-society organizations and opposition political parties in the anticorruption measures.""That's why I urged all opposition political parties to have an active participation in our anticorruption program, in particular through monitoring, which is one of the key instruments,"" Sarkisian said, adding that this control will essentially increase public faith in the program and will raise its efficiency. Rejecting RestrictionsResponding to the question about the state of democracy in Armenia in a year that has seen plenty of criticism from various international organizations of how Armenia has been handling its worst-ever internal political crisis, Sarkisian said: ""Freedom of speech, democratic values do not imply that our country should be sliding into chaos. Freedom of speech is not arbitrariness. People should also have a sense of responsibility.""In particular, he responded to opposition claims that the authorities restrict its freedom of assembly by refusing to provide space for its political gatherings.""We provide the government conference hall to organizations on a contractual basis and if so, the rules stipulated by the contract must be respected,"" he said. ""We have added one point to our contract that if an organization fails to observe the rules, then it does not get the conference hall at the second time of asking. This is a democratic approach.... If we do not respect our word ourselves, no one will respect it.""Sarkisian also denied any political implications behind the parliament's decision to suspend the tenders for TV frequencies in view of the mandatory digitalization of broadcasting in the country. Government critics say the move is primarily aimed at preventing A1+, a television station critical of the authorities, from returning to the air after it was controversially pulled off in 2002. Sarkisian said he regrets that the decision to postpone tenders for TV frequencies has become a matter of political speculation. ""All international organizations with which I have dealt with regarding this matter fully accept our reasons. Furthermore, we had no alternative to this decision,"" he said. ""We could not announce a competition for two years because we have an international commitment to achieve digitalization in the broadcasting sphere and time should be given to the private sector to get ready for the tenders in which this transition that we must complete within five years should be considered.""The prime minister also disagrees that financial penalties against Bjni, a leading mineral-water producer, are in any way linked to its owner, pro-opposition lawmaker Khachatur Sukiasian, who has been in hiding since the start of the government crackdown on opposition members who backed to former President Levon Ter-Petrossian in the February presidential election. ""I do not agree that there is any political persecution in this case. But I agree that one must not be persecuted for political views, especially in the economic sphere,"" he said. ""As for Bjni, it is obvious that the company made serious violations, evaded taxes. And I would want you to focus on this issue in the first place. Didn't it in fact evade millions in taxes? It is essential to answer this question and by answering it we will refrain from such political speculations.""The exercise of tax control started a long time ago and it concerned not only Bjni, but also other enterprises, including those working in the same sphere. Such violations were found at many enterprises. But unlike Bjni those enterprises admitted their fault and fulfilled their tax obligations. Meanwhile, Bjni is trying to politicize the matter to avoid fulfillment of obligations that it has toward the state budget, which is inadmissible,"" the prime minister concluded.",,public,1
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Year_In_Review_War_Peace_And_Football_Diplomacy_In_South_Caucasus/1364000.html,2008 In Review War Peace And Football Diplomacy In The South Caucasus ,"December 26, 2008 12:59 GMT",,,"The gloves came off in Georgia. An olive branch came out in Armenia. And the prospect of a peace settlement beckoned in Nagorno-Karabakh.Russia, which had seen its influence in the South Caucasus wane in recent years, roared back with a vengeance to stake a claim in a region that Moscow has long seen as its natural sphere of influence. From the bitter August war between Russia and Georgia to Tbilisi's stalled bid to join NATO to Armenia's surprising overtures to archrival Turkey, 2008 was a year of geopolitical tremors, high-risk maneuvers, and great-power jockeying in the restive South Caucasus.And analysts say this strategically vital region is on the brink of still more turbulence as Russia continues to reassert itself and the uneasy post-Soviet status quo -- with its unsettled ""frozen conflicts"" in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh -- comes unraveled. ""I think what we are seeing is the unfreezing of situations that had existed since the breakup of the Soviet Union or shortly thereafter in the early 1990s,"" says Lawrence Sheets, a Tbilisi-based analyst and Caucasus program director for the International Crisis Group.""You saw that with the increasing frustration among the current Georgian leadership with the situations in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,"" Sheets continues. ""In terms of the situation between Azerbaijan and Armenia, I think we are obviously seeing some sort of movement and that movement is the result of external factors.""'Strategic Normalcy'This was also the year that Western dreams of promoting democracy in the South Caucasus were dealt setbacks across the board.In Armenia, Serzh Sarkisian won the presidency in February in an election that the opposition and international observers claimed was flawed. After the vote, the authorities violently suppressed opposition demonstrations. Approximately one thousand people were arrested and 10 were killed in the immediate postelection violence. Some 67 opposition figures remain in custody.Elections in Azerbaijan were not seen as free or fair.The authoritarian regime of President Ilham Aliyev in energy-rich Azerbaijan, too, tightened its vise-grip on power. Aliyev won reelection in October with 87 percent of the vote in a poll that observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said did not meet international standards. Baku has also faced international condemnation for the jailing of opposition journalists.And Georgia, which the United States has tried to hold up as a beacon of good governance in the region, continued to backslide on the democratic promise of the 2003 Rose Revolution.Lincoln Mitchell, a Columbia University professor and the author of the upcoming book ""Uncertain Democracy: U.S. Foreign Policy and Georgia's Rose Revolution,"" says the domestic politics of the three countries in the region are returning to what he calls ""strategic normalcy.""""Azerbaijan and Armenia are settling into [being] secular illiberal regimes that are really what we have in most of the former Soviet Union,"" Mitchell says. ""Georgia is a Western-oriented secular illiberal regime. And that causes it some problems. But in fact, the states look more similar now than they did five years ago.""Watershed ConflictIf the South Caucasus is indeed entering a new period of increased Russian influence and democratic retrenchment, the watershed event will clearly be the five-day war between Georgia and Russia in August.Since coming to power after the 2003 Rose Revolution, Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili had infuriated Moscow by moving his country closer to the West and seeking to join NATO.In a recent interview with RFE/RL, Matthew Bryza, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, called the war a defining moment.Bryza has condemned Moscow's actions in Georgia.""It is a watershed because Russia demonstrated that it is willing to be a belligerent and use force against smaller neighbors,"" Bryza said. ""In fact, against a neighbor with a military that is maybe 1/100th of its size. That act has sent some powerful signals reverberating through the Caucasus.""The conflict began on August 7 when Georgian forces entered the Moscow-backed breakaway region of South Ossetia, claiming that separatist forces were shelling Georgian villages. Russia responded with a massive retaliation with its forces thrusting deep into Georgia.Russia pulled its troops out of most of Georgia proper following a French-brokered cease-fire. But Moscow continues to keep a large contingent of forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another pro-Moscow breakaway Georgian province. Russian troops also continue to occupy a so-called ""buffer zone"" around the two regions.Following the conflict, Moscow recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but only Nicaragua has followed suit.And the war resulted in a much larger Russian footprint in the region. ""There is a bigger Russian role in the region because now they [Russians] formally control South Ossetia and Abkhazia,"" Lincoln Mitchell says. ""There's a bigger Russian role in the region because the only anti-Russian voice in the region just got its hat handed to them by the Russian military.""Russian RealpolitikAnd although Moscow faced harsh international criticism for what many in the West called a ""disproportionate"" response, it was able to weather the storm. The European Union suspended talks on a Partnership and Association Agreement, but decided in December to renew negotiations. The NATO-Russia Council was also suspended, although at a foreign ministers meeting in December the alliance decided to revive informal high-level meetings with Moscow.At the same foreign ministers meeting, NATO declined to grant Georgia and Ukraine Membership Action Plans (MAPs), a key step to membership, setting back Tbilisi's goal of joining the alliance quickly. Eight months earlier, at NATO's summit in Bucharest, facing fierce lobbying from Russia, the allies also declined to give Georgia and Ukraine MAPs. The alliance did, however, promise eventual membership for the two countries.Apparently, many Western countries believe that the costs of alienating or isolating Russia are just too high, and Moscow is aware of this. ""Moscow has quite skillfully weaved its way through this situation. Western countries are faced with a conundrum, and that is choosing between Georgia as a strategic ally, or Russia,"" Lawrence Sheets says.""Russia is a country of 150 million people with massive energy resources and nuclear weapons. Georgia is a developing country of 4 million people,"" he adds. ""I think inevitably realpolitik becomes part of it and the Russians see that the price to be paid is often short-term and one of rhetoric, and doesn't boil down to much that is concrete.""Georgia's leadership also did not help its own case in its NATO bid. Saakashvili came under heavy criticism for what diplomats and analysts describe as an ill-advised move to try to resolve the South Ossetia conflict by force.Moreover, Georgia's reputation as a beacon of democracy in the region began to wane in November 2007 when Saakashvili cracked down on opposition demonstrations in Tbilisi and temporarily closed down independent media outlets.Saakashvili won reelection as president in January. And his party, the United National Movement, won a decisive majority in parliamentary elections in May, albeit amidst allegations of voter intimidation and bullying.Hopes For Karabakh PeaceIf Georgia was preoccupied with war, the focus in Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to resolving the region's other frozen conflict -- Nagorno-Karabakh.On November 2, following Russian-mediated talks in Moscow, Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed the first joint statement by Yerevan and Baku since the 1994 truce that ended the Nagorno-Karabakh war. Despite the tensions in U.S.-Russian relations over Georgia, Bryza stressed that Washington welcomed Moscow's efforts on Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic-Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan that broke free from Baku's control in the early 1990s in a war that killed an estimated 30,000 people.Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's ""meeting on November 2 made an important contribution. So I want to be fair here. When Russia is being unhelpful, we've got to call it like we see it. But Russia is being quite helpful on Karabakh.""The Moscow Declaration mainly reiterated previous positions, committing the two sides to resolving the conflict peacefully, according to international law, and under the auspices of the OSCE's Minsk Group comprising Russia, France, and the United States.Nevertheless, analysts took it as a sign that there could finally be movement on what has been a long-stalled peace process. ""Basically we have had a situation between Azerbaijan and Armenia that has not changed in 15 years for the most part,"" Sheets notes. ""And I think we are beginning to see the situation change. It is changing through external dynamics in regard to Armenia and Turkey and in regard to Russia's role in the region.""Armenia also made strides this year in improving its long-strained relations with Turkey. In a move dubbed ""football diplomacy,"" Sarkisian invited his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to Yerevan to watch an international soccer match between their national teams in September.The two held an extended closed-door meeting before heading off to the match, which Turkey won 2-0. Turkey was among the first countries to recognize Armenian independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union. But when Armenian forces occupied Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions, Ankara broke off diplomatic ties with Yerevan and closed its border with Armenia in solidarity with its ally Azerbaijan. Moreover, Yerevan's claim that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I constitutes genocide is angrily rejected by Turkey and continues to be a major roadblock in normalizing relations.With its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey closed, Armenia seeks to normalize relations with Ankara in hopes of facilitating greater trade and investment.",,,

There is a negotiation process going on [with Armenia].... This kind of debate is of no use to anyone especially at a time talks continue and it may harm the negotiation process,"" Babacan was quoted by the Anatolian news agency as saying.On December 17, Erdogan said the campaign, which has tested one of Turkey's most sensitive taboos, had no other benefit than ""stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace, and undoing the steps which have been taken.""President Abdullah Gul has hailed the initiative as proof of Turkey's democratic health. He became the first Turkish leader to visit Armenia in September as Turkey sought to end almost 100 year of animosity.Turkish and Armenian officials have expressed hopes of restoring full diplomatic relations soon.Turks, including Nobel Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk, have been prosecuted in the European Union candidate country for affirming that the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 amounted to genocide.Turkey accepts that many Armenians were killed during the waning years of the Ottoman Empire, but rejects Armenian assertions, backed by Western historians, it was genocide, saying that Muslim Turks also died in interethnic conflicts.The apology, which avoids the word genocide and uses instead the term great catastrophe, has reignited a debate that challenges one of the ideological foundations of modern Turkey. It comes at a time of heightened nationalism in Turkey.Organisers have said the initiative, posted on the Internet (http://www.ozurdilivoruz.com) along with a nonbinding petition to gather signatures, was meant to allow Turks to offer a personal apology and to end an official silence.

The release of those individuals was a key demand of the two PACE resolutions on Armenia adopted following the disputed presidential election of February 19 and the March 1 violence in Yerevan. The PACE's Monitoring Committee said after a meeting in Paris late on December 17 that the Armenian authorities have failed to comply with those resolutions in full. It said the voting rights of the assembly's eight Armenian members must be suspended until the authorities ""have clearly demonstrated their political will to resolve this issue."" A new resolution drafted by the committee and made public on December 18 reads: ""Notwithstanding positive developments in some areas, the Assembly finds it unacceptable that persons have been charged and deprived of their liberty for political motivations and that political prisoners exist in Armenia."" More than 100 associates and supporters of opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrossian were arrested in the wake of the presidential vote. Some 70 members of the opposition remain in prison. The vast majority of them have already received prison sentences on charges mainly stemming from the deadly March 1 clashes in Yerevan.In its proposed resolution, the Monitoring Committee noted that a ""significant number"" of those sentences were based solely on police testimony, a practice condemned by PACE earlier this year. It also said that many of the opposition detainees have been prosecuted under articles of the Armenian Criminal Code dealing with organization of ""mass disturbances"" and attempts to ""usurp state authority."" The draft resolution says there are ""strong indications"" that these criminal cases were politically motivated. ""It follows that persons convicted on these charges can be considered political prisoners,"" it adds, rejecting Armenian government claims to the contrary. The Monitoring Committee recommended sanctions against Yerevan while welcoming President Serzh Sarkisian's recent decision to form a new, supposedly independent body tasked with investigating the postelection violence. Armenia's governing coalition and main opposition forces are equally represented in the Fact-Finding Group of Experts. Government Hopes To Avoid SanctionsThe Armenian government was quick to react to the committee's decision, with Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian describing it as ""not favorable"" for the country at a late-night news briefing on December 17. Nalbandian said the government hopes to avert Council of Europe sanctions during upcoming negotiations with the Monitoring Committee's two Armenia rapporteurs, John Prescott and Georges Colombier. They are due to visit Yerevan ahead of the next PACE session scheduled for late January. ""Perhaps there will be developments in January that will allow for a revision of that proposal,"" Nalbandian said.The minister might have hinted at a possible general amnesty for the jailed oppositionists, an option advocated by Council of Europe officials. The Monitoring Committee deplored the Armenian authorities' failure so far to declare such an amnesty. The committee's recommendations were criticized on December 18 by a spokesman for the ruling Republican Party (HHK). ""Having said that, we respect the opinion of our European colleagues and hope that the visit of John Prescott and Georges Colombier...will set the record straight,"" Eduard Sharmazanov told Arminfo news agency. The HHK's parliamentary leader, Galust Sahakian, predicted that PACE will not after all impose sanctions on Yerevan. ""I don't think that the Council of Europe will be so imprudent as to push us closer to other bodies,"" he told RFE/RL. ""The Muslim world also has certain structures."" Predictably, a representative of Ter-Petrossian's Armenian National Congress (HAK) defended the recommendations. ""In terms of political prisoners, Armenia has the worst record among the 47 Council of Europe member states,"" Hovannes Igitian told RFE/RL. ""Our record is even worse than Azerbaijan's."" For his part, Armen Harutiunian, the state human rights ombudsman, said: ""You can't ensure democracy with sanctions. We ourselves must solve problems facing our country.""",,,

The men were taken into custody in the wake of violent clashes between security forces and supporters of former President and opposition presidential candidate Levon Ter-Pertrossian in March. For many in Armenia, the charges are regarded as unsubstantiated, even risible, while parallel investigations into the events that culminated in the violence continue. Immediately after Armenia's Central Election Commission announced early on February 20 that Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian won the previous day's presidential ballot with over 52 percent of the vote, supporters of Ter-Petrossian, who according to official returns placed second with 21.5 percent, congregated in Yerevan's Freedom Square to protest the perceived rigging of the outcome. Ter-Petrossian himself claimed to have polled no less than 65 percent. Violent ProtestsThe protests continued well into the early morning hours of March 1, when police moved in to disperse the participants by force. When they reassembled on the evening of the same day, the tensions escalated into open violence, with individual protesters attacking police and security forces, who in turn opened fire. Eight people were killed in the clashes, including two police officers; two more died later of their injuries. Outgoing President Robert Kocharian imposed a 20-day state of emergency and laid the blame for the violence squarely on Ter-Petrossian, whom Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian subsequently accused of employing mass hypnosis on the demonstrators. Even before the violence of March 1-2, police had set about rounding up prominent members of Ter-Petrossian's campaign staff. The detainees included opposition Hanrapetutiun party member Suren Sureniants, who was arrested on February 25 and spent two months in pretrial custody before a group of mostly pro-government legislators signed a petition calling for his release. The charges against him, which included inciting mass riots and attempting to seize power, were quietly dropped in June due to lack of evidence, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on June 13. Eyewitness Recounts March CrackdownLess fortunate was Harutiun Urutian, who headed Ter-Petrossian's campaign in the northern Shirak region. He was sentenced in April to seven years in prison (later reduced on appeal to six years) on charges, which he claimed were politically motivated, of assaulting a member of Sarkisian's campaign staff on polling day. Another Ter-Petrossian campaign official, Hovannes Harutiunian, was sentenced in April to 18 months' imprisonment for illegal possession of ammunition. Petros Makeyan, head of the small Democratic Fatherland Party, and Ashot Zakarian, head of the Giumri chapter of the Yerkrapah Union of Veterans of the Karabakh War, were jailed for three and 2 1/2 years, respectively, in June for obstructing the work of election precinct officials on February 19. In all, more than 100 people were taken into custody either in the week leading up to March 1-2 or immediately after the violence. Ter-Petrossian's camp argues that at least 70 of them should be designated political prisoners. As of mid-October, 43 had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, 37 received suspended sentences, and five were acquitted, according to a Prosecutor-General's Office spokesperson quoted by Noyan Tapan. Jail Terms Since mid-October, two more prominent Ter-Petrossian loyalists have been sentenced to jail terms. Former senior Interior Ministry official Mushegh Saghatelian was jailed for five years on October 23, and former Minister of State Revenues and Hanrapetutiun party member Sambat Ayvazian for two years on November 19, both on charges of violently resisting police. Ayvazian's conviction was based solely on police testimony, as was that of 19 of those sentenced earlier. In a statement dated October 2, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) condemned that practice as ""unacceptable."" The trial opened on September 1 and is still ongoing of former Deputy Prosecutor-General Gagik Djahangirian, who publicly affirmed his support for Ter-Petrossian at a postelection rally on February 22. Djahangirian suffered what was termed an ""accidental"" gunshot wound when police stopped his car on the outskirts of Yerevan the following evening and arrested him. He too is charged with seeking the violent overthrow of the incumbent regime. The opposition newspaper ""Chorrord ishkhanutiun"" commented on December 12 that the authorities have taken a ""differentiated"" approach to those arrested in connection with the postelection protests and are acting more harshly against people who were not in opposition prior to the 2008 presidential election race. Supporters of Ter-Petrossian claimed their candidate had won the election The paper suggests Kocharian and Sarkisian cannot forgive the latter for aligning with Ter-Petrossian and thereby ""dealing a serious blow to the ruling regime."" International Criticism The Armenian government initially remained impervious to repeated criticism from international organizations, first of the conduct of the February 19 ballot, then of the March 1-2 violence, and finally of the court proceedings against Ter-Petrossian supporters. But in mid-June, the Armenian parliament established an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 1-2 violence. It was initially envisaged that the commission would present its findings by October 25. On October 13, however, its members formally asked the parliament to extend that deadline for two months in order to enable them to incorporate the findings of a smaller, more independent fact-finding group established in July under pressure from the PACE. Ter-Petrossian declined to nominate a representative to the parliamentary commission, but his Armenian National Congress is represented on the independent body. In its October 2 statement, PACE registered alarm and concern at the situation of those people still held in pretrial detention and the ""excessive length of the investigation,"" and urged that they be brought to trial promptly. It also voiced doubts that some of those already sentenced had received a fair trial, suggesting that at least some were ""convicted based on political beliefs and nonviolent activities,"" and expressed ""regrets that the Armenian authorities did not consider the possibility of amnesty or pardons."" The seven men whose trial begins on December 19 are Aleksandr Arzumanian, who served under Ter-Petrossian as foreign minister and headed his campaign staff; former pro-government parliament members Miasnik Malkhasian and Hakob Hakobian; Sasun Mikayelian; Suren Sirunian; Shant Haroutiunian; and Grigor Voskerchian. All seven insist they are innocent of the charges against them, which they consider politically motivated. PACE Human Rights Commissioner Thomas Hammarberg observed on a visit to Yerevan last month that ""I have not so far seen any strong evidence which would make it possible for an independent court to sentence these seven persons for attempting to change power in this country with violence."" The imminent trial of the seven was one of the topics that Sarkisian discussed on December 16 with visiting OSCE Secretary-General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut. Also on December 16, parliament member Artsvik Minasian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun, which is part of the ruling four-party coalition, told journalists that Sarkisian may declare a general amnesty for all those sentenced to date, whether or not they pled guilty. Such a gesture might defuse simmering tensions, and preclude the possibility of new violent protests if the seven receive draconian sentences. On December 5, three men sentenced to jail terms ranging from three to 3 1/2 years for their participation in the March clashes were formally pardoned by Sarkisian after admitting their guilt, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on December 8. And on December 17, it was announced that coup charges similar to those faced by the ""seven"" brought against four other prominent oppositionists -- former Prime Minister Aram Sarkisian (no relation to Serzh); Ararat Zurabian, and Karapet Rubinian, both prominent members of Ter-Petrossian's Armenian Pan-National Movement; and former deputy National Security Service head Gurgen Yeghiazarian -- have been dropped for lack of evidence. Aram Sarkisian was never taken into custody, and the other three were released from detention several months ago.",,,0

But Gila Benmayor, a writer with Turkey's ""Hurriyet"" newspaper, says the petition is not meant to offend anyone, but is merely an expression of shared grief.Gregory Stanton, the president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars and head of the Genocide Watch pressure group, says it is essential for the Turkish government to acknowledge the genocide as a way for both Yerevan and Ankara to move on from the past.""One of the things we've discovered in studying genocide is that post-traumatic stress syndrome actually is inherited -- that is, it's passed on from one generation to the next,"" Stanton says. ""So if you have this kind of trauma, it can actually affect future generations. And it's one of the reasons I'm convinced that the Pontic Greeks, for instance, and the Armenians from the Anatolia region of the Ottoman Empire are so concerned about having their genocides acknowledged, even though Turkey doesn't want to acknowledge it.""And it's too bad, because really -- the current Turkish government didn't carry out that genocide,"" Stanton continues. ""It would be very healthy for the Turkish government to acknowledge what happened in the past, just as the German government has acknowledged what the Nazis did.""Seen As BetrayalThe signatories are certainly not without courage. Despite the lapse of 90 years, the issue is still red hot. Turkish nationalists regard any attempt to brand Turks as genocidal as a betrayal of the country.Only last year, Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was shot dead in Istanbul after repeated use of the word genocide to describe what had happened to the Armenians in 1915. His assassin was a teenage nationalist.Meanwhile, in Yerevan, a group of 30 Armenian intellectuals have written an open letter to Turkish President Abdullah Gul, urging him to recognize the genocide. Referring to the almost century-old enmity between their two nations, the signatories say the historic memory of both nations is ""deep and disturbing.""The chairman of the Union of Armenian Writers, Levon Ananian, says the fact that people on both sides of the closed Turkish-Armenian border are preoccupied with the same issue gives grounds for hope.""The letter of Armenian intellectuals to Abdullah Gul and the initiative of Turkish intellectuals unequivocally prove that the wall between two countries -- the closed border -- can be demolished because we are starting to recognize each other,"" Ananian says. ""When we recognize each other, then we have to try to understand each other. If we understand, then we should come to certain conclusions."" The December 9 open letter is meant to capitalize on the success of Gul's unprecedented visit to Yerevan in September, to attend a soccer match. That visit has led to a substantial thaw in relations, including talks between the two foreign ministers.But until there is official Turkish recognition of the genocide, says the letter from Armenian intellectuals, there can be no real reconciliation between the two sides.",,,

The foreign ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were in Brussels for their annual working lunch with EU counterparts, which was focused mainly on the details of the EU's new 'Eastern Partnership' initiative.Apprehensive of Russian anger and facing domestic publics deeply wary of further enlargement, most EU member states appear to have no desire to move beyond the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) in their relations with the bloc's eastern neighbors. The ENP, in place since 2004, was touched up last week with the addition of an 'eastern' dimension, but it failed to open the path to EU membership.The EU publicly snubbed Georgia at the December 9 meeting, effectively telling the self-styled South Caucasus frontrunner that it has done everything it can to mitigate the aftereffects of the Georgian-Russian war in August.Giorgi Baramidze, Georgia's state minister for Euro-Atlantic integration who sat in for newly appointed Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze, appealed to the EU to expand the scope of its monitoring mission in Georgia to Russian-occupied areas and upgrade its status.""We expressed our willingness to further consult with our European colleagues in order to further strengthen the European monitoring mission and eventually transform it to a full-fledged [European Security and Defense Policy] peacekeeping or police mission,"" Baramidze said.Baramidze said such a move would be ""very important"" for the security of both Georgia and the entire South Caucasus region. He also said it would help solve the ""human rights crisis"" in Akhalgori and the Liakhvi Gorge, Georgian-populated areas in the contested regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, respectively.However, EU foreign-policy chief Javier Solana curtly rebuffed the Georgian appeal.""We have a full-fledged monitoring mission now, the monitoring mission, which is on the ground,"" Solana said. ""That is the agreement we had at [the level] of [the] 27 [EU member states]; that is the agreement we had with Russia at the beginning and with Georgia always, and we don't have in mind for the moment to move beyond that level.""Solana said the EU has ""good relations"" with both the Georgian government and the Russian forces on the ground, having secured the latter's withdrawal from undisputed Georgian territory in October.He indicated the EU would continue to fine-tune its presence in Georgia while respecting limits set by Russia.Solana also expressed the hope that the upcoming third round of the Russian-Georgian talks in Geneva on South Ossetia and Abkhazia ""will be better than the second round."" The two sides remain deadlocked over the status of the two breakaway provinces, which Moscow has recognized as independent states.The Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers both praised the leadership of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who last month signed a declaration jointly with the two countries' presidents committing them to a peaceful resolution of the frozen conflict of Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia's Eduard Nalbandian and Azerbaijan's Elmar Mammadyarov both said they see no need for a greater EU role beyond the current limited reconciliation efforts spearheaded by the bloc's special representative, Peter Semneby, and the French co-chairmanship of the Minsk Group.Neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan appear to attach particular importance to the EU's 'Eastern Partnership' offer made last week, and neither asked for a membership prospect.Queried about his country's ambitions relating to Brussels, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Mammadyarov deflected the issue, saying it was ""a very good question, but probably should be addressed to the European Union, how they are addressing us.""""It is not a one-way street,"" Mammadyarov said. Georgian Minister Baramidze said Georgia would ""sooner or later"" become an EU member.This time, it was EU External-Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner who poured cold water on Georgian enthusiasm, saying the ENP only amounts to a ""stepwise"" integration of EU neighbors, adding that ""membership is not part of our policy.""",,,

The November 2 announcement reasserted the mediating role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group and took as the basis for further discussion the principles presented to the conflict sides in November 2007 in Madrid at the annual OSCE foreign ministers meeting.On December 4, at this year's OSCE foreign ministers meeting in Helsinki, the Russian and French foreign ministers and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, representing the three countries that jointly co-chair the Minsk Group, issued a joint statement hailing the so-called Moscow Declaration as ""the beginning of a new and very promising phase in our joint effort to extend peace in the South Caucasus.""They called on ""all sides to the conflict"" (specifically referring to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic, which is not represented at the formal peace talks) to take concrete measures within the next few months toward reaching agreement on the basic principles for resolving the conflict. Specifically, the three diplomats urged the parties to engage in confidence-building measures, including the withdrawal by both sides of snipers deployed along the Line of Contact separating the Armenian and Azerbaijani armed forces.U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza, who also serves as the U.S. Minsk Group co-chairman, told RFE/RL in Helsinki that the co-chairs and the conflict sides ""need to build on the momentum"" of the Moscow Declaration, and specifically ""to see the basic principles finalized."" ""And we believe they can be soon,"" he said.Bryza said it is hoped that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will meet ""within a couple of weeks"" to formalize a rapprochement of their respective positions. Fried, speaking on December 5, was even more upbeat, saying a settlement of the conflict ""has never been closer.""Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov, however, told journalists in Helsinki on December 5 that the next meeting between the Armenian and Azerbaijan presidents will take place only in early 2009. He also said the Minsk Group co-chairs presented himself and his Armenian counterpart, Eduard Nalbandian, with unspecified amendments to the basic principles on which consensus was reached in Madrid last year. Such a reference to ""amendments"" to the basic principles may be related to the confidence-building-measures section of the Moscow Declaration, especially as Azerbaijan has long withheld its agreement to such a provision. In this regard, the Moscow Declaration is doubly significant, not only as the first document signed by the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents, but also in terms of a new Azerbaijani recognition of the need for confidence-building measures, which represents an important shift in Baku's long-standing position.Those so-called Madrid Principles are believed to comprise specific aspects of an earlier, broader blueprint for resolving the conflict on which Armenia and Azerbaijan have reportedly already reached agreement, with unresolved issues clearly designated as such. That broader framework, the original Basic Principles, was made public in June 2006. It comprises a ""phased-package"" approach to resolving the conflict, meaning that the various elements of a settlement are agreed on simultaneously, even though they are implemented successively, with one key aspect -- the final status of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic -- to be decided by ""a referendum or vote."" While the time frame for that referendum is not specified in the Basic Principles, two of the co-chairs have indicated that it is between 10 and 15 years after a comprehensive peace agreement is finalized.The Basic Principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh, with special modalities for the Kelbacar and Lachin districts that separate Karabakh from Armenia. All sides are required to renounce the use or threat of force; the territories would be demilitarized; and an international peacekeeping force deployed there based on an undefined mission mandate. A referendum or popular vote would be agreed, at an unspecified future date, to determine the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh. At present, however, the two sides remain far apart on the issue of who exactly would be eligible to participate. International financial assistance would be made available for a wide range of postconflict development projects, including de-mining, reconstruction, and resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the war-affected regions of Nagorno-Karabakh.New 'Principles'?The Azerbaijani website echo-az.com published on November 13 what it claimed was the text of the Madrid Principles, which differ from the Basic Principles in proposing an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh until its final status is determined by a referendum. The purported document also advocates enhancing the role of the EU special representative to the South Caucasus in liaising with the OSCE Minsk Group. Neither the Minsk Group nor the Armenian or Azerbaijani government has either confirmed or denied the authenticity of that draft. Meanwhile, the Azerbaijani delegation in Helsinki has muddied the waters by circulating yet another set of ""principles"" that Baku apparently insists should be incorporated into the final settlement document. As summarized on December 5 by day.az, those principles are based on the preservation of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Crucially, they stress that the ""military occupation,"" meaning the occupation by Armenian armed forces of seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on Nagorno-Karabakh, be decoupled from the rest of the peace process.In other words, Azerbaijan insists that the process of determining the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan -- a process that must take place with the ""direct, complete, and equal participation"" of both the present Armenian population of the enclave and its former Azerbaijani residents, and on the basis of their ""constructive cooperation with the Azerbaijani government"" -- may get under way only after the withdrawal of all Armenian forces from the seven occupied districts.That renewed insistence that Armenia should effectively surrender its key bargaining chip (the occupied territories) without having obtained any comparable concession in return cannot but compound the apprehension of many in Armenia -- including the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun that is a member of the coalition government -- who fear an imminent sellout by President Serzh Sarkisian in the wake of the secret talks that preceded the historic visit to Armenia in early September by Turkish President Abdullah Gul. The Moscow Declaration, however, sought to allay Armenian concerns over that approach. The third point of that declaration commits the signatories to an agreement that the process of hammering out a peaceful settlement should be underpinned by ""legally binding international guarantees"" regarding each successive step to be undertaken.",,,1

""It shows that the European Union is quite serious about making a difference. It's always easy to talk, but it seems that the European Union is willing to put some money where its mouth is.""Reward For ReformsThe proposal calls for free trade deals, closer energy ties, visa liberalization, and financial assistance programs as a reward for making democratic and free market reforms.Belarus, however -- which has been branded ""Europe's last dictatorship"" -- must initiate democratic reforms before it can qualify.EU leaders will debate the program when they meet in Brussels next week.The six beneficiary countries have warmly welcome the plan, despite concerns over its implementation.""Who will spend this money? It's very important,"" asks Vefa Guluzadeh, a former foreign policy adviser to ex-Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev. ""If the money is given to these countries' governments, who knows how it will be spent? There is a high level of corruption in all of these counties. I think it will make sense if this money goes to people who are in need, or to projects that need it.""The scheme, which stops short of offering any firm prospect of EU membership, is also bound to disappoint many in EU hopeful Ukraine and Moldova. Some officials, like Andriy Veselovsky, Ukraine's ambassador to the EU, nonetheless view the proposal as a step toward eventually joining the European Union.""This is definitely a step toward Ukraine's membership in the European Union,"" he told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. ""Why go through the trouble otherwise?"" Gained New ImportanceThe Eastern Partnership was launched earlier this year but gained new importance following the August war between Russia and Georgia, which underscored Moscow's increasingly assertive stance and raised the threat of political instability in the region.The partnership also fits into Europe's drive to secure safe energy supplies -- all of the countries involved are either rich in oil and gas or are critical energy transit routes.European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso admitted that the commission had felt an urgency to act after the war in Georgia. But he stressed that Europe wasn't seeking to undermine Russian influence in a region that the Kremlin continues to regard as its own backyard.The bloc, he said, simply wants to support reforms that the six beneficiaries are willing to undertake. ""There is no Cold War,"" he said on December 3 while outlining the initiative.The EU plan will no doubt ruffle a few feathers in Moscow.But Barysch of the Centre for European Reform says the Kremlin is unlikely to pay close attention to the initiative.""I don't think that Russia is going to be overly upset by what is still essentially quite a bureaucratic process,"" Barysch says. ""The Russians take the [EU] eastward enlargement seriously because they see that it can create new borders within the European landmass. But I don't think they take the European neighborhood policy very seriously.""",,private,1

The two days of discussions in the Finnish capital are expected to focus on how to avoid conflicts on the territory of the 56-member OSCE, conflicts like the war between Russia and Georgia.The meeting is being attended by some 50 foreign ministers, the largest contingent of full ministers since the organization was founded.The OSCE chairman in office, Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, says the meeting will be out of the ordinary. He's referring to the size of the gathering -- some 1,200 delegates in all -- and also its content.'Dramatic Development'The two main themes are scheduled to be the impact of developments in the Caucasus region, especially in Georgia, on European security, and a Russian plan for a new European security pact, which will be presented for the first time by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. OSCE spokesman Martin Nesirsky describes the Russian-Georgian war as a ""dramatic development"" that is bound to color the atmosphere of the conference, but which won't necessarily poison it. The OSCE has come under criticism for reacting slowly to that war, and failing to stop it.Stubb said the Russia-Georgia conflict provides the OSCE with fresh motivation to work to avoid such events in future.""Now, the bad news is that we had a ferocious conflict and war in Georgia. It is something that I never want to see again. It was the first time in my life that I saw war close up. And this already gives me enough faith -- that we are here to try to solve these kinds of conflicts,"" Stubb said.As to the Russian security initiative, Stubb said the conference should listen ""with open ears and interest"" to what Lavrov has to say on European security.""This is going to be the first time -- first time -- that we discuss President [Dmitry] Medvedev's and [French] President [Nicholas] Sarkozy's proposals on a new European security,"" he said. ""And I think it is going to be a fascinating discussion. And I hope as chairman in office that, at the end of the day, we come out with a reinvigorated, stronger OSCE.""A top U.S. official signaled on December 3 that Washington sees the Russian initiative as an effort to weaken NATO.U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza told Reuters, ""There is no need for some new architecture and it's pretty transparent, I think, what that's all about. I think it's about looking for an alternative to NATO, which has worked so well. NATO makes Russia uncomfortable.""In Brussels on December 3, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also commented on the Russian plan, saying the allies are willing to discuss Moscow's proposals, but need to know their substance.'Improvement And Progress'OSCE ministers are also discussing the dispute between Azerbaijan with Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and Moldova's breakaway Transdniester region.In a joint statement, France, Russia, and the United States called on parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to build on the positive momentum established by the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan at their meeting in Moscow on November 2.The three countries co-chair the OSCE's Minsk Group, which seeks to resolve the dispute. They said a ""new and promising phase"" has opened in the shared attempt to expand peace in the South Caucasus. ""We need to build on the momentum of the meeting in Moscow, we want to see the basic principles finalized, and they can be, soon, and we also want to see serious confidence-building measures, and finally we want to make sure that everyone realizes that there is only a peaceful settlement to this conflict; you cannot resolve this conflict in a military way,"" Bryza told RFE/RL.On other themes, the OSCE ministers are expected to confirm that Kazakhstan, despite its democratic shortcomings, will become the first ex-Soviet republic to take the OSCE chairmanship in 2010. One key figure who is not present in Helsinki is U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who cancelled her attendance to fly instead to India and Pakistan in a bid to cool the heat generated by the Mumbai terror attacks.",,,

In a statement, the commission said the EU has ""a vital interest in seeing better governance and economic development"" in Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Belarus, as well as an interest in reducing Russia's influence over them.Barroso said commission felt an urgency to act after Russia's aggression toward Georgia, which led to a brief but intense war between the two countries in August. But he said the proposed partnership is ""not about drawing a new division of Europe."" Rather, he said, the EU wants to support reforms that the ex-Soviet republics are willing and ready to make.Under the new program, the 27-member EU will draw up new agreements with the six countries as a reward for making democratic and free market reforms.The 350 million euros ($443 million) in new aid will go toward strengthening state institutions, border control, and assistance for small companies. The EU has now pledged 1.5 billion euros in aid to its eastern neighbors by 2020.External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said, ""the time is ripe to open a new chapter in relations"" with the six countries and noted that the new agreement will have a strong multilateral dimension.""That means platforms where the different countries of this neighborhood partnership can sit together and can learn from each other -- can see what has been the best practice in one country, [and ask] how can we do better?""Ferrero-Waldner stressed that one of the goals of the new partnership is to create a ""free-trade area"" among the countries that could lead to a ""neighborhood economic community between the region and the European Union. The partnership will be mutually beneficial, she said.""On energy, it is for their own energy security but it's exactly also for our energy security,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""Again, this is a win-win situation. It matches our interests.""All of the countries involved are either rich in oil and gas or are critical transit countries for energy from Russia and other eastern states.A summit is planned with the leaders of the six countries sometime in the first half of 2009. Belarus, which is ruled by a man many call ""Europe's last dictator,"" President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, must initiate democratic reforms before it can qualify for the EU aid plan.The plan does not discuss EU membership, which Georgia and Ukraine in particular are keen to achieve. Still, it is likely to irritate Russia, which considers the countries as part of its sphere of influence. But Barroso told reporters, ""there is no Cold War"" and said ""there not be any spheres of influence.""EU leaders will debate the proposal when they meet in Brussels next week.",,private,1
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1354244.html,Roundtable Is EU Choosing Stability Over Democracy In The South Caucasus ,"November 28, 2008 14:57 GMT",,Armenian and Azerbaijan elections lead to violence,"It's been a rocky year in the South Caucasus. Questionable elections in both Armenia and Azerbaijan ended with bloodshed in one and a dynasty digging in deeper in the other. Georgia, meanwhile, is still reeling from a devastating war with Russia in August. In a season when the region is looking west for guidance, what role has the European Union played through all this? As part of RFE/RL's ""Caucasus Crossroad"" program, Russian Service broadcaster Yefim Fistein spoke to Leyla Yunus, the director of the Baku-based Peace and Democracy Institute, David Shahnazaryan of the Concord center for political and legal studies in Yerevan, and Giorgi Gogsadze, a professor of social and political studies at Tbilisi State University. The roundtable was conducted on November 12.RFE/RL: Giorgi, how satisfied are most Georgians with the role that the EU, and especially French President Nicolas Sarkozy, played in ending the Russia-Georgia war? Giorgi Gogsadze: Overall, you can say that the Georgian public reacted fairly positively to the way the EU and particularly Sarkozy reacted to the events in Georgia. More time needs to pass before we can draw definite conclusions about how the EU acted, or how it should be acting. But everything that's taken place so far has gone according to plan. The first stage is complete; Russian forces have withdrawn from the buffer zone. The second stage will be sending in EU and OSCE observers onto the territory of the conflict zone. It seems to me that this second stage may become a drawn-out process, and this may cause a certain amount of frustrations among Georgians. But I'm hopeful that the EU will play a very important role and will be an active organization in this process. That would be something we didn't see before the conflict. EU's South Caucasus PolicyRFE/RL: Leyla, how have you seen the EU's policy evolve on the South Caucasus, and Azerbaijan specifically? Leyla Yunus: In August, we were all left with the distinct impression that we were defenseless against aggression from the north. It was easy to predict that there was going to be a war of aggression by Russia against Georgia. All the same, there was no system of defense prepared whatsoever. And after Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the system of international security collapsed. We had the feeling that any state could force its way over your border and legally occupy your territory. I think the European Union should summon the political will it needs to create a system of defense for the countries of the South Caucasus, and perhaps not only our countries, from Russian aggression. Azerbaijan, like Georgia and Armenia, is a member of the European Neighborhood Policy aimed at EU integration. Before August, we could feel at least a little movement on this -- a little pressure on Azerbaijan to implement the plan's requirements. Now it's perfectly plain that the European Commission and the EU members states are simply avoiding making any demands on the leadership of Azerbaijan regarding democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. They're just steering clear of it. So our president, Ilham Aliyev, has completely reoriented himself back toward Moscow. Energy interests come first. This is very, very dangerous for our region. RFE/RL: You said that the EU is acting as though its indifference to the suppression of human rights will ensure them good ties with Aliyev. But are there really those who believe the practice of suppressing human rights really guarantee stable relations?Yunus: That kind of system has existed in countries like Azerbaijan for many years already. Azerbaijan has been a member of the Council of Europe since 2001; in 2006, it signed an action plan for the European Neighborhood Policy. This action plan is not being fulfilled. In April of this year, the European Commission published its first report on what steps, if any, Azerbaijan had taken toward fulfilling the plan. In the period it covered, the year 2007, there were a record number of court cases against members of the media -- 103. Ten journalists serving jail sentences were named prisoners of conscience. There were 95 physical attacks on journalists. Not a single one of these numbers was mentioned in the report. Thousands protested Armenian election results in February 2008In the chapter where they talked about things like freedom of assembly and a free press and judiciary, they speak only in generalities. We haven't had the right to free assembly -- like our neighbors in Georgia have, for example -- since 2005. But there's been absolutely no harsh criticism of Azerbaijan of any kind from either the EU or the Council of Europe. It's a very nearsighted position. The authoritarian regime that we have in Azerbaijan doesn't guarantee stability. It doesn't guarantee democratic development if the political opposition is destroyed and there are no free democratic elections. The society is becoming radicalized. Radical viewpoints are developing regarding the Karabakh conflict. RFE/RL: David, has the EU position on Armenia remained more or less the same? Thousands protested Armenian election results in February 2008David Shahnazaryan: I'd put it more bluntly. EU policy toward our region -- all three countries -- clings to a formula: stability over all. Stability is far more important than democracy. There are a lot of facts to support this. Some have already been mentioned; I'll mention some that relate to my country. Armenia currently has 75 political prisoners. The EU, in the form of the presidency, twice spoke out after the [February 19] presidential elections. One of their demands was the immediate release of all political prisoners. The leadership, the illegitimate leadership in Armenia, simply ignored this. And the EU -- pardon the expression -- simply swallowed it clean, as though nothing had happened.The EU and some other international organizations also ignored the fact that the results of the Armenian elections were completely falsified. And after the vote, the authorities shot and killed innocent people. On March 1, 10 people were killed in Yerevan. The European community -- first and foremost the EU -- closed their eyes to all that. We demanded that an international investigation be conducted into those events, but that met with no understanding in Brussels or the other European capitals. In Armenia today, there's this kind of ingrained conviction that European values may be one thing, but that actual European structures are something completely different. And we understand perfectly well that we will have to establish these European values without any help or support from the European structures.Czech EU PresidencyRFE/RL: Many commentators say that Moscow wants to complete the talks before the next EU presidency begins on January 1. Moscow believes the current EU leadership under Sarkozy will be more accommodating than the Czech leadership that will follow. Giorgi, what's your opinion on this? In particular, about the cease-fire agreement. A lot of people say problems were caused because Sarkozy didn't have a good understanding of the situation on the ground. He didn't understand the difference between the territory of the two autonomous regions and that of the rest of Georgia. As a result, Russian forces sometimes ended up on Georgian territory. Now in the Western press you sometimes see the idea of Russian forces pulling back to the territory of the two republics being confused with calls for Russian forces to leave Georgia entirely. That is, they are setting up the status quo before the war as the final status quo of the cease-fire. Questions about changes to that status quo are not discussed. The war in Georgia was a considerable challenge for EU policymakersGogsadze: I don't agree with those experts. The point is that in the agreement between Sarkozy and Medvedev it is clearly written that Russia must return to those points that existed before August 7, before the beginning of the conflict. This concerns the number of forces and the location of the so-called peacekeepers. But this is where things got stuck. Russia now insists that there is a new reality, that now that South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been recognized, they must decide themselves who will be where and in what numbers. And these republics now say they have agreed with Russia about the opening of military bases on the territories of these republics. So now Russia is already manipulating a completely different reality. And, naturally, Russia does not want to return to the status quo that existed before August 7. The European Union must stick firmly to its principles, and it must pressure the Russian government to comply with all the points of the Medvedev-Sarkozy agreement.RFE/RL: But is it realistic to expect that? Won't the EU give in to the pressure of the fait accompli that Russia is presenting?Gogsadze: Of course they'll give in. Some are saying the slogan is stability versus democracy. I think it's actually a case of energy versus democracy, or even versus state sovereignty. I'm afraid that Old Europe will be on the side of stability -- that is, on the side of Russia. But New Europe -- meaning the former socialist bloc countries -- they have been acting in a very principled way. So it is no surprise that Russia is afraid of the Czech presidency of the EU.RFE/RL: David, how do people in Armenia feel about the efforts of several EU countries to ratify the Lisbon agreement and create a foreign minister's post for the bloc? Would that make your relations easier or more difficult?Shahnazaryan: I think this would definitely help, because today most experts view the European Union as merely an economic formation that has no coherent foreign policy or security policy. This is a common opinion, and, I think, a justifiable one. I think the creation of a foreign minister would help the EU work out a common foreign policy and a common security policy. And I also really hope it will help turn attention away from the mistaken policy that stability trumps democracy. Because we are already seeing the results of this policy in the South Caucasus, where we have neither democracy nor stability.EU DivisionsRFE/RL: But isn't it likely that creating this post in the absence of a real united bloc will just mean that this person will be unable to make independent decisions? Wouldn't such a system mean we'd stop hearing the voices of the new members and hear only the voices of those who don't want to place principles and values above pragmatic concerns? Yunus: Here the best hope lies in the Polish-Swedish Eastern Partnership initiative. If the Poles alone had put forth this initiative -- which is a new project for the EU's work with the countries of the South Caucasus plus Moldova and Ukraine and possibly Belarus -- maybe it would have seemed like, well, just the Poles. But it is a Polish-Swedish initiative, and Germany has since moved to support it. Now it's already being discussed as an adopted project, and it's possible that in December a structure to implement the project will be created. This all indicates that a door -- or at least a small window -- has been opened a bit, and it's possible to put forward initiatives. I agree with my colleagues from Georgia and Armenia that the current policies of the European Union are not only ineffective, but also very shortsighted. How can we talk about stability in the South Caucasus after August? How can we talk about stability when the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict is on the edge of erupting? Today we have no protection from outside aggression or from terrorist acts. And the main thing is that in the countries of the South Caucasus -- and I'm talking first of all about my country, Azerbaijan -- an Asian-type despotism has been established. Our citizens have lost the ability to elect their leaders in a peaceful, political process -- legislative, executive, etc. Our last elections were basically a rebirth of the Soviet Union. In such circumstances, when people hear various commissars who come in from Brussels talk about partnership, they are extremely skeptical. As a result, the authority of liberal values is in decline among the population of the country. And this is very dangerous. In this situation, I think that it is vital to demonstrate political will and a unified policy on the part of all the countries of the European Union in relation to the geopolitically important region of the South Caucasus.RFE/RL: I personally wonder just how important stability in the South Caucasus is for the countries of Western Europe, and to what extent their perception of the South Caucasus is skewed by their energy dependence on Russia. Unlike Azerbaijan, Georgia has no oil, but perhaps for Georgia economic cooperation with Europe is of vital significance and could help overcome the economic boycott imposed by Russia. Is this aspect taken into account during discussions of the role the EU could play in Georgia?Gogsadze: Georgia has not suffered seriously from the impact of the economic blockade Russia imposed several years ago, but has nonetheless managed to move forward despite those restrictions. Perhaps the reason for Russia's aggression toward Georgia is that since economic pressure had no effect, Russia switched to military means. Relations with Europe, and in particular economic cooperation, are without doubt a key priority for Georgia, but as of today the primary question is that of stability and state sovereignty. I don't mean territorial integrity, but sovereignty, and this sovereignty either exists or it doesn't. For that reason, the Europeans and the Americans and the entire international community should adopt an absolutely principled stand on defending the sovereignty of independent states in order to prevent the emergence of new hotspots and regions of instability. RFE/RL: The recording of this discussion coincides with the EU-Russia summit in Nice (eds. held November 14). The EU wants that summit to focus on the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while Russia wants to discuss a new strategic partnership agreement with the EU. Poland and Lithuania wanted to make discussion of the second contingent on discussion of the first, while the countries of Western Europe for the most part tried so to speak to twist the Lithuanians' arm and dissuade them from taking that approach. How do the prospects for its success appear from the vantage point of the South Caucasus?Shahnazaryan: To be frank, I very much fear that despite that pressure from the new EU member states, Old Europe will prevail and Lithuania and the other countries will not succeed in defending, not their own interests, but a system of values and democracy. As for Russia's role and its influence in the South Caucasus, it is my firm conviction that after the August events Russia is now irrevocably withdrawing from the South Caucasus. This withdrawal creates an extremely explosive situation for us in the sense that the old world is receding, and whenever Russia withdraws it leaves nothing but ruins behind.I think all three South Caucasus states should work together to ensure that this Russian retreat should be as painless as possible. After what happened in Georgia, this is the beginning of the end of the Russian presence in the South Caucasus, because Russia retains a foothold in the region only thanks to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the fact that Armenian-Turkish relations are closed. As a result of what happened in August a new era has begun, an era which I would call that of Russia's withdrawal from the South Caucasus.RFE/RL: I would agree with you that sometimes national leaders seek to portray a withdrawal as the beginning of a new era. The question here is whether Russia has the means at its disposal to implement President Dmitry Medvedev's new doctrine that affirms Russia's privileged interests, including in the South Caucasus. But how has the global economic crisis, which has impacted on Europe no less than on Russia, affected Azerbaijan?Yunus: I would say that after August, we have the impression that Russia is not retreating from the South Caucasus, but returning. You may not have noticed, but the Azerbaijani leadership maintained constant contact with Moscow, and after Dick Cheney's visit to Baku [in early September] Ilham Aliyev immediately traveled to Moscow. Azerbaijan's political elite is economically tied to Russia. The money we receive for Azerbaijan's oil goes to the ruling family, while the population at large subsists on money sent by Azerbaijani migrant workers in Russia. So that if the entire economy goes into decline as happened in 1998, and the flow of cash from Russia to families in Azerbaijan decreases, the Azerbaijani economy will face major difficulties, no two ways about it. At present, Azerbaijan is Europe's only alternative supplier of energy. If Azerbaijan were to become closely integrated with the EU and the EU in turn guaranteed Azerbaijan's security and integrated not only Azerbaijan but the entire South Caucasus, and if the process of trying to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict took place within the framework of that process of integration with the EU, and if we were safe from aggression from the north, then Azerbaijan would really have an interest in channeling its energy resources to Europe via Georgia or Armenia. But as things are today I think that the EU is dragging its feet, and therefore it's possible Azerbaijan may orient itself totally toward Russia.RFE/RL: I suspect the EU is suffering from enlargement fatigue and dreads the prospect of Turkey and possibly also the South Caucasus states becoming members.Yunus: I'm not talking about EU membership, but about whether it's more expensive to drop bombs than to provide economic assistance to develop civil society.RFE/RL: Georgia is dead set on joining NATO. Why is it not devoting the same energy to integration with the EU?Gogsadze: Georgia is indeed active on that front, even though the Europeans have made it clear to us that for the next 15 years or so Europe's doors will remain closed not only to Georgia but to the other South Caucasus states. I think this was the biggest mistake on the part of the EU because any alliance or any country that does not dream of extending [its territory] is doomed to perish.",,,

""It is in the interest of Turkey to open the border and this is in the interest of Armenia,"" he said.Turkey closed its border with former Soviet Armenia in 1993 in a show of solidarity with Azerbaijan, a Turkic-speaking ally that was fighting Armenian-backed separatists over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian population broke away from Azerbaijan in a war as the Soviet Union fell apart. A solution to that dispute is seen as crucial to any move to establish diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia. Relations between the two have been strained by accusations that Ottoman Turks committed genocide by killing ethnic Armenians in World War I.Nalbandian's visit was part of a diplomatic push between Yerevan and Ankara to end a century of hostilities. Azerbaijani officials have also taken part in recent three-way talks.

It was the first time that officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan had signed such a joint document since Russia mediated a cease-fire agreement in 1994, putting an end to one of the deadliest wars in the former USSR.The so-called Moscow Declaration of Intent on Nagorno-Karabakh was an important diplomatic event in the 15-year long negotiating process. But it was much more important for Moscow, which thus reminded everyone that it holds the key to a solution to this conflict. The joint declaration was co-signed only by Russia, despite the fact that other two Minsk Group co-chairs, the United States and France, were also present. A closer look at the declaration leaves no doubt that much of what was discussed during the closed-door talks was not reflected on paper. The declaration is just another expression of intent by the two leaders that they are serious about seeking a peaceful solution and that the military option can no longer be considered an alternative to peaceful diplomacy.In short, both sides agreed on paper to tone down harsh military rhetoric and expedite the peace process. However, taking the text at face value would be overly optimistic. Questions AriseEvery time Russia steps up its mediation efforts, questions arise about its motives for doing so. The simple answer in this case would probably be that it wants at least to preserve the level of influence that it had in Armenia, and more importantly in Azerbaijan, which has long been suspicious about its real intentions in the region.Now that Georgia is out of the Russian sphere of influence, at least for the foreseeable future, Moscow will do all in its power to keep the two remaining South Caucasus countries, Armenia and Azerbaijan, under its control. The only way to do that is to act as an honest broker to bring about a settlement of the frozen, and potentially deadly, Karabakh conflict. Moscow's mediation could also be seen as an attempt to restore its credibility in the region following the war with Georgia, which further eroded its relations with the United States. Depending on who wins the U.S. presidential election, Moscow will try to showcase its good behavior to the new leadership in Washington. There is one important line in the joint declaration, which shows that Moscow will not mediate the potential peace deal alone, bypassing its American and French partners in the OSCE Minsk Group. The declaration clearly states that the peace process will proceed within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group based on the ""Madrid Principles"" endorsed by the OSCE Ministerial Council, which envisage the return of occupied Azerbaijani territories and the possibility of holding a referendum on the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh. High ExpectationsIt is hard to imagine that a Karabakh peace deal could be achieved without the United States, one of the major players in the OSCE Minsk Group. Azerbaijan and Armenia will not easily bow to Moscow's pressure without the approval of the new administration in Washington. It would therefore be premature to expect a breakthrough in the talks before January 2009, when the next U.S. president is sworn in.Armenians have high expectations for Democratic Senator Barack Obama, hoping that, if he is elected president, he will support their cause.""I will promote Armenian security by seeking an end to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades, and by working for a lasting and durable settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that is agreeable to all parties,"" Obama said in one of his campaign promises to Armenian-Americans.The Armenian government will seek help from the United States if it is pressured to give up Azerbaijani territories without obtaining guarantees that the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians will be able to hold a referendum on their future status. Some experts in Azerbaijan and Armenia believe that Russia might try to secure a substantial military presence in the conflict zone as part of the future peacekeeping force that is to be deployed once a peace agreement is signed. Azerbaijan will most probably seek support from the United States in ensuring that Russian troops do not return to Azerbaijan.The Georgian experience has demonstrated that once they come, they are unlikely to leave peacefully.",,,1

Visiting Yerevan two months ago, Turkish President Abdullah Gul affirmed Turkey's readiness to ""assist"" in resolving the Karabakh conflict.And third, the three presidents agreed that the search for a peaceful solution should be accompanied by ""legally binding international guarantees of all its aspects and stages.""From Yerevan's viewpoint, the primary weakness of the so-called Madrid Principles is that they require Armenia to relinquish its most important bargaining chip and withdraw from the seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on Nagorno-Karabakh that it currently controls before any decision has been made on the future status of the unrecognized republic vis-a-vis the central Azerbaijani government in Baku. That issue is to be decided by means of a referendum that may not take place until years after the Armenian withdrawal.'Confidence-Building Measures'Many Armenians are therefore concerned that, having regained control of the seven districts, the Azerbaijani government might then block the holding of the planned referendum.The Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun threatened on October 31 to quit the coalition government if President Serzh Sarkisian betrays ""national interests"" by agreeing to cede the occupied territories. One day earlier, on October 30, a group of prominent Armenian intellectuals and public figures announced the launch of a new movement, named Unification National Initiative, that will similarly actively oppose any territorial concessions to Azerbaijan.The proposed ""legally binding international guarantees"" are presumably intended to prevent any such perfidy on Baku's part, and thus reduce domestic political pressure on Sarkisian. The final point of the declaration similarly stresses the importance of ""confidence-building measures.""The international guarantees would presumably also encompass commitments by various states to provide international peacekeepers to be deployed in the seven liberated districts and the strategic Lachin corridor linking Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, too, can be pleased with the outcome of the November 2 talks, insofar as the declaration affirms a commitment by Russia to a positive role, promoting peace and stability in the South Caucasus in the wake of the August war with Georgia.",,,1

Read an analysis by RFE/RL's Liz Fuller here.In the resolution, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart, Serzh Sarkisian, pledged to intensify negotiations to end the dispute.Nagorno-Karabakh is a predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan that broke away from Baku's control in a war in the early 1990s.The talks were mediated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, whose country -- together with France and the United States -- co-chairs the Minsk Group, created by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) to broker a peace deal.'Activate Negotiation Process'Medvedev read a joint declaration during a signing ceremony after the talks.""The presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia decided to continue their work -- including at further high-profile talks -- to agree on a political settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,"" Medvedev said. ""They instructed their foreign ministers to activate the negotiation process, in collaboration with the co-chairs of the OSCE's Minsk Group.""The declaration, although merely reiterating previous positions, is still a breakthrough. It is the first official document signed by Yerevan and Baku on the issue since the 1994 truce that ended the Nagorno-Karabakh war.The presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia last met to discuss a peace plan just over four years ago in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana.The meeting, which was held on the fringes of a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit, had failed to jumpstart the peace process. Subsequent diplomatic efforts to solve the dispute also proved fruitless, including June talks between Aliyev and SarkisianBreakthrough 'Possible'The region has drawn increased diplomatic interest since Russia and Georgia went to war in August over another frozen conflict area, Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia.During a visit to Yerevan on October 17, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said a breakthrough on Nagorno-Karabakh was ""possible"" by year's end.The war there claimed an estimated 30,000 lives and forced about 1 million people from their homes, most of whom are still unable to return. The two sides are still technically at war because no peace treaty has been signed and crossborder skirmishes are still common.The talks outside Moscow, which were proposed last month by Medvedev, are widely viewed as a renewed Kremlin effort to consolidate its influence in the energy-rich Caspian after its brief war with Georgia raised tensions throughout the region.",,,1

But while all sides have publicly affirmed that the August war between Georgia and Russia has demonstrated the futility and risks inherent in trying to resolve conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union by military force, the Armenian and Azerbaijani negotiating positions still remain far apart on several key points.True, a framework agreement for resolving the Karabakh conflict already exists, in the form of the ""Madrid Principles"" presented by the French, U.S., and Russian Minsk Group co-chairmen to the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Madrid in November 2007. That blueprint in turn was based on the ""Basic Principles for the Peaceful Solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict"" that were made public in June 2006.The ""Basic Principles"" envisage the phased withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territories contiguous to Nagorno-Karabakh, including the district of Kelbacar and the strategic Lachin Corridor that links Armenia and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR); the demilitarization of those previously occupied territories; the deployment of an international peacekeeping force; demining, reconstruction, and other measures to address the impact of the conflict and expedite the return to their homes of displaced persons; and, finally, a referendum among the NKR population to determine the region's future status vis-a-vis the central Azerbaijani government in Baku.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by ""Rossiiskaya gazeta"" on October 7 as saying the two sides have reached agreement on all but two or three key points of the ""Madrid Principles"" and that there is ""a very real chance"" of resolving the conflict. Lavrov added that the main obstacle is lack of consensus on the future of the Lachin Corridor.Sticking PointsA second problematic issue is that of Karabakh's future status. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev reiterated on October 24 during his inauguration for a second presidential term that Azerbaijan will never agree to concede part of its territory. ""Karabakh will never be independent,"" news agencies quoted him as saying. ""Azerbaijan will never recognize it. Neither in five years, nor in 10, 20 years. Never.""Aliyev's Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian, for his part, told Armenian Public Television on October 27 following a visit to Nagorno-Karabakh during which he toured the heavily militarized Line of Contact between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces east of the NKR that ""a resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is possible if Azerbaijan recognizes the right of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to self-determination; if Nagorno-Karabakh has a land border with Armenia; and if international organizations and leading nations guarantee the security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.""Sarkisian also stressed on October 27 that Armenia continues to regard the ongoing talks chaired by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group as the sole forum for resolving the conflict. Turkish President Abdullah Gul's much-publicized offer during his visit to Yerevan on September 7 to ""assist"" in reaching a solution has been widely construed as a bid by Ankara to muscle in on the peace process. The French Minsk Group co-chair, Ambassador Bernard Fassier, has vehemently denied any such Turkish intent.Yerevan-based U.S. analyst Richard Giragosian too sees Medvedev's initiative as intended to counter and challenge a bid by Turkey to promote itself as a guarantor of stability in the South Caucasus. But even more important, Giragosian says, is Moscow's clear commitment to working together with Washington to achieving a solution to the conflict.""It is a sign that Russia remains committed to the ongoing OSCE Minsk Group peace process seeking a negotiated solution to Nagorno-Karabakh and, most importantly, despite the fact that this presidential summit is being hosted by the Russians, it is a demonstration and affirmation that the U.S. and Russia still share the same goals of pursuing the Minsk Group process and trying to negotiate a solution to this last frozen conflict in the South Caucasus,"" Giragosian says.""The U.S. and Russia do have areas of cooperation, do have areas where they could work together, and in many ways it is in Russia's interest to maintain at least the status quo regarding Nagorno-Karabakh,"" Giragosian adds, ""and both the U.S. and Russia remain committed to preventing any new escalation or outbreak of hostilities, especially to prevent Azerbaijan from trying to solve this unresolved conflict militarily.""From that point of view, therefore, simply hosting the summit may be perceived in Moscow as more important than any actual outcome.Speculation about a breakthrough in the peace process has focused not on the status issue, but the question of deploying international peacekeepers in the Lachin Corridor and the regions of Azerbaijan bordering the NKR that are currently controlled by Armenian forces. Some analysts have suggested Russia could insist that its 58th Army take on those responsibilities. But Armenian Defense Minister Colonel General Seyran Ohanian told the Armenian newspaper ""Iravunk-De Facto"" on October 31 that any peacekeeping force will not be 100 percent Russian.Meanwhile, concern is growing in Armenia that Sarkisian might be constrained to make a major concession, possibly on the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory, without securing any tangible benefits in return. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD) released a statement on October 31 warning that it will quit the coalition government if Sarkisian betrays ""national interests"" by agreeing to cede those territories.The day before, on October 30, a group of prominent Armenian intellectuals and public figures announced the launch of a new movement, named Unification National Initiative, that will actively oppose any territorial concessions to Azerbaijan.",,,

Obviously both sides will move very cautiously but, overall, I don't think the situation will be worse than what it is now.""If Mr. McCain is elected, we will probably observe a sort of continuation of the last two terms of President Bush. That means, for example, pressure on Iran on the nuclear issue will rise and more sanctions will be applied.""IraqAnalyst Omar al-Mashhadani:""I think U.S. foreign policy remains consistent irrespective of who may be the White House resident. What we have is a state run by institutions rather than a personalized administration. It is neither George Bush nor Obama or McCain but strategic and organizational institutions that run the country, especially in foreign policy. As for Iraq's interests and what may be harmful or favorable to these interests, there is no doubt that U.S. interests are above all else regardless of the nominees' or the president's position, which is quite appropriate. ""I think that even statements made by Obama about withdrawal from Iraq [to withdraw troops within 16 months of taking office] are meant for the media and it will be different once he sits in the Oval Office. The security pact being talked about these days [under which U.S. troops would leave Iraq by the end of 2011] is a case in point. The coming administration will be bound by this agreement. Neither Obama nor anyone else can change what George Bush has signed.""RussiaEconomist Mikhail Delyagin:Mikhael Delyagin""With any president the U.S. president will no longer be a 'lame duck.' America will show its elbows, it will pursue an active policy, which has been forgotten about. The United States will return to the direct struggle for global leadership. And for us it will be quite a significant problem for the ideology under which Russia has been getting back on its feet. ""Whatever happens, Pakistan will be chaotic and there will be destabilization of the world order in general. Whatever happens, there will be opposition between China and the United States, in which Russia will have to find an intermediate position. We will have to lead or at least become members of a new nonaligned movement, in order to be friends with both parties. But making friends with the two rival parties will require quite a bit of skill and great energy, which we still, unfortunately, do not have.""KazakhstanIndependent political analyst Aydos Sarym:""There are mistaken assumptions among [the Kazakh] authorities that if Obama wins then it will be easier for the Kazakh government and if McCain wins then it will be tough for the Kazakh government. But all of these assumptions are wrong. They are simply mere words. The United States is a country where the government has been implementing a consistent foreign policy, and it does not matter if the Democrats or the Republicans come to power. As far as human rights and democracy are concerned, I think that it would not be easy for our regime in any case.""TajikistanPolitical analyst Abdughaffori Kamol:""For many years, power in the United States has changed between Democrats and Republicans. But except for some domestic economic problems or other domestic problems, in foreign policy they have pursued the same strategy. Two years ago George Bush said that the policies of the United States were determined 25-30 years ago and that the administration is only implementing them. Therefore I don't think that for example Barack Obama will introduce some changes in relations with such a small country as Tajikistan. The current political policy of the United States will be continued [after the presidential election.] ""They could make only very small changes in the field of investment, like to increase or decrease its level, and that's all. But if we take into consideration that Barack Obama supports the policy of increasing the level of troops in Afghanistan with the aim of destroying the nest of terrorism and eradicating drug cultivation in that country, if we look from that point, I think they could give more attention to Tajikistan and the security measures in Afghanistan would be strengthened.""ArmeniaAnalyst Richard Giragosian:""The U.S. presidential election is widely interpreted as a turning point in U.S. foreign policy. This contest, in many ways more than any U.S. election in many years, promises to usher in a significantly new period of challenges and choices for America, no matter who becomes the next U.S. president. After eight years of the Bush administration, the next president faces a difficult inheritance -- a massive deficit, a serious financial crisis, and lingering problems in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Richard Giragosian""In this way, no matter who wins the election, it is clear that the new leader will have to embark on a serious course correction simply to contain the damage already inflicted on U.S. power and credibility. While such a shift in U.S. foreign policy will include a broad reassessment in all areas, U.S. policy regarding the South Caucasus will also need to address the recent reassertion of Russian power and influence, a trend that has only been reinforced by the aftermath of the Georgian conflict this past August. From a narrower perspective, however, the post-Georgia shift in the regional landscape will necessitate a modification of U.S. policy toward Armenia, based on a new recognition that domestic politics and economics matter much more than the grander context of geopolitics. ""And for the incoming U.S. administration, the case of Armenia will pose a new challenge between more aggressively pressuring the embattled Armenian leadership, which is also seriously hobbled by a lack of legitimacy, and the more traditional emphasis on gradual, evolutionary change. Yet the imperative for the United States is to no longer remain silent or timid in the face of unacceptable deficiencies in democracy in countries like Armenia or even Azerbaijan, especially because the real key to lasting stability in these countries lies in holding their leaders more accountable to their own people and to meeting international standards and norms.""UkraineOleh Bilorus, chairman of parliament's Foreign Policy Committee and a former Ambassador to Washington:""We expect that the United States, as a superpower, the global leader, will influence other countries, including those that refrained from supporting a MAP [NATO Membership Action Plan] for Ukraine. There is no doubt that the United States supports Ukraine, but there is Germany, and other countries that have doubts. I think that in December this issue will be reconsidered. After [NATO's April summit in] Bucharest there is no choice but to offer Ukraine a MAP.""

We've already said that by now this conflict is a regional one, it is even a conflict at the crossroads of geopolitical interests.""Oleg Serebria, an opposition leader in parliament:""A victory for Republican McCain will put the countries in our region in a better position because McCain knows very well the problem of the Black Sea region, he has a very well defined and strict position toward Russia and its policy in the Black Sea region and generally in Southeast Europe. I think Obama will have different priorities in foreign policy, Southeast Europe will not be part of it; he already signaled that his policy towards Russia will be more conciliatory and that one of his priorities will be North-South, not East-West, relations; as a consequence our country might be put aside.""",,,

But one of the things that hasn't been resolved is international peacekeepers for the Lachin Corridor, which links Karabakh with Armenia proper,"" Fuller notes. ""What I think, or what I suspect Medvedev might be about to propose to Sarkisian and Aliyev is that these international peacekeepers could be largely or wholly Russian.""Fuller and other analysts say Moscow is keen to maintain influence in Armenia, its main ally in the Caucasus, after Russia's brief war with Western-leaning Georgia in August raised tensions throughout the region. Nagorno-Karabakh has also been the subject of heightened international diplomacy in recent weeks. During a visit to Yerevan on October 17, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said a breakthrough in the 20-year-old conflict was now ""possible.""And in September, Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Armenia. Turkey is a close ally of Azerbaijan, and does not have diplomatic relations with Armenia. Gul's visit sparked speculation that a normalization of relations between Ankara and Yerevan was in the works, and that this in turn could facilitate a resolution on Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic-Armenian forces since a six-year conflict killed about 30,000 people and displaced another million before a truce was reached in 1994.

Speaking on October 21 during a visit to Yerevan, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev argued that one of the lessons to be drawn from the fighting over South Ossetia is that such conflicts can and must be resolved peacefully, through negotiations. To that end, Medvedev offered to host a summit in Moscow early next month between Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and his newly reelected Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev in order to seek a solution to the Karabakh conflict ""based on international principles."" Basic Principles The September visit to Yerevan by Turkish President Abdullah Gul fuelled hopes for a normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia that could in turn facilitate an accord on Karabakh. At the same time, some analysts construed Gul's statement that Ankara is ready to help mediate such a solution as a bid, possibly supported by Russia, to sideline the OSCE's Minsk Group. And some political figures in Yerevan fear that under pressure from both Russia and the West, Sarkisian might agree to compromises they consider unacceptable and detrimental to Armenia's long-term interests. A framework agreement for resolving the Karabakh conflict already exists, in the form of the so-called Madrid Principles presented by the French, U.S., and Russian Minsk Group co-chairmen to the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Madrid in November 2007. That blueprint in turn was based on the so-called Basic Principles for the Peaceful Solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict, which were made public in June 2006. The Basic Principles envisage the phased withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territories contiguous to Nagorno-Karabakh, including the district of Kelbacar and the strategic Lachin corridor that links Armenia and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR); the demilitarization of those previously occupied territories; the deployment of an international peacekeeping force; demining, reconstruction, and other measures to address the impact of the conflict and expedite the return to their homes of displaced persons; and, finally, a referendum among the NKR population to determine the region's future status vis-a-vis the central Azerbaijani government in Baku. Meeting for the first time on the sidelines of a CIS summit in St. Petersburg in June, Sarkisian and Aliyev gave the green light for their respective foreign ministers to continue talks on ways to resolve the conflict on the basis of the Madrid Principles. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who traveled to Yerevan in early October for talks with Sarkisian and Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian, was quoted by ""Rossiiskaya gazeta"" on October 7 as saying that all three co-chairs see ""a very real chance"" of resolving the conflict, assuming that agreement can be reached on the ""two or three"" still unresolved issues. Lavrov added that the main obstacle is lack of consensus on the future of the Lachin corridor. The Azerbaijani website day.az back on April 1 quoted Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov as saying Azerbaijan has no objections to both Armenia and Azerbaijan using the corridor, provided it remains territorially a part of Azerbaijan. Resolution Hopes Visiting Yerevan on October 17, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried was even more upbeat than Lavrov. He told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that a breakthrough in the conflict-resolution process in the coming weeks is ""possible,"" given that ""the war in Georgia reminded everyone in this region how terrible war is"" and thus made a resumption of hostilities less likely. But, Fried went on, ""possible does not mean inevitable, and there are hard decisions that have to be made on both sides. If this conflict were easy to resolve, it would have been resolved already."" Fried did not mention any heightened role for Turkey in the peace process. But meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian (no relation to Serzh) in Washington on October 14, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice discounted speculation that the Minsk Group would be superseded as the mediating body. Speaking to journalists in Yerevan on September 17, French Minsk Group co-Chairman Bernard Fassier similarly sought to dispel the perception that Turkey was seeking to torpedo the work of the Minsk Group. Fassier explained that since Turkey is one of the 12 members of the OSCE Minsk Group, ""its efforts directed at providing assistance to the settlement of the Karabakh conflict do not imply a change in the format of negotiations."" He said that Turkey ""has always shown a constructive approach, supporting the activities of the three co-chairmen,"" and that ""any proposal made to support the negotiations, in particular from Turkey, is desirable and welcome,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported.(Click map to enlarge) Former Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian nonetheless argued at a rally of his supporters in Yerevan on October 17 that the West is trying to squeeze Russia out of the Karabakh peace process as part of a broader effort to minimize Russian influence in the South Caucasus, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Ter-Petrossian accused President Sarkisian (after whom, according to official returns, he polled second in the February 19 presidential ballot) of being ready to ""put Karabakh up for sale"" and renounce Armenia's long-standing political and military alliance with Russia in an effort to legitimize his rule in the eyes of the international community. By doing so, Ter-Petrossian continued, Sarkisian is in effect entrusting the West in general, and Turkey in particular, with achieving a ""unilateral settlement"" of the Karabakh conflict. Even the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), a member of the four-party coalition government, is uneasy at the prospect that, under pressure from the international community, President Sarkisian might make unacceptable concessions over Karabakh. HHD parliament faction secretary Artashes Shahbazian told journalists in Yerevan on October 13 that his party, and Armenian society as a whole, opposes the return to Azerbaijan of the districts currently under the control of Armenian forces, Noyan Tapan reported. Asked on October 20 why the HHD remains in government if it rejects President Sarkisian's Karabakh policy, senior HHD member Kiro Manoyan explained that ""it is the chance to convince our partners and influence them that keeps us in the coalition,"" Noyan Tapan reported. Manoyan added that if the HHD concludes that it no longer wields any influence, it will quit the coalition.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/commentary_Russia_Turkey_Armenia/1331509.html,Forward To The Past Russia Turkey And Armenias Faith ,"October 21, 2008 09:17 GMT",,,"The recent race of strategic realignments reflects a real crisis in the world order and risks triggering a dangerous recurrence of past mistakes. Suffice the testimony of nearly all global and regional actors, which have quickly shifted gears and embarked on a collective reassessment of their respective strategic interests and, to that end, a diversification of policy priorities and political partnerships.It matters little whether this geopolitical scramble was directly triggered by the Russian-Georgian war and the resulting collapse of standing paradigms for the Caucasus, or whether it crowned latently simmering scenarios in the halls of international power. The fact is that the great game -- for strategic resources, control over communications and routes of transit, and long-term leverage -- is on again with renewed vigor, self-serving partisanship, and duplicitous entanglement.One of the hallmarks of this unbrave new world is the apparent reciprocal rediscovery of Russia and Turkey. Whatever its motivations and manifestations, Turkey's play behind the back of its trans-Atlantic bulwark and Russia's dealings at the expense of its ""strategic ally"" Armenia raise the specter of a replay of the events of more than 85 years ago, when Bolshevik Russia and a Kemalist Turkey not content with the legacy of the great Genocide and National Dispossession of 1915 partitioned the Armenian homeland in Molotov-Ribbentrop fashion and to its future detriment.Time To Face UpNagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh, in Armenian) was one of the territorial victims of this 1921 plot of the pariahs, as it was placed under Soviet Azerbaijani suzerainty together with Nakhichevan. That latter province of the historical Armenian patrimony was subsequently cleansed of its majority Armenian population, and then of its Armenian cultural heritage. As recently as December 2005, Azerbaijan (like Armenia, a member of the Council of Europe) completed the total, Taliban-style annihilation of the medieval Armenian cemetery at Jugha that contained thousands of unique cross-stones.Nagorno-Karabakh, by contrast, was able to turn the tide on a past of genocide, dispossession, occupation and partition and defend its identity, integrity, and territory against foreign aggression. In 1991 -- long before Kosovo, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia became buzzwords -- it declared its liberty, decolonization, and sovereignty in compliance with the Montevideo standards of conventional international law and with the Soviet legislation in force at that time. Subsequent international recognition of Kosovo, on the one hand, and the later withholding of such recognition for South Ossetia and Abkhazia, on the other, demonstrate that there exists no real rule of law applied evenly across the board. On the contrary, such decisions are dictated by vital interests that are rationalized by reference to selectively interpreted international legal principles of choice and exclusivist distinctions of fact which, in fact, make no difference.It's time to face up to the farce -- and that goes for Moscow and Ankara too, judging by recent pronouncements by high-level officials. And if the two countries are driven by the desire for a strategic new compact, then at least their partners on the world stage should reshift gears and calibrate their policy alternatives accordingly. Iran, the United States, and its European allies might find here an objective intersection of their concerns.What Is NeededRussia and Turkey must never again find unity of purpose at the expense of Armenia and the Armenian people. The track record of genocide, exile, death camps, and gulags is enough for all eternity.These two important countries, as partners both real and potential, must respect the Armenian nation's tragic history, its sovereign integrity and modern regional role, and Nagorno-Karabakh's lawfully gained freedom and independence.Football diplomacy is fine, but Turkey can rise to the desired new level of global leadership and local legitimacy only by dealing with Armenia from a ""platform"" of good faith and reconciliation through truth; lifting its illegal blockade of the republic and opening the frontier that it unilaterally closed, instead of using it as a bargaining tool; establishing diplomatic relations without preconditions and working through that relationship to build mutual confidence and give resolution to the many watershed issues dividing the two neighbors; accepting and atoning, following the brilliant example of post-World War II Germany, for the first genocide of the 20th century and the national dispossession that attended it; committing to rebuild, restore, and then celebrate the Armenian national heritage, from Mount Ararat and the medieval capital city of Ani to the vast array of churches, monasteries, schools, academies, fortresses, and other cultural treasures of the ancestral Armenian homelands; initiating and bringing to fruition a comprehensive program to guarantee the right of secure voluntary return for the progeny and descendants of the dispossessed to their places and properties of provenance; providing full civil, human, and religious rights to the Armenian community of Turkey, including the total abolition the infamous Article 301, which has served for so long as an instrument of fear, suppression, and even death with regard to those courageous citizens of good conscience who dare to proclaim the historical fact of genocide; and finally, exercising greater circumspection in voicing incongruous and unfounded allegations of ""occupation"" in the context of Nagorno-Karabakh's David-and-Goliath struggle for life and justice, lest someone remind Ankara about more appropriate and more proximate applications of that term.As for Russia, true strategic allies consult honestly with each other and coordinate their policies pursuant to their common interests. They do not address one another by negotiating adverse protocols with third parties behind each other's back; they do not posture against each other in public or in private; and they do not try to intimidate, arm-twist, or otherwise pressure each other via the press clubs and newspapers of the world. Russia, too, must deal with Armenia in good faith, recognizing the full depth and breadth of its national sovereignty and the horizontal nature of their post-Soviet rapport, its right to pursue a balanced, robust, and integral foreign policy, as well as the nonnegotiability -- for any reason, including the sourcing and supervision of Azerbaijani oil -- of Nagorno-Karabakh's liberty, security, and self-determination.The Armenian government, in turn, must of course also shoulder its share of responsibility for creating a region of peace and shared stability, mutual respect and open borders, domestic democracy, and international cooperation. An ancient civilization with a new state, Armenia's national interests can best be served by achieving in short order a republic administered by the rule of law and due process, and an abiding respect for fundamental freedoms, good governance, and fair elections, which, sadly, has not been the case to date.Armenia urgently needs a new understanding with its neighbors that will preclude once and for all its being cast again in the role of either fool or victim.",,,

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, in an exclusive interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service correspondent Ruzanna Stepanian, said that ""there are hard decisions that have to be made on both sides. If this conflict were easy to resolve, it would have been resolved already.""Armenian forces seized control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan, in the early 1990s. The armed conflict claimed an estimated 25,000 lives and forced about 1 million people from their homes.Fried noted that Yerevan and Baku were once close to reaching a peace deal in 2001 when the presidents of both countries held U.S.-mediated talks in Key West. The deal fell through in the following weeks.The United States, France, and Russia have been attempting to negotiate a settlement of the conflict in the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group.SkirmishesThe U.S. diplomat said that despite occasional cross-border skirmishes, the likelihood of a full-blown armed conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has decreased since Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in August over another disputed territory, Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia.""I think that danger, which always exists, has somewhat receded because the war in Georgia reminded everyone in this region how terrible war is. There are some who are always tempted to talk in fiery language. But war is no joke. It's a bad option,"" Fried said. Fried spoke to RFE/RL after holding talks in Yerevan with President Serzh Sarkisian, Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian, and Armenia opposition leaders. The Nagorno-Karabakh issue was high on the agenda. He also urged Armenia's leaders to release opposition members who were arrested following the February presidential election on what Washington considers politically motivated charges.""My message was: It's important to get past this and resolve it. The longer people remain detained, the longer there will be a cloud. There is no way to roll back the tape and make this not happen. But it is important to put an end to the consequences as fairly and as rapidly as possible,"" Fried said.As Fried pointed out, the democratization of Armenia's political system will be a ""slow, incremental process.""He said the Sarkisian administration should nonetheless ""deal with the consequences"" of Armenia's postelection unrest with the kind of ""great leadership and courage"" that it showed in reaching out to Turkey. He was referring to Turkish President Abdullah Gul's visit to Armenia in September at Sarkisian's invitation -- the first visit by a Turkish head of state since Armenia gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.The two countries' differing views over the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire, as well as the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, have been barriers to normal diplomatic relations.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Russian_President_Medvedev_Visits_Armenia/1331270.html,Russian President Visits Armenia ,"October 20, 2008 12:20 GMT",,,"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has begun a two-day official visit to Armenia, his first trip to the small Caucasus state since he became president. The visit can be seen as part of the maneuvering that has followed the August war between Russia and Georgia. Russia seeks to consolidate its position in Armenia to maintain a continuing foothold in former Soviet South Caucasus countries, and to keep open an important trade route to Iran.Yerevan, which has few resources of its own, has for its part little choice but to continue close relations with Moscow, as it is flanked by two hostile neighbors -- powerful Turkey and oil-rich Azerbaijan.Medvedev and his Armenian counterpart, Serzh Sarkisian, will doubtless discuss how the short but fierce conflict between Russia and Georgia could reflect on the long-frozen dispute over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Ethnic-Armenian forces drove out Azerbaijani forces from that territory in the early 1990s, and negotiations to find a solution since then have been fruitless. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, during a visit to Yerevan last week, called for an end to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute ""as soon as possible."" He pointed to the dangers of such frozen conflicts suddenly thawing -- just like the Russian-Georgian war, which erupted over Georgia's Moscow-backed breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.Given Russia's solid backing for Armenia over the years in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, Medvedev's visit to Armenia is likely to raise concerns among neighboring countries.But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov issued some pacifying words this week. Speaking to BBC television, he insisted that Moscow recognizes the territorial integrity of all former Soviet countries. He made no mention of Georgia, where Russia has recognized the two separatist regions as independent states. On the economic front, Medvedev will be seeking to bind Yerevan even closer through increased business ties. Russia is already a top trade partner of Armenia, as well as its leading supplier of arms.Russia also delivers gas and nuclear fuel to Armenia's largest power plant and nuclear power plant, which generate up to 80 percent of electric power in the republic.Russian investment is evident in most sectors of the Armenian economy, from mobile-phone networks to Armenia's railways, which are run by the Russian state railways. There are reportedly some 600 joint ventures registered in Armenia that benefit from Russian capital.Another important economic link between the two countries are the estimated 2 million Armenians who work in Russia and send remittances to their families at home.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/New_Probe_Announced_Into_Armenian_Postelection_Violence_/1330097.html,New Probe Announced Into Armenian Postelection Violence ,"October 15, 2008 13:41 GMT",,Armenia sets up council to investigate post election violence,"In mid-June, under pressure from the international community, the Armenian parliament set up an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 1-2 clashes in Yerevan between supporters of defeated presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian and security forces that resulted in 10 deaths. It was initially envisaged that the commission would present its findings by October 25. On October 13, however, its members formally asked parliament to extend that deadline for two months to enable them to incorporate the findings of a smaller, more independent fact-finding group that is to conduct a parallel investigation.The conduct of an ""independent, transparent, and credible inquiry"" into the postelection violence was one of the key demands addressed to the Armenian authorities by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in a resolution adopted in mid-April. But following a visit to Yerevan in July, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg proposed the creation of the alternative fact-finding group. RFE/RL's Armenian Service on July 16 quoted former Justice Minister David Harutiunian, who heads the Armenian PACE delegation, as explaining that Hammarberg wanted the collection of facts and evidence relating to the violence to be a separate process, entrusted to the new body, while the ad hoc parliamentary commission would merely deliver a ""political evaluation"" based on those findings. Harutiunian said the new body should ""consist exclusively of apolitical experts who enjoy public trust. Experts who would be chosen by all political forces.""The ad hoc commission was initially to include two parliament deputies from each faction and one independent deputy, giving a total of at least eight pro-government lawmakers and two opposition representatives. But on June 19, it decided also to invite to participate in its work all political forces that received at least 3 percent of the popular vote during the May 2007 parliamentary elections but less than the minimum 5 percent needed to win seats in the National Assembly, as well as defeated candidates in the February 19 presidential elections, including Ter-Petrossian, or their representatives.Both Ter-Petrossian and Zharangutiun (Heritage), the sole opposition party represented in parliament, decided against participating in the work of the ad hoc commission, however, arguing that it would not prove capable of delivering an independent and objective assessment of events. On October 2, Zharangutiun faction member Vardan Khachatrian denounced the findings of the ad hoc commission to date as ""a farce"" intended to exonerate the authorities of any responsibility for the deaths and injuries, Noyan Tapan reported.Khachatrian also said on October 2 that Zharangutiun plans to launch an independent probe, with the specific intention of answering the as-yet-open question: who issued the order to security forces to open fire on the protesters? He said Zharangutiun will nominate a representative to the new, smaller body, which will reportedly comprise two representatives each from the government and from the opposition, plus an expert from the office of human rights ombudsman Armen Harutiunian (no relation to David), who incurred criticism from outgoing President Robert Kocharian in April for his trenchant and objective 80-page report on the chain of events that culminated in the March violence. Other opposition parties have not yet commented on the planned new probe.The Armenian authorities have also asked foreign governments and international organizations to nominate representatives to the new fact-finding group, but to date only the United States has done so, dispatching to Yerevan last week three experts who participated in an independent inquiry into the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The three held discussions with members of the ad hoc commission; one of them met on October 7 with Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian, who went on record in March as attributing the violence to Ter-Petrossian's use of mass hypnosis and other ""psychological tricks"" on his supporters.Speaking to journalists on October 13, ad hoc commission member Artashes Shahbazian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun, one of the four parties in the coalition government, appealed to the opposition to provide materials for the ongoing investigation. ""If you have facts that [you think] we are trying to conceal, I ask you to publicize or present them,"" Noyan Tapan quoted him as saying.It is not clear whether the Armenian authorities' delay in setting up the alternative fact-finding group proposed by Hammarberg was the result of inertia or a deliberate attempt to prolong the investigation beyond the original October 25 deadline. But the continued uncertainty benefits the authorities insofar as it provides a pretext for keeping in pretrial detention several prominent Ter-Petrossian associates arrested in the wake of the March violence, including former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzumanian.",,,

Trying to exploit whatever influence it has with Moscow, Brussels' aim is to get the Russian troops to pull back from as much of Georgian territory as possible.The United States, on the other hand, is focusing on the longer-term objective of shoring up the resolve of the governments in the region to stand up to Moscow. It believes Azerbaijan is key to this effort.The EU on October 1 formally launched its 340-strong monitoring mission in Georgia. Armored cars carrying unarmed EU observers set out from their bases with the aim of entering the so-called buffer zone set up by Russian troops outside the administrative borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.In Tbilisi for the inauguration of the monitoring mission, EU foreign-policy chief Javier Solana on September 30 reiterated the bloc's view that Russia has committed itself to withdrawing its troops from the ""buffer zone"" within 10 days of the observers' deployment.""I hope very much that by the end of [October 10] that Russian forces will be withdrawn,"" Solana said. ""That is the aim that we have, and that is, at least for the first part, the obligation that we have from the agreement. And we'd like very much to see that done.""Complications From Both SidesUnfortunately for the EU, its observer mission had trouble gaining access to the areas in Georgian proper that are still controlled by Russian soldiers.Moscow is obliged to cease all military activity outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia under the terms of an agreement it signed with the EU on September 8. That agreement modifies an earlier accord, reached on August 12, which allowed Russia to carry out ""additional security measures"" in Georgia outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia.The August 12 agreement also stipulates that an international conference will be convened in Geneva on October 15 to discuss the ""stability"" and ""security"" of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.Preparations for the conference have been fraught with difficulty. Russia insists on the full presence of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian authorities -- both of which it has recognized as independent countries. Georgia, on the other hand, vehemently rejects any arrangements that could be seen as conferring independent status on either region.As a result, the first talks on October 15 will be low-key, featuring junior ministers from Georgia and Russia as well as mediators from the EU. They will be preceded on October 14 -- also in Geneva -- by a summit of top officials from the United Nations, OSCE, EU, and the United States.President Mikheil Saakashvili indicated last month that Tbilisi is prepared to talk to the separatists about refugees, but not the status of the regions.""The next stage is, and a parallel stage is returning [internally displaced persons] in secure and dignified conditions, getting internationalization of the process -- but not of the status, I have to say the process -- and getting Russians out of Georgia's territory, deoccupation of Georgia, because these are, right now, territories occupied by a foreign military power against the will of the government of a sovereign, independent country,"" Saakashvili said.To complicate matters further, Georgia has launched criminal proceedings against the Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaderships, accusing them of high treason and banditry.Regional Confidence-BuildingWhile the United States has remained on the sidelines in Georgia, Deputy Undersecretary of State John Negroponte's visit to Azerbaijan is the second in recent weeks by a senior U.S. official. In early September, Vice President Dick Cheney was reportedly given a cool reception by Baku, but this appears not to have put off Washington.With considerable gas and oil reserves of its own, Azerbaijan holds the only viable transit route between Central Asia and Europe that bypasses Russia. Without Baku's cooperation, the EU's projected Nabucco pipeline between bringing Caspian hydrocarbons through Turkey to Austria would be doomed -- and Russia's grip on the EU's energy supplies would tighten.Azerbaijan and Armenia have adopted a wait-and-see posture in the aftermath of the Russian tour de force in Georgia in early August.Western diplomats say Azerbaijan's self-confidence, which had been buoyed by the huge windfall profits it was making from oil and gas, has been visibly dented. Along with it were the short-term hopes it may have entertained about retaking Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia by force.Armenia, forced into an uneasy alliance with Russia because of its standoff with Azerbaijan, is now worried it may itself become a target for Moscow. Yerevan has in recent weeks taken steps to break out of the regional isolation it finds itself in. On September 6, Turkish President Abdullah Gul paid a landmark visit to Yerevan. On September 30, Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian arrived in Tbilisi for his first visit to Georgia since the war.Diplomats in the region say Yerevan is pressing Turkey to open up the mutual border, which has been closed since 1993. Western officials say there are rumors that in order to secure a breakthrough in relations with Turkey, Armenia may consider returning to Azerbaijan five of the seven Azerbaijani provinces it currently occupies around Nagorno-Karabakh.Currently, Georgia provides the only overland access route between Armenia and the outside world, and maintaining good relations with Tbilisi remains a must for Yerevan.The delicate interdependence between the three countries will be brought into sharp relief this winter. Like last winter, Georgia will need Azerbaijani gas to survive. Aside from Iran, Armenia can only turn to Georgia in its quest for gas as it lacks a border with Russia and remains on nontrading terms with both Azerbaijan and Turkey.Meanwhile, Russia is actively seeking to reestablish control over the region. Moscow is said to be intent on frustrating any rapprochement between Yerevan and Ankara, and has blocked Armenian attempts to restore a key railway link to Turkey that is owned by a Russian company.Russia is also putting pressure on Baku. Russia has offered to buy all of Azerbaijan's gas and oil exports at world prices. There are also reports that Russian passports are being handed out in Azerbaijan's restive north, bordering Daghestan, which could serve as a warning for Baku and certainly evokes uneasy parallels with the Russian action in the Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in August.",,,
,D,https://www.rferl.org/a/How_Cohesive_Is_The_Armenian_Leadership/1270701.html,How Cohesive Is The Armenian Leadership ,"September 23, 2008 13:11 GMT",,,"Levon Ter-Petrossian addresses a crowd in Yerevan on September 15.Two events over the past three weeks -- the landmark visit to Yerevan on September 6 by Turkish President Abdullah Gul and the resignation on September 19 under pressure of parliament speaker Tigran Torosian -- have again focused attention on possible fissures within Armenia's coalition government.Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian pointed to those perceived disagreements in his address at an opposition rally in Yerevan on September 15. But three days later, National Security Council Secretary Artur Baghdasarian, the chairman of one of the four coalition parties, categorically rejected Ter-Petrossian's allegations, claiming the Armenian government ""has never been so strong and united"" as it is today.Gul's acceptance of the invitation extended by his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian was widely greeted both within Armenia and abroad as paving the way for a gradual normalization of relations, meaning opening the border between the two countries and establishing formal diplomatic ties.But the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), which is ambivalent about the clause in the Armenian Constitution adopted in summer 1995 abjuring any territorial claims on present-day Turkey, was less enthusiastic. Several hundred of its members staged protests during Gul's visit, and the party subsequently issued a statement advocating caution.Specifically, the statement stressed the need for Turkey and the international community to acknowledge formally as genocide the killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as a ""first step"" toward rapprochement; warned against any concessions to Turkey that could weaken ""Armenia's sovereignty, the viability of its existence, or the national and state rights of future generations""; and argued that Turkey must not be allowed to dictate to Armenia conditions for resolving the Karabakh conflict, or seek to ""deepen divisions within the South Caucasus.""'Too Passive'Leading HHD member Vahan Hovannisian explained the party's position to journalists on September 18, criticizing Armenian diplomacy vis-a-vis Turkey as ""too passive,"" and complaining that Turkey is reaping greater benefits from Sarkisian's overture than Armenia is, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported.At the same time, Hovannisian downplayed the diverging views between the HHD and its coalition partners and effectively gave his party's blessing to the decision by Sarkisian's Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) to oust parliament speaker Torosian. Noting that the constitutional amendments adopted in a referendum in November 2005 enhanced the role of the parliament in political life, Hovannisian argued that in order to capitalize on its increased powers the legislature needs ""a decisive and courageous chairman.""Commenting one week earlier on the rumors of Torosian's impending resignation, HHK Deputy Chairman Razmik Zohrabian similarly argued that ""a strong person should lead the strong; it never happens that a ram leads an army of lions,"" Noyan Tapan reported on September 10. Zohrabian did not explain why, if it considered him insufficiently bold and decisive, the HHK selected Torosian as parliament speaker in the first place.Some observers may take issue with that implicit criticism of Torosian, who has sought doggedly since he was named parliament chairman in June 2007 to strengthen the parliament as an institution. Rumors first emerged in June that the HHK was seeking to replace Torosian with Hovik Abrahamian, who served under President Sarkisian's predecessor, Robert Kocharian, as deputy prime minister and was named in April to head Sarkisian's presidential staff.Those rumors suggested that the rationale for installing Abrahamian as speaker was to pave the way for Kocharian's appointment as prime minister. Abrahamian, who was elected to parliament just four weeks ago in a constituency previously held by his brother Henrik, is widely perceived to have profited from his closeness to Kocharian in order to acquire ""for pennies"" several wineries and other enterprises. The daily ""Chorrord ishkhanutiun"" on September 17 published a list of what it claimed are Abrahamian's total assets. They also reportedly include all intercity transport routes and two apartment buildings in central Yerevan.Tigran Torosian'Intrigues And Conspiracies'Having warned in June that he did not intend to step down voluntarily, Torosian finally capitulated on September 16. He told journalists that ""for three or four months everything was being done by means of intrigues and conspiracies behind the scene [to force me to step down]. I would advise certain people to take their 30 pieces of silver and continue on their way.""Citing ""irreconcilable differences with the parliament majority on a number of issues concerning the country's domestic political life,"" Torosian said he had submitted his resignation from the HHK, but intended to retain his parliament mandate as an independent deputy. He formally resigned as parliament speaker on September 19.In an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Zohrabian denied the existence of any ""irreconcilable differences"" between Torosian and the HHK leadership. Zohrabian also said Torosian was offered various government or diplomatic posts in exchange for his resignation as speaker, including that of minister for the diaspora.The HHK has formally proposed Abrahamian to succeed Torosian as speaker, but the parliament has not yet voted on his candidacy. Nor, according to ""Hraparak"" on September 20, has Abrahamian yet attended a parliament session. ""They say he wants to enter the National Assembly as parliament speaker and does not want to take the seat of a rank-and-file deputy,"" the paper commented.Torosian's replacement was adduced on September 15 by former President Ter-Petrossian as evidence of growing cracks within the ""pyramid of power"" as a result of what Ter-Petrossian termed ""the redistribution of administrative resources and influence, as well as property and wealth."" Addressing a rally in Yerevan attended by thousands of his supporters, Ter-Petrossian contrasted Abrahamian unfavorably with Torosian: ""Tigran Torosian is not a child of the criminal world, and by appointing Hovik Abrahamian they have finally criminalized the parliament,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service quoted him as saying.Rumors And OpinionsTer-Petrossian also focused on the differences he said exist between Sarkisian and Kocharian. He claimed that rumors about Kocharian's plans to return active politics by becoming prime minister are fueled by Kocharian's close associates and are directed against Sarkisian.""The opinion is being disseminated that Serzh Sarkisian is unable to restrain the popular opposition movement, that he will lose power soon, and that the whole underworld will lose everything. They say Robert Kocharian is the only salvation for these people who own huge riches,"" Ter-Petrossian said. Sarkisian, in turn, is aware that he stands to be stripped of real power and reduced to a figurehead if he does name Kocharian prime minister, according to Ter-Petrossian.Ter-Petrossian cited the HHD's opposition to Gul's visit to Yerevan as a further sign of weakness and indecision on Sarkisian's part, arguing that Sarkisian's failure to expel the HHD from the governing coalition testifies to his inability to control the current situation.We don't think we can simply demand and he will resign. Nobody resigns in that way.Whether the broad opposition movement that Ter-Petrossian heads could profit from the perceived friction within the country's leadership remains doubtful, however. True, Ter-Petrossian's close aide Levon Zurabian told journalists on September 11 that ""tens of thousands"" of people are flocking to join the umbrella Armenian National Congress (HAK) inaugurated by Ter-Petrossian early last month, and which has opened local offices in each of Yerevan's electoral districts and in Armenia's 10 provinces. But at a press conference on September 2, Ter-Petrossian sounded a cautious note, making clear that he will not seek to stage the kind of ""color revolution"" that toppled the ruling regimes in Georgia and Ukraine. He implied that the opposition is preparing for a more prolonged and ""civilized"" struggle.""For me, the main slogan or the essence of our activity is the strengthening of the movement, the development of the congress, which will automatically lead to regime change and Serzh Sarkisian's resignation, he said. ""We don't think we can simply demand and he will resign. Nobody resigns in that way.""Tide Of ConfrontationThe biggest challenge Ter-Petrossian faces is to sustain, if not build upon the popular support he mustered during the February presidential ballot (in which according to official returns he placed second to Sarkisian with 21.5 percent of the vote) over the next 2 1/2 years until the parliamentary elections due in 2011.Writing on September 19 in ""Hayots ashkhar,"" political analyst Aleksandr Iskanderian predicted that ""if the opposition fails to create a powerful tide of confrontation, and that does not seem likely, then everything will be as it always is in such cases: there will be groups of people who criticize the authorities, unite in one common network, continue to oppose the regime, but their potential will not be sufficient to stage a revolution.... Moreover, their numbers will keep dwindling and they will not be able to accomplish any more than they have managed to do so far.""And as former Yerevan Mayor Albert Bazeyan pointed out in an interview published on September 19 in the opposition daily ""Aravot,"" even if the standoff between Sarkisian and Kocharian precipitates a pre-term presidential election, ""there is no guarantee"" that the ballot will be fair.",,,0

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Lousy_Timing_Turkey_Caucasus_Solution/1199495.html,Lousy Timing Could Overshadow Turkeys Logical Caucasus Solution ,"September 12, 2008 11:18 GMT",,,"Within days of the start of full-scale hostilities last month between Georgia and Russia, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan floated the idea of a Caucasus stability pact modeled on a 1999 Balkan agreement. But the diverging geopolitical and economic interests of the proposed five members and the ambiguous status of Georgia's breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia constitute seemingly insurmountable obstacles to such an alliance.As outlined by Erdogan, the proposed Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact would bring together Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and Turkey. His stated intention of discussing the initiative with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon suggests that he envisaged the UN assuming the role of ""patron"" in the same way as the European Union did for the 1999 Balkan Stability Pact, which came in the wake of the Kosovo conflict. Turkish President Abdullah Gul endorsed Erdogan's proposal one day later, on August 12, saying the Caucasus pact would be ""important for stability in the region"" and could encompass a mechanism for addressing and resolving problems, presumably before they escalated into violence.There are, however, several fundamental differences between the Balkans in 1999 and the South Caucasus in 2008. In 1999, the countries of Southeastern Europe, including the Yugoslav successor states, had a shared interest in integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Furthering such integration was one of the primary objectives of the Balkan Stability Pact, together with preventing further conflicts in the region; fostering peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and economic prosperity; and stimulating regional cooperation. In other words, membership of the Balkan Stability Pact was intended as a win-win situation for all former adversaries. Shared Objectives?By contrast, the five proposed members of the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact have no shared objective or vision that would serve as an incentive for setting aside their differences. On the contrary, in some cases, such as the deadlock between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, their most important policy objectives diverge or even collide, to the point that reconciling them is seen as a zero-sum game.Even prior to the August war, Georgia considered Russia the primary threat to its stability. Now, having quit the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and severed diplomatic relations with Russia, it would almost certainly make any cooperation, whether bilateral or multilateral, contingent on Moscow retracting its formal recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, which Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ruled out doing. Russia, for its part, has no obvious interest in promoting any regional cooperation that would strengthen Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia economically. Only Turkey would stand to benefit immediately from a mechanism that would, among other things, safeguard the export pipelines that bring Caspian oil and gas to Turkey via Azerbaijan and Georgia. That traffic was temporarily halted at the height of the August hostilities between Georgia and Russia. Two further factors cast serious doubts over the viability of the Turkish proposal. The first is the Karabakh conflict, given that Azerbaijani leaders have for years said that including Armenia in any regional cooperation projects (such as the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway that is currently under construction) is contingent on resolving that conflict on Baku's terms. In fact, it was the Karabakh conflict that then-Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliyev adduced as the main obstacle to a regional stability pact when then-Turkish President Suleiman Demirel and his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze first floated the idea in January 2000. The second factor is the exclusion of Iran, which aspires to the role of a regional player. Addressing the Georgian parliament in March 2000, then-Armenian President Robert Kocharian advocated structuring the proposed pact on the formula 3+3+2, meaning that Ruusia, Turkey, and Iran as the countries bordering on the three South Caucasus states should serve as ""guarantors"" of the pact, and the EU and the United States as its ""sponsors.""The Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies unveiled in June 2000 a detailed ""consultative document"" that examined in detail the optimum composition of a Caucasus Stability Pact, what issues it should address, and how it might function. The preface denies that it is modeled on the Balkan Stability Pact, but at the same time notes the similarities (and differences) that then existed between the two regions. The document postulated six chapters, three focusing on relations among the South Caucasus states, including conflict resolution and prevention and establishing a regional-security system; and three focusing on broader regional cooperation that would draw in Russia and the Black Sea and Caspian regions. It did not rule out the inclusion of Iran in a Caucasus Contact Group that would discuss implementation of that proposed agenda, and it took as a given the involvement of such international organizations as the UN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).Window Of OpportunityAlthough eminently rational and stuffed with innovative ideas (such as the introduction of South Caucasus Community passports), the working document was not unequivocally endorsed by any of the proposed beneficiaries, although Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba told the co-authors in August 2000 that Abkhazia would like to participate ""on equal terms"" with the other eight players. Iran for its part rejected the inclusion of the EU and the United States, arguing for the formula 3+3, meaning Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia plus Russia, Turkey, and Iran. With hindsight, the window of opportunity for formalizing such a Caucasus Pact began to swing shut in the summer of 2004, when Georgia launched its first abortive effort to bring South Ossetia back under its control by military force. That closure could possibly have been reversed but for the confrontational policies and brinkmanship espoused by the Georgian leadership vis-a-vis Moscow, the unwillingness of both Armenia and Azerbaijan to make the concessions needed for an equitable solution to the Karabakh conflict, and the protracted standoff between the United States and Iran.Meanwhile, the geopolitical balance has changed dramatically since Erdogan resurrected the idea of a Caucasus Stability Pact one month ago. Russia has formally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and is moving to cement closer military ties with both entities. It could therefore insist on their inclusion in any regional forum. President Gul has paid a landmark visit to Yerevan, thereby paving the way for intensive discussions on the terms for establishing formal diplomatic relations with Armenia. In response both to that anticipated rapprochement and to the chaos unleashed by Georgia's strategic miscalculation in precipitating a war with Russia, Azerbaijan is now tilting away from the West and toward Moscow.This growing mistrust and incipient polarization suggest that at least in the immediate future, the sole avenue for cooperation among the countries of the region will be bilateral agreements. (Armenia and Turkey signed such an agreement on energy supplies during Gul's September 6 visit to Yerevan.) In the longer term, Dimitrios Triantophyllou of the International Center for Black Sea Studies was quoted by the ""Turkish Daily News"" on August 29 as suggesting the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization -- of which the three South Caucasus states, Turkey, and Russia are all members -- could conceivably ""lay the groundwork, open channels of communication, and provide the infrastructure"" within which diplomats from the five countries could address the political differences between them.",,,

""It is necessary to better assess the new opportunity, not to allow frozen conflicts to continue but to solve them.""'Increasing Hope'Turkey closed its border with Armenia in protest at Yerevan's backing for the Karabakh separatists, deepening a century-old rift over the question of whether ethnic Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I were victims of systematic genocide.A solution to the Karabakh dispute is seen as crucial to any move to establish diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia.A breakthrough could have huge significance for Turkey's role as a regional power, for energy flows from the Caspian Sea, and for Western influence in the South Caucasus region.Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on September 10 that he was planning a meeting with his Armenian and Azerbaijani counterparts this month at the United Nations.Azerbaijan's leader said he was ""looking to the future with increasing hope.""""I'd like to believe that thanks to the efforts of Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, as well as other countries, we will secure peace in the region,"" Aliyev said.",,,

Torosian has sought doggedly over the past two years to strengthen the parliament as an institution. Elevating Abrahamian, who was elected to the present parliament only three weeks ago and has little relevant experience, to the post of speaker would call into question Armenia's commitment -- already damaged by the March 1-2 post-presidential-election crackdown -- to European democratic values.Meeting on September 6, the executive body of the HHK, which controls 65 of the 131 parliament mandates, concluded that it is ""inexpedient"" for Torosian to continue to occupy the post of parliament speaker that he has held since the dismissal of Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based State) party Chairman Artur Baghdasarian in June 2006, Noyan Tapan reported on September 8. On September 9, HHK Deputy Chairman Razmik Zohrabian warned that Torosian will face a vote of no confidence by fellow lawmakers unless he bows to the board's decision and steps down, which he has previously stated he would not do.Also on September 6, the HHK board named Abrahamian as its preferred candidate to succeed Torosian as speaker. Abrahamian was elected to parliament on August 24 in a by-election in a single-mandate constituency in southern Armenia that has long been widely regarded as part of the Abrahamian family's personal fiefdom. That seat was obligingly vacated by Abrahamian's brother Henrik. Hovik Abrahamian, 50, was first elected to parliament in 1995. From 1996-98 he was mayor of the town of Artashat and from 1998-2000, governor of the eponymous province. During Kocharian's 10-year tenure as president, Abrahamian served from 2001-08 as the minister responsible for local government (the name of that ministry was changed several times over that period). In April 2005, he was named a member of the presidential Security Council, and in June 2007 he was simultaneously appointed a deputy prime minister. He headed the HHK campaign staff during the parliamentary elections in May 2007, and Sarkisian's campaign staff in the presidential ballot in February 2008. Sarkisian named Abrahamian in April to head his presidential staff, and dismissed him from that post on September 6.Rumors of Torosian's impending removal as parliament speaker in order to free up the position for Abrahamian first surfaced three months ago. At that time, both men rejected them, with Torosian affirming on June 9 that he had no plans to resign and would not accept any alternative position outside parliament. Media reports on September 8 claimed Torosian still refuses to quit voluntarily. Speaking to journalists later that day, however, he was less categorical, saying only that he will make a formal statement after a September 16 session of the HHK's governing council.",,,

The landlocked country will reduce its dependence on Iran and Russia and it can hope to achieve strategic security, after centuries of costly domination by despotic Ottoman rulers and later animosity by Turkish nationalist political forces.Is the ground ready for a continuing rapprochement between the two neighbors? From the Armenian perspective, conditions for a final and lasting peace with Turkey have been gaining momentum since the country became independent in 1991. As long as Armenia was part of the Soviet empire, it was the Armenian diaspora that defined the political discourse and embodied the aspirations of the 8 million Armenians scattered from Los Angeles to the far corners of Russia. But once Armenia became independent, it was only a matter of time before its governments would be seen as the main political and diplomatic representatives of a ""world nation."" In this sense, there are many similarities between Jews/Israel and Armenians/Armenia, as two nations that have been historically scattered throughout the world and only a minority of which lives in the historic homeland.Since 1991, successive Armenian governments very quickly abandoned the diaspora's hard line vis-a-vis Turkey and sought peace and dialogue with Ankara. However, the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan put Turkey in the tough position of having to choose between its ethnic kin and its problematic neighbor. So far, Turkey has chosen the former and has avoided diplomatic relations with Armenia and closed its vital border with its neighbor.But this may gradually change now, although issues remain as complicated as ever. Armenia wants from Turkey a recognition of the genocide that took place during World War I. Without it, no Armenian government can establish truly normal relations with Turkey, just as Israel could have never accepted post-World War II Germany as a friend without German acceptance of responsibility for the Holocaust. However, unlike Israel, Armenians most probably will not ask for the kind of wide-ranging compensation that Germany agreed to. The great majority of Armenians, for example, know very well that any territorial claims on Turkey are not only out of the question but even dangerous for the safe existence of their small country. Perhaps some mutual agreement to protect the Armenian cultural heritage in the former Armenian-inhabited parts of Turkey could serve as a sweetener added to the recognition of the 1915-18 tragedy. It is simply hard to imagine any other concessions from Turkey.Nagorno-Karabakh PuzzleThe other complication is Armenia's dispute with Azerbaijan over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno Karabakh. Without a Turkish-Armenian rapprochement, it hard to see how Armenia and Azerbaijan can solve this issue. At the same time, without a peace agreement for Nagorno-Karabakh, it is hard to see how Turkey and Armenia can solve their historic differences.Geographically caught between Turkey and Azerbaijan, Armenia yearns for strategic security. The roots of the Karabakh war lie in the events of 1915-18. It is the never-ending psychological trauma Armenians feel of impending annihilation at the hands of the Turks that led to the fight against Azerbaijan to secure the existence of their enclave. If Turkey and the Armenians had solved their differences before the last days of the Soviet empire, it is hard to imagine that the issue of Karabakh would have escalated into a bloody, full-scale war.Of course, many at the time believed that the Russians, fearing a complete loss of control over their periphery, somehow encouraged the conflict, based on the dictum of ""divide and rule."" Perhaps so, but Russia's recent actions in Georgia also pose a big question mark as to what Russia will do if Armenia moves ahead to reach a full normalization of relations with Turkey. That would really give Russia cause for concern. Armenia, landlocked and sandwiched between Turkey and Azerbaijan, was ready to be an outpost for postcommunist Russia in the region. But peace with Turkey would fundamentally change the geopolitical reality.In the coming months and years, Russia can still play a lot of cards it has hidden up its sleeve. Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan need all the wisdom, fortitude, and vision they can get to find a three-way formula that would satisfy all three parties and still either circumvent Russia or include it in the deal. After all, Armenia can still host Russian military bases and Azerbaijan can give a large enough piece of the oil and gas pie to its former masters in Moscow.",,,1

The two leaders watched an international soccer match between their national teams and held an extended closed-door session.Armenia and Turkey are divided by the mass killings of Armenians in Turkey during and immediately after World War I, which Armenians call a genocide.They are also at odds over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, which Turkey accuses Armenia of occupying.Gul told RFE/RL that he reaffirmed his support for the peace process between Azerbaijan and Armenia, but said that the Minsk Group, a body created by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to foster a peaceful resolution of the conflict, has ""failed to achieve important results."" ""Now, in the Caucasus, the stones have been moved and we are also making an effort and we are making our move. If the move brings results then we will all be happy,"" Gul said.

But to resolve the problems we have to have discussion and dialogue,"" Gul said.Gul also said that if there is peace and stability in the Caucasus, then all issues related to energy could be resolved automatically.He reaffirmed his support for the Western-backed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the flow of which was disrupted by last month's war between Russia and Georgia.But he also said that Turkey has plans to ""bring Russian gas through Turkish territory to the world market.""

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Turkey_Preconditions_Relations_With_Armenia/1197132.html,Could Turkey Abandon Preconditions For Relations With Armenia ,"September 08, 2008 09:44 GMT",,,"Two months ago, during a summit in Astana on July 7, Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian extended an official invitation to his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul to travel to Yerevan so they could watch together as their national soccer teams played a match. Since then, public opinion in both countries has been divided as to what lay behind the invitation, whether Gul would accept it, and whether he should.There are, of course, many factors hindering the normalization of relations between the two countries. Several external players, in particular Russia, have no interest in the opening of the Armenian-Turkish border, as this could lead to Armenia turning toward the West. Any positive developments in Armenia's relations with Turkey would be painful for Azerbaijan. And within Turkey, the normalization of relations with Armenia is not viewed as an urgent priority.""Armenia's Soccer Defeat Opens Door To Breakthrough In Turkey Relations,"" says Barcin Yinanc of the ""Turkish Daily News""Even before Sarkisian's initiative, Turkey was trying to use its strategic partnership with Georgia and Azerbaijan to broaden its influence in the South Caucasus without regard for its lack of formal relations with Armenia. For that reason, it appeared that Armenia needed a normalization of relations more than Turkey did. It was also clear that Turkey required something more substantial than Sarkisian's proposals to begin normalizing relations, a process that would have to include establishing a joint commission to evaluate historical issues, before it would agree to open the border.Breakthrough MomentThe situation changed radically, however, after Russia launched large-scale military operations against Georgia on August 8, advancing far beyond the South Ossetian conflict zone. In the wake of Gul's visit to Yerevan, it is obvious that it was the crisis in Georgia, which demonstrated the vulnerability of the countries in the region, that was the deciding factor in this breakthrough in bilateral relations. For that reason, all the problems in Armenian-Turkish relations, including the dispute over the recognition of the 1915 genocide of Armenians and the deadlocked conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, have now been relegated to the back burner.Turkey was so concerned by the Russian military intervention in Georgia and by the advance of Russian forces into the southern and western regions of the country that in mid-August it dispatched Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Moscow to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. We can assume that the leaders discussed two issues that are crucial for Turkey. The first was the possibility that Moscow would recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh. Ankara understood very well that Russia would not be content with simply establishing military control over South Ossetia, but would seek to substantiate that military victory by legal measures, such as recognizing South Ossetia as an independent state. Defeat in Yerevan could lead to breakthrough.The second issue was Russia's stance toward the continued functioning of the oil and gas pipelines, and also the highways, that link Azerbaijan and Turkey via Georgia. That issue arose because Russia had engaged in maneuvers in western Georgia to secure control of the ports of Poti and Batumi and the strategic Gori-Poti highway and railway.Without going into detail, we can say that the war led to the disruption of economic ties across the entire South Caucasus region. The ports of Poti and Batumi were bombed, some stretches of the Tbilisi-Batumi railroad were rendered unusable, and widespread damage was inflicted on Georgia's economic and energy infrastructure.Armenia suffered serious economic damage because the territory of Georgia is the lifeline that connects it by trade and economic routes to Russia and Europe. According to Armenian government statistics, during the military phase of the Georgian conflict, Armenia's trade turnover fell by a factor of eight.But Azerbaijan and Turkey also experienced difficulties. Exports via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline were temporarily halted because of the fighting. Almost all energy and transport projects linking Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey were suspended, and today the Georgian economy is on the verge of collapse. In other words, it turns out that limiting its regional cooperation with Georgia and Azerbaijan could not shield Turkey from serious repercussions. A Broken LinkIt used to be difficult to envisage a situation in the South Caucasus in which Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey did not constitute a self-sufficient system. But as soon as the Georgian link in the chain gave way, the entire system began to break down, and it became clear that in this emergency situation, Armenia could be indispensable. In fact, the August events in Georgia have demonstrated just how important it is to have alternative mechanisms for regional cooperation.For example, if Armenia had not been excluded from the oil and gas pipelines built in the South Caucasus -- if even one or two of those pipelines had transited Armenian territory -- then the countries of the region could have exported oil and gas via Armenia even amid the Georgian crisis. Or it would have been possible to compensate at least partially for the disruption in Georgian rail traffic by rerouting trains via the railroad from Kars in eastern Turkey to Giumri in Armenia, and then to Tbilisi.A break in the transport chainIt is of paramount importance that the Turkish leadership, which was the first to realize just how serious the situation was, has come to understand all these problems. We can therefore expect serious and concrete new initiatives from them in the near future -- first and foremost addressing the opening of the Armenian-Turkish border and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations. In that context, it is worth pointing out that Abdullah Gul's visit to Yerevan was primarily political, and the soccer match between the Armenian and Turkish teams was of secondary significance, even though it served as a perfect pretext for the two leaders to meet.It's a shame that the Armenian-Turkish border was not opened even temporarily to allow Turkish soccer fans to travel to the game. But just the fact that a Turkish president has visited Armenia constitutes a serious breakthrough in Armenian-Turkish relations -- not just from a political perspective, but also from a psychological one.Even a few days ago, it would have been difficult to imagine the president of a country hostile to Armenia traveling to Yerevan. There is no doubt that this visit will help to surmount the huge psychological barrier of mutual distrust and tension that exists between the Armenian and Turkish peoples. The visit will also contribute to the creation of a new atmosphere of good neighborly relations.It is likely that the Armenian-Turkish border will be opened in the wake of Gul's visit. This would serve as a major stimulus for more active trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, and for including Armenia in regional transport and energy projects. In the long term, it would contribute to Armenia's reorientation toward the West and integration into the European Union and NATO.Gul's visit will also almost certainly lead to a reexamination of Turkey's relations with Armenia. It is possible that Turkey will very soon abandon its preconditions for normalizing relations. Yerevan has also clearly affirmed its readiness to establish diplomatic ties without preconditions. The situation that has arisen in the South Caucasus requires decisive actions from the leaders of both states.",,,

But what we know for sure from his close advisers is that when he received the news that Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian invited him to Yerevan to watch the match together, his immediate reaction was positive.""Turning down the invitation would have given a negative image of Turkey to the world. It would have created the impression that Turkey is closed to dialogue, against initiatives on human issues,"" a close adviser to Gul says. But in the cost-benefit analysis, it is not the cost of saying no, but rather the benefit of saying yes that determined the final decision. Gul embarked on this historic visit with the clear intention and hope that it would herald a new phase in the bitter relations between two traditional foes.""Could Turkey Abandon Preconditions For Relations With Armenia?"" asks Stepan Grigoryan of the Analytical Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in YerevanThe visit, which was criticized by opposition parties, signals a significant shift in Turkey's policy toward Armenia. The question of whether ethnic Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I were victims of genocide, and the conflict over the Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, poisoned relations from the outset when Armenia declared its independence in 1991. Turkey refused to establish diplomatic ties with Armenia due to its international campaign for the killings to be classified as genocide and closed its border after Armenia occupied parts of neighboring Azerbaijan, Turkey's close ally. With the lack of progress on both issues, Turkey stepped up its isolation policy by excluding Armenia from regional projects such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that transports Azerbaijani oil to Turkey via Georgia. Although Armenia most probably suffered from this exclusion policy, it neither withdrew its claims of genocide nor endorsed a more flexible stance on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting some Turkish decision makers to question the merits of the policy vis-a-vis Armenia and start looking for a way out.But former Armenian President Robert Kocharian's rejection of successive Turkish overtures, such as establishing a commission of historians from both countries to reach consensus on the 1915 killings, meant those who favored a positive engagement with Armenia could not gain the upper hand among policymakers. The debate continues today. Advocates of the isolation policy point to the results of the February 2008 Armenian presidential election. Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, who is known to be more conciliatory on both Turkey and Azerbaijan, made a surprise political comeback and Sarkisian's victory against him was highly contested.The Turkish government was expecting Sarkisian to follow the same line as his predecessor. But it was pleasantly surprised to see a leader more willing to break the deadlock in relations. ""Sarkisian's legitimacy was highly shaky. He read the message coming from the street and endorsed a more conciliatory line with Turkey,"" says a Turkish diplomat. Even before Sarkisian's invitation, the two countries' diplomats started to hold secret negotiations with the aim of normalizing relations. Russia Changes The EquationTo what degree Turkey's policy of isolating Armenia has played a role in the current rapprochement is open to debate, but what it did for sure was to push Armenia into the arms of Russia. Surrounded by two hostile states, it was only natural for Armenia to remain close to Russia.The recent tension between Georgia and Russia changed the balance of forces in the Caucasus and has convinced many that it is time for Ankara and Yerevan to set aside their differences. ""We don't want a polarization between Russia and Armenia on one side, and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia on the other side,"" says an adviser to the government. The Turkish government is quite nervous of the fact that Russia has increased its influence in the region, and a strategy to contain Moscow requires the resolution of the conflicts among Caucasian states.Furthermore, the crisis has revealed yet again the need for alternative energy-export routes. As the route through Georgia will remain vulnerable for some time, Armenia could be an attractive alternative.The recent war between Russia and Georgia highlighted the danger that the ""frozen"" conflicts in the region could again turn violent, raising the risk of instability, but at the same time created an opportunity for new diplomatic efforts to resolve those conflicts, observes Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. The Turkish government's proposal for a new mechanism for resolving those conflicts, the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform, would encompass Turkey, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. But the proposal would have lacked credibility in the absence of a real dialogue between Turkey and Armenia, and hence provided another reason for Gul to go to Yerevan.The Turkish president clearly took a risk. He left Turkey under fierce criticism from the opposition and risked humiliation by demonstrators in Yerevan. But the Armenian government kept its word and the visit, which lasted only a few hours, ended without incident.The statements by both presidents suggest a genuine eagerness on both sides to start a new phase in diplomatic relations. No one is expecting a change in relations overnight. There will be lengthy and complicated discussions over the terms for the normalization of ties. But the difference this time is that Turkey is about to embark on a new policy of positive engagement with Armenia, which in turn must reciprocate with a more conciliatory line. As Gul said following his talks in Yerevan, the visit has broken down a psychological barrier. He might also be right when he said that relations between the two countries will never be the same.The Armenian team lost 2-0 to the Turks. But the historic match may have opened the door to a win-win situation for both countries.",,,

The World Cup 2010 qualifier between Turkey and Armenia has provided a unique opportunity to explore renewed diplomatic ties, but questions over whether the rail route would carry football Turkish fans to the Armenian capital in the days ahead of that match highlighted the dizzying scale of questions that linger between Yerevan and Ankara.There were no official assurances that the Armenian-Turkish border would be opened or even that the rail link would be completed in time for the match. In the end, the Turkish side would be rooted on by the delegation led by President Abdullah Gul, Turkish journalists, and fans from the Armenian side of the border. Turkey shut down the frontier in a show of support for Baku following the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The border's reopening was made conditional on a resolution of the dispute, one of the world's most stubborn frozen conflicts, and on an end to Armenia's efforts to seek international recognition of the mass killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey as genocide.But while little progress on the issue has been made since then, the World Cup qualifier in the Armenian capital could prove to be a difference maker.It has already brought a historic face-to-face meeting between Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and his Turkish counterpart.Hurry Up And WaitEver since the Turkish government closed its border with Armenia in 1993, the village of Akhurik has served as the end of the line for westbound train travel in Armenia. The town's train depot has served as a storage facility housing well-worn train carriages for the past 15 years, with locals waiting anxiously for a resolution of the differences that led to the border closure.Anticipating a thaw in relations, Armenia's railway authorities wasted little time readying for the big match. Without waiting for an official decision on the countries' border status, repairs began last month on a 12-kilometer stretch of rail line connecting Armenia's second-largest city of Gyumri with the eastern Turkish town of Kars.""The plan is to do as much work as possible,"" Gyumri station Deputy Director Valeri Muradian said in the run-up to this weekend's game. ""The main work is being done on replacing old sleepers, restoring communications and electricity supply. In short, all sorts of activities are being carried out.""Work on the exterior of the Akhurian II Station, located between Akhurik and the border, was still being conducted on September 4, when there was still talk of a possible trainload of Turkish soccer fans reaching the match. Russian border guards patrolled the area, which lies within a security zone that requires a special pass to enter. Reconstruction efforts were clearly visible through the fence, and Akhurik villagers were well aware of the activity and its potential implications on their lives.Residents in Akhurik talk about what an open border and restored transportation links with Turkey would mean for them. (With additional reporting from Gala TV) Troubled Times""It will be very good if it opens,"" said one villager. ""We used to work in the past -- 40 families benefited from work related to the railway. Now they sit idle without work or have to choose migrant work in Russia. It will be good when the line is opened."" Residents of the economically depressed village connect their future with the reopening of the Gyumri-Kars road and rail line. ""People will get jobs and there will be trade,"" said another. ""When we were receiving things from Turkey, many people had jobs in our village. They received cattle. There was trade. Some 40-50 guys used to work there from our village. My two brothers worked as drivers there. It will be very good if it is opened, it'll be a very good step."" In 2000, Gyumri Mayor Vardan Ghukasian was part of a delegation that traveled to Kars along the road lying through Akhurik.A memorandum on cooperation between Gyumri and Kars was signed during that visit, but nothing has changed since then. Ghukasian recalled that, at the time, the people of Kars ""wholeheartedly"" wanted the road and rail line reopened, as did Armenians in Gyumri and elsewhere. But policy prevailed. The border was never reopened -- and the road, like the rail line, fell into disrepair.'God Willing...'A local villager said that ""when there was a word about the opening [of the railway] a few people came on SUVs and inspected the road, then drove away."" ""God willing, it will be opened,"" said Mayor Ghukasian, adding that such an event would be good not only for his city and the Armenian people, but also for Turkey and its Kars province.""We are destined to be neighbors whether we want it or not,"" Ghukasian said. ""If they don't want us to be their neighbor or we don't want them to be our neighbor, all the same, it is so. But I know one thing -- one must live in peace with his neighbor.""",,public,1

Gul was invited by Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian to watch an international football match between their national teams, with an extended closed-door session before the two leaders headed across town for the World Cup qualifier.The Turkish team went on to win the match, 2-0. Two deeply felt issues have long separated Armenians and Turks. The first are the mass killings of ethnic Armenians around World War I, which Armenia and some other countries call genocide; anyone referring to them that way in Turkey faces criminal prosecution. The other issue is Armenia's support of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, where Ankara accuses Armenia of occupying part of the territory of one of Turkey's closest allies. Armenia says it is helping its ethnic kinsmen defend themselves.The visit offered the rarest of opportunities for a review of bilateral ties, something that made it more than a symbolic gesture. The two states do not have diplomatic relations.Gul is the first Turkish head of state to visit Armenia since it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. Reuters quoted Gul aboard the plane en route to Armenia as praising Sarkisian for his ""brave"" decision to invite him to the game. Gul was booed and hissed by fans when he entered the stadium for the evening match.Gaining Momentum?The initiative has virtually assured a second landmark event, since at the end of their private meeting, Gul invited Sarkisian to the next match between their national teams in Turkey.Presidents Gul (left) and SarkisianSpeaking at a joint press conference after the talks, Gul said, ""I hope that this visit will create the possibility to improve bilateral relations.""Sarkisian declared that there is now the ""political will to decide the questions between our countries, so that these problems are not passed on to the next generation.""Speaking ahead of his eagerly anticipated arrival in Yerevan, Gul had said he hoped the match would help lift the barriers dividing two people ""who share a common history and will contribute to regional friendship and peace.""RFE/RL Armenian Service correspondent Ruzanna Stepanian said hundreds of supporters of the Armenian Revolution Federation party -- a member of the governing coalition -- greeted Gul's motorcade from Yerevan airport with placards reading ""No to genocide"" and ""Accept the truth."" The party continued its protest with a candlelight vigil near the stadium where the two teams square off, at a memorial to the Armenian victims of the mass killings early last century.A major opposition alliance headed by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrossian endorsed Sarkisian's initiative and chided the Armenian Revolution Federation party's protest as ""illogical,"" given its participation in the government. Ter-Petrossian's bloc postponed a major political rally it had planned for September 5, citing the historic nature of the Turkish visit. Fans of Turkey's national team at Yerevan stadium for a practice before the big gameThe ""Turkish Daily News"" quoted diplomatic sources as saying the agenda of the meeting between Gul and Sarkisian would include bilateral relations and Ankara's proposal to set up a joint committee of historians to study the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire during World War I.Wider GoalsAnalysts say Yerevan's hope is that a thaw would lead to a permanent reopening of the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed for 15 years. Ankara's interest in a detente is seen as part of a larger Turkish strategy of stabilizing relations with its bordering states, including Greece, Syria, Iraq, and now Armenia.""My president's visit to Yerevan...is going to be an important step to open doors for dialogue with Armenia,"" Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told Reuters.The overture came quickly on the heels of Russia's cross-border military operations to back separatists in Georgia and Moscow's subsequent recognition of their independence, a situation that Babacan has described as ""alarming.""Babacan said the war between Russia and Georgia dislodged a series of frozen conflicts in the Caucasus, raising risks of further instability but also creating opportunities for new diplomatic efforts to resolve them.""The current circumstances, we believe, are conducive for such a bold step [as the bilateral visit],"" Babacan said in an interview late on September 5 in Avignon, France, where he was attending a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Babacan said the fighting in neighboring Georgia ""showed we need to come up with a fresh approach to resolution of conflict in the Caucasus.""The minister rejected Turkish opposition criticism of the rapprochement with Armenia, saying it was time for ""more open views.""RFE/RL Armenian Service correspondent Emil Danielyan said full-page advertisements placed by four local companies in many Armenian newspapers on September 6 welcomed the Turkish leader to their country and urged the ""honorable Mr. President Abdullah Gul"" to keep hopes of a diplomatic thaw alive after the football match-up by ""play[ing] beyond 90 minutes.""

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Turkey_Caucasus_Initiative_Obstacles/1196703.html,Turkey Revives Caucasus Initiative But Faces Obstacles ,"September 05, 2008 14:49 GMT",,,"Western governments have deployed considerable diplomatic resources to broker peace between Russia and Georgia since their conflict broke out last month over Georgia's breakaway republics, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.But efforts to pacify the entire South Caucasus, with its complex history and critical role as a trade and energy conduit, have also come from more unexpected quarters -- namely Turkey. At the peak of the Russia-Georgia conflict, on August 13, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan floated plans to create a so-called Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact that would include the three South Caucasus countries plus two regional heavyweights, Turkey and Russia. The idea, in fact, is not new. Former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel suggested creating a pan-South Caucasus grouping in the late 1990s.But the armed conflict in Georgia brought the project back to the fore.""We've been looking for ways to create a more friendly atmosphere in the region since the 1990s,"" says Oktay Aksoy, a researcher with Ankara's Foreign Policy Institute. ""But the latest developments prompted Turkey to think that proposing a kind of platform in which all countries related to the region could participate may give them a chance to smooth out their differences."" Russia, eager to keep the West and NATO at arm's length in the South Caucasus, has thrown its weight behind the regional pact.Speaking during his visit to Turkey this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said such a grouping would help participating states mend fences without other countries ""imposing their own prescriptions.""The three other would-be members -- Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan -- have met the project with more caution. Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili, for one, said her country would not consider joining the group until all Russian forces remaining from the August fighting pull out of Georgia.The proposal also got a cold reception in the United States, a close ally of Turkey, where officials complained they had not been informed in advance and criticized the initiative for failing to include Western nations.High StakesTurkey nonetheless appears determined to go ahead with the project, which it has already discussed in separate talks with Russian, Georgian, and Azerbaijani officials.Ankara has much to gain from the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact.Such an alliance would boost its diplomatic clout in an increasingly strategic part of the world -- giving it a valuable opportunity to stir its long-dormant bid to join the European Union.Reducing tensions in the South Caucasus would, by extension, protect Turkey's vast trade and energy interests in the region.""The Caucasus is an important neighborhood for Turkey,"" notes Aksoy. ""Its stability is necessary, not only because it neighbors Turkey but also because it is a passageway between Turkey and Central Asia. Anything upsetting stability there is a concern for Turkey. It is also a route through which Turkey imports its oil and gas, and it seeks to be a transit route for these resources to Europe.""Turkey is heavily dependent on Russian energy -- 63 percent of the natural gas and 29 percent of the oil that it consumes hail from Russia.Ankara also meets much of its growing energy needs with Azerbaijani oil coming through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline -- currently the only transnational pipeline that transports Caspian oil without crossing Russian territory.The war in Georgia, and the standoff it has sparked between Russia and the West, has set off alarm bells in Ankara. Any military conflict between Western and Russian forces vying for influence in the region would put Turkey in the spotlight as the neighborhood's only NATO country -- a prospect that would wreck its relations with Russia, Turkey's leading trade partner. ""A clash between NATO, [i.e.] the West, and Russia is taking shape in the region,"" Azerbaijani political analyst Rakhim Musabekov tells RFE/RL. ""In this situation, Turkey is on the front line. It will have to be a forefront for the West in its battle against Russia. It will bear the brunt of this and of a possible frontal conflict, with all the losses and the risks it would involve. Turkey is trying to find ways to avoid these scenarios.""Uphill BattleTurkey's Caucasus initiative, however, faces huge diplomatic hurdles before it can get off the ground. Relations between Moscow and Tbilisi are at a historical low after their August war. Armenia and Azerbaijan remain locked in a bitter dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority rebel territory located within Azerbaijan. While Moscow helped the Armenian side in the war that broke out in the enclave in the early 1990s, Turkey has traditionally supported Azerbaijan, with which it shares strong ethnic and religious ties.The BTC pipeline has also angered Russia, which is waging an aggressive campaign to gain a grip on Azerbaijan's vast energy resources.Turkey itself has no diplomatic relations with Armenia due to the Nagorno-Karabakh standoff and Yerevan's demands that Turkey recognize as genocide the mass slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915. Turkey strongly denies the genocide accusations and insists both Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks died in the fighting.Last but not least, Ankara is embroiled in a nasty trade dispute with Moscow after allowing two U.S. ships to transit the Bosphorus Strait to provide aid to Georgia following the hostilities with Russia. With so many challenges before it, many believe Turkey's plans to create a South Caucasus alliance is doomed to failure.""Turkey's ambition is understandable. But I think its chances of implementing this idea are extremely small, mainly because it will be impossible in the foreseeable future to reconcile the interests of Georgia and Russia,"" says Musabekov. ""I have equally little hope that Turkey will normalize its relations with Armenia to such an extent that it is able to influence Yerevan and persuade it to adopt a compromise that is acceptable for Azerbaijan.""Ankara would certainly have to tread an even finer line between Russia and the West.Turkey's minority populations from throughout the region also limit its room for diplomatic maneuver.""When looking at the situation in Georgia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Chechnya, and so forth, one has to bear in mind that to some extent these are internal problems for Turkey, because there are immigrants from all these areas of the Caucasus living in Turkey and acting as lobbies,"" says David Barchard, a history professor at Ankara's Bilkent University. ""They're not very visible lobbies -- I don't think you'd read about them in the Turkish papers -- but they are there, both in the parliament and the cabinet. So Turkey will always have to tread something of a delicate line in order to avoid offending these different, and in some cases conflicting, minorities."" Not All So BleakBut there's also cause for optimism about the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact.Turkish President Abdullah Gul is breaking down a historic barrier by accepting Armenia's invitation to attend a football match in Yerevan this weekend, a major diplomatic step that could signal a thaw between the two countries.A statement on the Turkish president's official website said the September 6 match -- in which Armenia and Turkey will vie for qualification for the 2010 World Cup -- will be ""instrumental in removing the barriers blocking rapprochement"" between the two states.Landlocked Armenia, too, is interested in normalizing relations with Ankara. The war in Georgia has disrupted Armenia's oil and grain deliveries, the bulk of which travel by rail from Georgia's Black Sea ports. Reopening its sealed border with Turkey would enable Armenia to diversify its import routes.Such rapprochement is likely to find strong support in Russia, which has heavily invested in Armenia and is eager to use the country as a springboard to expand its markets throughout the region.Barchard believes the pact has the potential to grow into a constructive regional grouping.""There have been some formulas which have been quite successful. One is the Black Sea Economic Cooperation pact, in which Russia plays a full part,"" Barchard says. ""It's not been a very lively organization, it was regarded by some people -- I suspect by the United States -- as fairly moribund, but it has continued to function. So I think there must be some prospect that something of this sort could happen with the [Turkish initiative]. It might actually develop into some kind of watch group specifically on the Caucasus.""Should it fail to ease the region's simmering tensions, however, the proposed grouping could end up being little more than a talk shop -- or what Barchard describes as a ""grand media circus.""",,,

Most commentators for their part focused on the ways in which this one event might herald a new Cold War.But already, those two groups are paying less attention both to the former, given that there does not seem to be any obvious solution, and to the latter, insofar as whatever happens will not be comparable to the military and ideological confrontation between East and West after World War II.Instead, they are considering the myriad ways in which the Georgian events are having an impact on an increasingly large number of more general issues around the world.Of those issues, the following are among the most important.Assumptions ShatteredFirst: the Georgian crisis has shattered many of the assumptions in both East and West about how oil and gas from the Caspian Basin can best be transported to international markets and, as a result, about the relations both between producing and transit countries, and between those two categories and the rest of the world. Both Caspian Basin oil and gas producers and Western powers have wanted oil and gas export pipelines from that region to bypass Russia, but at the same time ruled out Iran as an alternative. Given the continued standoff between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, that left only one route available, Georgia, and Russian actions there have called into question the security of those pipelines.As a result, some Caspian Basin states are now considering exporting their hydrocarbons via Russia even if that gives Moscow leverage over them, while some Western countries that want to punish Russia are discussing allowing exports via Iran, and still others are pushing to resolve the Karabakh crisis in order to allow the export of oil and gas via Armenia. As of now, neither the countries of the region nor any of the major outside powers have reached any final decision, but the mere discussion of these possibilities changes not only the geo-economics of the region but the geopolitics of the world. Such discussion creates the real possibility that old allies may find themselves at odds, while old enemies may start cooperating with each other, possibilities that none of them could have imagined prior to the Georgian crisis.Questions Of National DefenseSecond, Russian intervention has unexpectedly returned questions of national defense to the center of discussions about national security, leading some countries to reassess not only their relationships with neighboring countries, but also their military budgets and their preferred alliances. Even after the end of the Cold War, no country assumed that military power was irrelevant, but few expected that such power would ever be employed against them. Their military establishments were about national pride or about playing a role in peacekeeping operations, rather than about defending their national existence. Russia's actions in Georgia have demolished that self-confident assumption, and now countries are having to decide whether they must reach an accomodation with neighboring states that might be prepared to use force, form alliances that will actually protect them from such armed aggression, or build up their own military establishments either to ensure that they will be able to preserve their independence, or to serve as a trip wire until the international community can respond. These issues were not on the table a month ago; they now are in many countries far from Georgia. Nontraditional ToolsThird, the response of the international community to the Russian-Georgian clash has highlighted the continuing, and perhaps even growing, importance of what might be called nontraditional tools for putting pressure on other countries. If Russia's actions in Georgia called attention to the continuing importance of military factors, the West's response has highlighted the growing importance of other factors, including, but not limited to, capital flows, visa arrangements, and diplomatic activities. Russia has watched its stock market collapse, the ruble decline in value, and capital flow outward at unprecedented rates. It has forfeited the chance for its citizens to secure visa-free travel to European Union countries in the near future, and faces more restrictions elsewhere. And it has experienced a loss of face as a result of the failure of all but outcast states Belarus and Venezuela to follow its lead in recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia; of the West's decision to slow its admission to the World Trade Organization; and of the effective eclipse of the NATO-Russia Council and the G8, which is rapidly reverting to the G7.These things are definitely hurting Russia and will affect its behavior over time. Yet because they are not capable of forcing the Russian leadership to back down immediately, many in the West and some in Moscow dismiss their importance. But in conflicts of interest that involve major powers, such responses are both safer and more important. And over time, they are likely to prove more effective as well.Territorial IntegrityFourth, the events in Georgia have reopened questions about the proper balance between the right of nations to self-determination and the right of states to have their territorial integrity respected by other members of the international community. The international community, in fact, consists first and foremost of states that have a vested interest in the defense of their territorial integrity and that look with suspicion at the widely proclaimed right of nations to self-determination to an extent that may call the former principle into question. Not surprisingly, most of the time, the world comes down on the side of the former and against the latter, but by its actions in Georgia, Moscow has opened the door to more demands based on the latter. It may well come to regret having done so when its own increasingly restive national minorities formulate such demands.Fifth, the events of the last month in Georgia have shattered the self-confident assumptions both in the West, where many policymakers believed that clashes between the major powers were a thing of the past, and in the Russian Federation, where many senior officials thought they could act with impunity because the West could neither unite nor respond to Moscow's actions in the so-called ""Near Abroad."" Twenty years ago, many in the West were prepared to accept the notion that the world had reached ""the end of history,"" with its corollary assumption that the future would be both nonviolent and dull. The intervening years have cast doubt on that for many, but Russia's actions in Georgia have destroyed that view in the minds of almost all.Unlike a generation ago, few now expect the future to be peaceful, while many more expect that the 21st century may turn out to be as violent in its way as was the 20th. That disillusion may, in fact, prove to be the most serious and long-lasting consequence of Moscow's aggression in Georgia.",,,

Most remained mute; the Central Asian states, Kazakhstan in particular, even sought to justify Moscow's actions. That is because, from Moldova to Azerbaijan to Uzbekistan, these ""independent"" states are scared, and justifiably so. Their silence indicates that Russia is surrounded by weak states whose governments are the products of personal alliances, rigged elections, and political coercion, and therefore lack popular legitimacy.When the time came for robust action, the leaders of most of these countries ""chickened out."" It was unthinkable that Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov or Belarus's Alyaksandr Lukashenka, both dictators whose power has nothing to do with the will of the people, would support the democratically elected government of Georgia.What happened to GUAM, the regional security alliance uniting Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova? Today that organization has been reduced to GU, because neither Azerbaijan nor Moldova fulfilled its obligations to protect a fellow member state. Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, despite his country's energy wealth and strategic geopolitical position, said nothing in support of Georgia. He spent the first week of the war in Beijing, and the rest of the time with his head in the proverbial sand, conducting ""ostrich diplomacy."" And what happened to Azerbaijan's ""strategic partnership"" with Georgia? The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) members have many reasons to fear Russia, but the biggest reason is that they are aware how vulnerable they would be should they take a political risk. Regardless of whether or not they approved of President Mikheil Saakashvili's judgment on August 7-8 in precipitating the conflict with Russia, the Georgian people supported him, and continue to support him, because they participated in building Georgian democracy and believe they have a stake in the system. Looking beyond the immediate crisis, Georgians also understand that democracy guarantees them the possibility of changing their leadership should they wish to do so. Leaders who lack this popular legitimacy also lack the popular will to stand up to external aggression, since they don't have a ""contract"" or mutual obligations vis-a-vis the state. Power is not legally theirs: it was inherited, stolen, or bought. And while in Georgia, independence was used to build a state with sovereign, representative institutions, independence in other countries in the region was squandered, exploited by ruling cliques to enrich themselves, while producing none of the human, institutional, or moral capital necessary to defend it.The West came to Georgia's aid because Saakashvili was popularly elected and undertook to enact democratic reforms and take his country into NATO. By contrast, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and the Central Asian states, having failed to embrace reform, can't call upon the West for aid, neither can they look to their own citizens for support in the event of armed aggression. The Russian military intervention in South Ossetia also showed that oil and gas don't guarantee these countries' security; on the contrary, they endanger them, because Russia wants to control all energy resources in its neighborhood and their export. The West should send a message to the countries of the CIS that it will support those leaders who demonstrate their pro-Western orientation by enacting reforms and aspiring to membership in Western alliances. Oil and gas don't give states a carte blanche. For Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbaev, this means that his country's chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010 must be exemplary; for Ilham Aliyev, this means that the West will expect fair and competitive presidential elections in October; for Armenia, this means satisfying benchmarks for good governance to qualify for further Millennium Challenge funds; for Moldova, it means meaningful economic reform. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's visit to the South Caucasus this week is good opportunity to send this message.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Russia_Turns_Up_The_Pressure_On_Turkey_/1195344.html,Russia Turns Up The Pressure On Turkey ,"September 01, 2008 09:33 GMT",,,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is scheduled to arrive in Ankara on September 1, where bilateral discussions will focus on the presence in the Black Sea of U.S. warships transporting humanitarian aid to Georgia. The deputy chief of the Russian armed forces General Staff, Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said last week that according to a 1936 agreement, ships belonging to nonlittoral countries may not remain in the Black Sea for longer than 21 days. Turkish media quoted Nogovitsyn as warning that Russia will wait until that deadline expires, after which it will ""hold Turkey responsible for the situation."" Lavrov will also be talking to the Turks about Ankara's proposed Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Pact that would encompass Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Details of this platform have not been disclosed, but Turkish media quoted government officials as saying that it aims at strengthening peace, stability, mutual respect, and trade in the region. Georgia severed diplomatic relations with Russia on August 29 in the wake of the August 8 incursion of Russian forces into Georgia and the formal recognition by Russia on August 26 of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. Armenian forces still occupy several districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Turkey currently has no diplomatic relations with Armenia. Its preconditions for establishing such ties are a settlement of the Karabakh conflict, the definitive recognition by the Armenian government of the current border between the two countries, and an end to lobbying by Armenia for recognition that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire constituted genocide. Those fundamental differences militate against a formal pact.Living With The BearTurkey heavily depends on Russian gas and trade. Although it was not targeted during the recent hostilities, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that transports Caspian oil to Turkey and Europe is vulnerable to attack, especially in the event that Moscow succeeds in replacing Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili with a leader willing to accommodate Russian interests.Bulent Aliriza of the Washington-based think tank CSIS tells RFE/RL that Turkey, sandwiched between Russia and the West, has no illusions about the immediate success of the Caucasus Pact. The Turkish objective is rather to facilitate talks between the five countries that would reduce tensions and ultimately strengthen stability and support regional relations and trade. Concerned by the increasing Russian influence in the Caucasus and the Black Sea, Turkey is desperately looking for calmer waters. Much like Germany, it cannot afford to take sides with either Georgia or Russia because although Turks traditionally sympathize with Georgia, it needs Russia. On the other hand, despite its strained relations with Armenia, Turkey wants to preach stability, although on its own conditions. Thus, Turkish President Abdullah Gul has not accepted an invitation from his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian to attend a Turkish-Armenian soccer match in Yerevan on September 6. Such soccer diplomacy appears unlikely, even though it would be a nice cosmetic move.Russia and Armenia look favorably on the Turkish proposal. And why shouldn't they? Unconditional normalization of relations would legitimize the status quo. By contrast, Azerbaijan and Georgia have not committed themselves, and have little reason to do so, as talking business as if no territorial disputes existed would cement their losses.A Turkish proverb says, ""Don't name a still unborn baby."" Asked if the proposed Caucasus Stability Pact is such a stillborn infant, Aliriza said, ""that would be going too far. It's about talks, defusing tension, and opening the door to more stability in the region."" In view of the conflicts between the five countries, it would be premature in the case of the Caucasus Stability Pact even to presume a pregnancy, let alone a stillbirth. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin appealed to the European Union on August 29 to act ""independently"" rather than follow the ""foreign-policy interests"" of the United States. That is precisely what Lavrov hopes to achieve during his visit to Turkey: that even if it does not express support for the Russian intervention in Georgia, Ankara should remain ""neutral"" and let Moscow pursue its agenda in the ""Near Abroad."" If the EU is split on this issue, it can be no surprise that Turkey, dependant on Russian gas and desperate for regional stability and trade, is trying not to provoke the neighboring bear that has woken hungry from hibernation.",,,

Yerevan, ArmeniaArriving in Yerevan is a little like arriving in Las Vegas. The terrain, yellow desert and scrubs, is similar to Nevada, and the road from the airport is banked by neon-lit casinos. There is even a smaller version of the Las Vegas cowboy sign whose swinging arm directs gamblers to a particular casino. Like Las Vegas, Armenia's capital city is a tourist resort. During the Soviet period, which ended in September 1991, it was popular with Russian tourists. But since vacation options for Russians were strictly limited, the locals had little incentive to upgrade hotels and other tourist facilities. The town was a pleasant historic backwater. Very historic as it happens. One of its main potential selling points was that Armenia was supposedly the first nation to convert formally to Christianity (in the 4th century.) But that was hardly emphasized under Moscow's rule. In fact, wherever you see an attractive public building such as an opera house -- and Yerevan has quite a number of them -- it is almost certainly erected on the ruins of an Armenian Orthodox church. Today Yerevan is popular with Russian investors and developers. Russian investors own almost the country's entire infrastructure. In Yerevan a massive building boom is in progress. Vast cranes dominate the skyline. (One resident counted 75 from her office terrace.) Accordingly the hotels, restaurants, and bars are all getting a sophisticated facelift. There is still an aroma of the Third World in the dusty side streets. But Yerevan will soon become a real capital city and a universally popular tourist destination -- or, rather, it would do so if it were not located in the southern Caucasus next door to a full-scale international crisis in Georgia.***On the way to lunch I receive a call on my mobile phone from a friend in Oxford. I postpone the conversation, explaining that I am in a taxi in the middle of Yerevan. I get a fine example of British one-upmanship in reply: ""Oh, did the taxi take a wrong turning?"" ***But you can see his point: the southern Caucasus is the Rubik's Cube of international disputes. Every time you try to solve one crisis, you make another worse. Next door to Armenia is oil-rich and Muslim Azerbaijan. Both countries claim the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh which the Soviets assigned to Azerbaijan even though its population was mainly ethnic Armenian. They went to war over it in the late 1980s even though both were constituent-states of the USSR at the time. In 1994, an eventual ceasefire left the Armenians in possession of both Nagorno-Karabakh and some part of Azerbaijan proper. Refugees exist on both sides. Nothing is settled. The dispute is one of those ""frozen conflicts"" that Russia has cleverly exploited to maintain indirect control of its ""near abroad."" Armenia and Azerbaijan are each anxious to keep Russia on its side. Neither likes Russian dominance of the neighborhood; both accept it as a fact of life. But other powerful neighbors also intervene. Sympathetic to Azerbaijan on ethno-religious grounds, Turkey has imposed a blockade on Armenian trade going through its territory. That is a real restraint on Armenia's otherwise very healthy economy --growing in recent years at an average of 13 percent thanks to privatization and other reforms. Still, the Turkish blockade means that a very high proportion of Armenia's trade has to be conveyed by railway through Georgia to the port of Poti on the Black Sea. That railway is now vulnerable to Russian disruption aimed at Georgia -- and Poti is still in Russian military hands. ***""A Graham Greene sort of place"" is how a friend described Yerevan's mixture of exoticism and dustiness to me in advance. I should have thought it rather an Eric Ambler sort of place after the British espionage thriller writer (""The Mask of Dimitrios,"" ""Journey into Fear,"" ""Topkapi"") who specialized in innocents abroad getting drawn into dangerous mysteries against seedily exotic backdrops.Maybe I had these gloomy thoughts, however, because on the day before I left Prague (a different kind of Eric Ambler kind of place) one of my colleagues in Radio Liberty's office in Armenia was beaten up. He was the 16th journalist to be beaten up in Armenia in the last six months or so. No one has yet been arrested for these attacks. Armenia's president made a very strong statement ordering the police to investigate the attack zealously. Since this was a big story in Yerevan, I was interviewed by two woman journalists, one of whom had herself been roughed up, from opposition newspapers. As executive editor of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty I welcomed the president's remarks as a first step towards providing the media with proper protection from political violence and official unconcern. But I couldn't help noticing that my interviewers exchanged skeptical glances. ***Suspicion between the media and the government is only one example of a wider problem. Armenia is an exceptionally divided society and has been since March 1 when police shot demonstrators protesting against abuses in an election in which the ruling party's candidate was elected with an implausible 52 percent majority. Tanks on the streets of Yerevan in March Ten people died, including one policeman and one soldier from the Interior Ministry, more than 100 demonstrators and opposition figures were arrested, and a state of emergency was imposed for a time. This was a shock to an Armenian public that had been assuming that gradual if erratic progress towards real democracy was unstoppable.A coalition of opposition parties has since been holding more or less permanent demonstrations in Yerevan -- demonstrations that are declared illegal but allowed to proceed. At the same time the government has been proceeding too -- with trials of demonstrators. U.S. and European officials and human rights NGOs appeal solemnly for ""dialogue"" between government and opposition. But it's not clear what they would talk about.President Serzh Sarkisian has made some modest conciliatory gestures of talking with the opposition, and the leading opposition figure, Levon Ter-Petrossian, has responded by placing most of the blame for the brutal crackdown on the previous president. But in a struggle for power -- which is what's going on -- there has to be more than that.A Western diplomat suggests over lunch that the president is waiting for a substantial number of demonstrators to be convicted by the courts of using violence. He could then issue an amnesty all round while pointing out that the opposition had been shown to be quite as blameworthy as the government (though he might not phrase it exactly that way.) Reconciliation would then proceed.***That may happen. Sarkisian seems to want something like it. But the real underlying question is: will the tragedy of March 1 push Armenians on both sides of the divide to accept truly fair elections and, just as important, fair campaigns leading up to them. Americans and Europeans are here in droves urging such an outcome (and offering the inducement of greater economic integration with the West as a quid pro quo.) But as my diplomat friend points out, the Russians are also here in force, smoothly asking: ""Why bother with all that pious nonsense? Come over to the dark side. Good money and no questions asked."" Given that Russian influence on Armenia is so strong anyway, it is significant that this appeal is not more effective. Both government and opposition keep talking to their Western interlocutors if not to each other. It is possible that simple admiration for democracy is the reason. One would like to think so. But it is also possible that Armenians, a famously shrewd and even crafty people, have some doubts that their powerful neighbor will ultimately prove to be the winning side, even locally.***When I go down to the Hotel Yerevan's business center to write this diary, my email directs me to a blogging entry by the Hollywood writer-director Rob Long who happens to be an old friend and colleague from the American magazine, ""National Review."" Rob was writing his blog from down the road in Azerbaijan where he was attending a conference. ""Sometimes life is like an Eric Ambler novel,"" he writes, going on to wonder if a recent attack on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (supposedly carried out by the terrorist PKK) may instead have been the work of, well ... what Hollywood and Eric Ambler used to describe as ""a certain power to the east."" Or, since we're in the Caucasus, to the north.""What if a large, powerful state -- a state with huge resources, a history of meddling, fomenting instability, supporting terrorism -- that has been saddled with a sluggish, backward economic system suddenly casts off that system and becomes, instead, a sort of enormous, powerful, ruthless gangster-state? What would it be capable of? How would we stop it?""Not bad questions -- questions also being asked by Armenians and Azerbaijanis as well as by Georgians. Some representatives of the unnameable power to the north were probably attending the same conference as Rob in light disguise. If life can sometimes be like an Eric Ambler novel, what would one of Ambler's cynical spymasters make of these new industrial spies? Indeed, what would they make of Rob himself? Maybe they would mix up the two:""I ran into one of our not-quite-ex-Soviet friends in the bar. You have to wonder what Moscow Circus is thinking about these days. They go to immense trouble to get the clothes, accent, and haircut exactly right -- and then they saddle the poor fellow with a ridiculous cover story. A Hollywood director who talks my ear off about fly fishing! Really! Why not a Highland ghillie who dreams of being a tap-dancer? I bought him a stiff vodka, ignoring his pathetic requests for Scotch, just to show I was onto him.""***Still, an important diplomatic breakthrough occurred while I was in Yerevan. The Turkish-Armenian youth soccer match ended in a 2-1 victory for the Armenians. Significantly, both sides were cheered by the crowd after a good-natured game in the presence of Turkish diplomats. This was considered a good omen for the adult Turkish-Armenian game in September to which President Sarkisian hasPresident Serzh Sarkisian invited his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul. Gul's acceptance is still uncertain, but the Armenian-Turkish railway is being reopened until after the match to allow Turkish fans to attend more easily, and the smart money is betting that the ""soccer summit"" will now take place. If so, that would be merely the start of a long process of negotiations on a range of issues from the Turkish massacres of Armenians in World War I -- were they state-ordered ""genocide"" or something less heinous? -- to the lifting of Turkey's embargo on Armenian trade. But it would be a start that few people expected a month ago. Observers then assumed that Azerbaijan had enough clout with Ankara to head off any such talks. What changed matters is the Russian attack on Georgia. A shiver of instability has run through the Caucasus, and all the major players except Russia are anxious to restore mutual security as best they can. All three countries in the southern Caucasus are nervous about the threat to the oil and gas pipelines posed by ethnic and regional instability. All of them, especially Georgia at present, would like to see Russian dominance diluted by other powers. All now seem more prepared to reduce the level of their local conflicts. Nagorno-Karabakh has been consigned to the ice-box for the moment. Talks between Ankara and Yerevan are on the agenda. But can anything more substantial and positive be done?***Vartan Oskanian was Armenian foreign minister for 10 years until this April. He now heads a think tank, the Civilitas Foundation, in Yerevan. He is one of the few Armenian politicians who exerts moral authority over government and opposition at home and enjoys high repute abroad.In his office overlooking the city he sketches out Caucasian realities. The Russians are dominant, but the Caucasus wants to be part of modern Europe. Their people want prosperity and freedom. For that, however, the Caucasian neighbors need a level of security which NATO cannot provide in the teeth of Russian opposition. So faster integration into the European Union is probably part of the answer. That would be acceptable to the Russians since, being heavily invested in Armenia, they too would gain from closer EU ties. All this would be progress, but not quite enough of it. There has to be a security component in any stable long-term solution. If NATO is not the answer, what is? Turkey has recently woken up from almost a century of sleep on foreign policy. It is now almost hyperactive, sponsoring Syrian-Israeli talks, appointing a dozen or more ambassadors to African countries, and -- most important -- suggesting a new Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform. Oskanian was intrigued by this proposal but also moderately skeptical. Not much that was concrete had been advanced. He wanted to see more details. A few days later in the ""International Herald Tribune"" he embraced it more warmly -- noticing in particular that Turkey's leaders have specifically mentioned including Armenia in such a pact -- and argued that it might ultimately promote a wider U.S.-Europe-Turkish-Russian security guarantee.Other experts are more skeptical of the idea. Zeyno Baran of the Hudson Institute points out that Turkey recently delayed the passage of U.S. ships heading for Georgia through the straits. She fears that the proposed pact would promote a Russo-Turkish alliance in the Caucasus at the expense of NATO, America, and Georgia. Maybe Baran has a good record of foresight in such matters. On the other hand, a Caucasus stability pact would, among other things, dilute Russian influence over the Caucasus by the simple expedient of increasing Turkish influence. It is hard to imagine a Russo-Turkish pact lasting long even if one were to be established. NATO and the United States are for the moment on the back foot in the Caucasus. And something is needed soon to counter and restrain an adventurist, troublemaking, and resentment-driven Russia. Much may depend on the soccer match on September 6 in Yerevan. Perhaps this time the Armenians should plan to lose. ***Tbilisi, GeorgiaSeated in an open-air restaurant overlooking the River Mtkvari, enjoying a light lunch of mountain trout and Georgian salad, one finds it hard to believe that Russian tanks are only about 25 kilometers away -- indeed that they may be even closer by the time the Turkish coffee arrives. Yet Tbilisi has only a few signs of being a capital city at war. National flags hang from many buildings. Newspapers have ironic anti-Russian headlines such as ""Peacekeepers Go Home!!!"" Some pavement satirist has sprayed the features of Vladimir Putin on the pathways so that pedestrians tread on his face. And so on.Posters with a red star and Nazi swastika in front of the Russian Embassy in Tbilisi But there are no bomb shelters. No one looks up anxiously at the sky when a plane is heard. Refugees head into the capital from South Ossetia for help rather than away from it in panic. The city itself is prosperous and modernizing. On its central boulevard the old Institute of Marxism-Leninism is being redeveloped as a Kempinski Hotel. The winding streets and squares of medieval Old Tbilisi are now home to smart restaurants and bars. And these are full of seemingly carefree people enjoying themselves well into the small hours. As for political life the Georgian government is in place and functioning normally. President Mikheil Saakashvili addresses large crowds and hosts distinguished foreign visitors. Its ambassadors launch legal suits against Russia at The Hague. As I walked into a minister's office for an interview, I crossed with a senior official of the European Union emerging from it. There is an eeriness about such normality when only a hour's drive away Russian soldiers are systematically destroying Georgia's military (and some civil) infrastructure, occupying towns and villages, establishing ""buffer zones"" in ""Georgia proper"" to add to their annexation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and arresting Georgian soldiers. ***All in all this is a very postmodern kind of war. The Russians have plainly won the military outcome (though as yet we know little about how the actual battles went, the losses in the air war, and so on.) Equally plainly, however, they are losing the propaganda war. Almost no impartial observer believes their claims of ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" by the Georgians. The figures for the civilian dead and wounded in hospitals and morgues are far below the original Russian allegations of ""thousands"" that served to justify their military intervention. And the Georgian refugees tell horrifying stories in their turn of murders and ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian militias that Russian troops failed to halt. Now, the Russians may be losing the diplomatic and economic wars too.Poland has already signed the U.S. missile defense deal that Putin has been vehemently opposing. NATO has agreed that there cannot be ""business as usual"" as long as Russia occupies Georgia. Western Europeans are becoming nervous about their dependency on Russian energy. China and the Central Asian countries at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit expressed disquiet about the Russian intervention and recognition of the breakaway Georgian provinces. A forthcoming European Union summit will at least discuss sanctions against Russia. And nervous investors took $16 billion out of Russia in the week following its military success. So far these reactions have been mild -- too mild in the opinion of critics such as Charles Krauthammer. All the same they have prevented the Russians marching to Tbilisi and ""suiciding"" Saakashvili. So far.***Georgians are well aware of these postmodern realities. Temur Iakobashvili is their minister for national reintegration -- which surely must be the most optimistic ministerial title in history. But he is bleakly realistic when I interview him for RFE/RL.His first point is a concession -- yes, there was a ""miscalculation"" by Georgians when they launched the attack in early August. But Georgians were not the only people who miscalculated:""When I was at a press conference in Brussels in May of this year and I said we were on the brink of war, I saw a lot of worried faces coming to me and saying: You are using very strong connotation. War is a very, very strong connotation for the European virgin ear.""It is so strong a connotation that the Europeans simply averted their eyes from the gathering storm. But as Trotsky remarked: You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.Now that the war has taken place, it is forcing the Western Europeans to revise all their pre-war assumptions about the role of Russia, the superiority of soft power over hard power, the dominant role of economics in international relations, and much else.Iakobashvili was also realistic about how this postmodern war would be fought: ""I don't see that there is any military component of pressuring Russia, but there is a political component...showing them the political price of not complying with an agreement."" Here the problem is neither military nor economic but psychological: the cultural pessimism and even defeatism of the West. My Hudson Institute colleague, Charles Fairbanks, who lives half the year in Georgia, points out that ""the United States is far more powerful than Russia, which has an economy in the range of South Korea's, and that superiority has multiplied vastly since we strove successfully against the Soviet Union. Only the tunnel vision that comes from immersion in a crisis can conceal this dominant reality.""Georgian officials, Western businessmen, and locally based diplomats feel exactly the same thing, sometimes very impatiently. On my final night in Tbilisi, one Western diplomat outlined the string of financial and economic measures that the West could impose either to alter or frustrate Russian policy. Some positive measures -- aid and investment programs for Georgia -- were already in the pipeline. The eventual package might be so generous that Georgia would be half-integrated into the EU. A prosperous independent Georgia, still outside Russian control despite the war, would significantly weaken Russia's influence throughout the Caucasus. The stakes of this new great game were very high, as an energy company executive said over the same dinner. If the Russians remained in Georgia proper, they would exercise de facto control of all energy pipelines going from Central Asia to Western Europe. If they then forged an alliance with Iran on the Gulf as well, these two anti-Western powers would have a chokehold on Europe's main energy supplies. For the moment, however, the Russians had limited ability to disrupt and were vulnerable to economic and diplomatic penalties. The country was weaker than it looked -- over-dependent on energy prices, needing foreign capital and management skills, facing a demographic crisis that ultimately threatened a shortage of Russians. The West had at its disposal a series of negative incentives -- expulsion from the G8, etc. -- that could be very effective for the immediate future.Both positive and negative incentives, however, required a united West to back them. If Europe and America or different European countries split into different camps, then the Russians could win this postmodern war. And they saw it in such terms. Did the West? *** Outside my hotel in Freedom Square is a tall marble column that used to be the pedestal for a statue of Lenin. It now supports a golden piece of statuary that depicts St. George spearing the dragon. Outside the world of Georgian myth, however, the dragon is still ahead on points.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Georgia_Woes_Ripple_Other_Frozen_Conflicts/1194375.html,Georgia Woes Could Send Ripple Through Other Frozen Conflicts ,"August 27, 2008 15:56 GMT",,Describes the Russia-Georgia conflict and shows how the conflict has greatly impacted the situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan,"Separatist leaders in South Ossetia and Abkhazia had been eagerly awaiting a sign from the Kremlin after the Russian parliament urged President Dmitry Medvedev to recognize Georgia's two separatist regions. They were not disappointed.Medvedev's decision the following day, August 26, to officially recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia marked a major strategic shift for Moscow. Russia has backed both provinces since they broke away from the central Georgian government in the early 1990s. But until this week it had stopped short of recognizing their sovereignty, and had been a nominal participant in international efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement. The move, which followed a large-scale Russian military operation in South Ossetia this month, is sure to have ripple effects on other frozen conflicts areas where Moscow wields considerable influence -- Moldova's Transdniester and Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority territory located within Azerbaijan. Medvedev himself has been quick to draw parallels with the different frozen conflicts simmering in the post-Soviet region. ""Certain recent events have shown how dangerous the conflict potential in some frozen conflicts, as they're commonly called, can be,"" the Russian president told his Moldovan counterpart, Vladimir Voronin, on August 25 in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, in a tacit warning against any attempt by Chisinau to retake its breakaway province by force. ""This became particularly apparent in South Ossetia, where, as a result of aggressive actions -- after Georgia's leadership had basically gone crazy -- all those problems became exacerbated and essentially an armed conflict took place. This is a very serious warning to everybody, and I think we should consider other existing problems in this context now.""The South Ossetian conflict has sparked fears in Moldova that Moscow could now move to recognize the independence of Transdniester, whose separatist leadership has been pushing for integration with Russia. The conflict has given the province new strategic importance, since it borders Ukraine -- which, like Georgia, has angered Moscow by seeking closer ties with the West and the NATO military alliance.Medvedev's decision to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia has certainly raised hopes of independence in Transdniester and radicalized the stance of its separatist leadership, which announced last week it was breaking off all contacts with Moldovan officials until they denounced Georgia's ""aggression"" against South Ossetia.But Grigory Volovoi, who heads a human rights group in Transdniester, says the odds of Russia recognizing Transdniester are low.""Most people in Transdniester think that, since the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was recognized, Transdniester can expect the same. But the situation is completely different,"" Volovoi says. ""Relations between Moldova and Transdniester lack the ethnic element characteristic of the Georgian-South Ossetian-Abkhaz conflict. More importantly, Transdniester doesn't have the trump card that Abkhazia and South Ossetia had -- a common border with the Russian Federation.""Moldova's President Voronin (right) with Medvedev in SochiMedvedev, perhaps eager to repair the diplomatic damage caused by Russia's heavy-handed actions in Georgia, has offered Voronin reassurances that Moscow is still committed to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis. ""I see good prospects of reaching a settlement,"" he said on August 25.Voronin appeared receptive to the message, likening frozen conflicts to dangerous ""volcanoes"" and vowing to prevent a repeat of the violence that rocked South Ossetia.Political analysts say a quick resolution of the conflict is not on the cards. Despite his conciliatory tone and his close ties with Moscow, Moldova's Voronin may be reluctant for now to accept a Russian-brokered deal that grants Transdniester broad autonomy -- a move that could hurt the popularity of him and his Communist Party at home ahead of next year's parliamentary elections.The deal would also allow Transdniester to secede if Moldova chooses to join neighboring EU member Romania in one state.Watching Closely In Baku, YerevanThen there is Nagorno-Karabakh. The disputed territory -- which is home to an Armenian majority but lies within Azerbaijan's borders -- differs from the other frozen conflicts.Unlike South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Transdniester, the population of Nagorno-Karabakh doesn't hold Russian passports and doesn't seek extensive Russian patronage. Rather, its goal is outright independence, or barring that, reintegration with Armenia. Officials in both Azerbaijan and Armenia have been notably muted on Russia's actions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Baku is keen to regain control over the disputed territory and has steadily built up its military in an implicit threat to take the region by force. But Azerbaijani officials have avoided any harsh statements on Russia in recent weeks, perhaps wary of stirring resentment in Moscow. Azerbaijani political commentators and journalists, however, have been much more vocal in denouncing Russia's military operation in Georgia. ""I think Russia is capable of repeating this aggression against Azerbaijan by using the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" says Vefa Quluzade, who served as foreign-policy adviser to former Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev. ""It's Russia that occupies 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory under Armenia's flag, it's Russia that hampers any step toward a resolution. Russia doesn't want this conflict to be settled because it needs this conflict to harass Azerbaijan, to get Azerbaijan back into the Russian empire.""Armenia, which has far stronger ties with Russia, has been slow to take sides in the Russia-Georgia conflict. Military maneuvers in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2005Russia helped Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh war and has a military base in Armenia. Russia's efforts to gain a grip on Azerbaijan's vast energy resources has also served Armenia's interests in Nagorno-Karabakh by blocking a resolution of the conflict in Azerbaijan's favor.On the other hand, the landlocked country depends heavily on neighboring Georgia, through which the bulk of its imports -- including Russian oil -- transits. Setting a collision course with Tbilisi could also prove disastrous for the 450,000 ethnic Armenians currently living in Georgia.Recent events have raised concerns in Armenia that the Russian offensive in South Ossetia could embolden Azerbaijan to launch a similar military operation to seize Nagorno-Karabakh. But Tom de Waal, a London-based Caucasus expert, says Armenians have no reason to worry for now. ""I think it would actually show them how dangerous it would be to start a war in the Caucasus, the amount of destruction that can be caused and how dangerous that could be for Azerbaijan,"" de Waal says. ""I think that would be quite a sobering lesson.""Medvedev's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia is nonetheless bound to affect the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh since Russia, together with the United States and France, co-chairs the Minsk Group, a body created by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to foster a peaceful resolution of the conflict.""It will complicate the Karabakh peace process because of the fact that the Russians and the Americans are two out of three mediators,"" de Waal says of a process that has already been dragged out over more than 15 years. ""Russia and the United States have managed to cooperate quite well in the Minsk Group up until now on Karabakh, but I think the U.S.-Russian relationship is now so bad in the Caucasus that it will be hard for them to trust each other as they have in the past in the Minsk Group.""The World StageRussia's recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions further soured relations with Washington, which has consistently backed Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's drive to bring back South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the fold.U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice branded Moscow's decision ""regrettable,"" saying it violated UN Security Council resolutions.Perhaps one of the greatest casualties of Russia's intervention in Georgia are the international monitoring bodies that until now played a formal role in determining the fates of the region's disputed territories. De Waal says the violent standoff between Russian and Georgian forces over South Ossetia dealt a severe blow to international peace efforts in frozen conflict areas.""It has shown that having monitors on the ground means very little if one of the two sides, or both the sides, want to fight,"" de Waal said. ""The OSCE monitors in South Ossetia were completely irrelevant, just as the UN was in Abkhazia -- when the Abkhaz wanted to retake the Kodori Gorge, they just basically told the United Nations: 'We're going in, and you'd better get out.'""",,,

We're coming back. These last few days were very tense,"" an Armenian man who's been vacationing in Kabuleti tells RFE/RL at the Bavra border crossing. Georgian resorts like Kabuleti and Sarpi have become popular holiday destinations for tens of thousands of Armenians, in large part due to their proximity and affordability. The Armenian man adds that many holiday spots appear to have been deserted after Russian troops entered Georgian territory. ""Everybody is coming back,"" he says, ""Kabuleti is empty now.""The Armenian government's reaction to the conflict in neighboring Georgia has been cautious. In a statement from Yerevan, the Foreign Ministry called on both sides of the conflict to find a peaceful solution. But expert and other responses to RFE/RL in CIS member states suggest public stances that are less cautious than those of their respective governments over the fighting between Russia and Georgia. Whether in Central Asia or among immediate neighbors like Armenia and Azerbaijan, some people blame Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili for provoking Russian military operation in Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia, while others accuse Moscow of using any pretext to destabilize the region.A similar diversity of opinion has appeared among opposition politicians, media and the so-called community of experts. In Armenia, where events have been granted extensive coverage, most of Armenia's state-run media have taken a visibly pro-Russian stance; much of the opposition and some independent publications appear to side with Georgia.Georgia is Armenia's major transport route to the world, with most Armenian goods shipped through Georgian ports.Georgia's other immediate neighbor, Azerbaijan, is similarly concerned about the ongoing crisis. Azerbaijani experts say that if the conflict deepens further, the main challenge for Baku could be a potential refugee crisis. Some 500,000 ethnic Azeris live in Georgia, and hundreds have already sought refuge in Azerbaijan. Experts say more refugees could follow, possibly including ethnic Georgians. That could leave Baku facing a humanitarian crisis.The key for Azerbaijan, experts say, will be to handle any refugee flows in a way that avoids upsetting Moscow. Azerbaijan depends in part on Moscow for exporting oil through Russian pipelines. Moreover, an estimated 2 million Azeris live and work in Russia. ""Now Western countries have to give full support to Georgia and not let Russia change [Georgian President Mikheil] Saakashvili's presidency with a pro-Russian government in Georgia,"" says Vafa Quluzade, an Azerbaijani political analyst and former presidential adviser who blames the fighting on an effort by Moscow to change the government in Tbilisi.Observers in both Armenia and Azerbaijan say the conflict over South Ossetia could affect the region's other ""frozen conflicts,"" such as in the Nagorno Karabakh breakaway region in Azerbaijan. The concern is that the fighting in Georgia could provoke others to seek military solutions to those disputes.Public opinion on the conflict in Georgia appears to be divided in other former Soviet countries, such as the Central Asian republics, where media coverage dominated by state-run outlets has been sparse. A group calling itself the ""Tajik Labor Migrants"" movement in Russia issued a statement supporting Moscow, saying many Tajiks living in Russia are ready ""to go and fight alongside Russian troops"" in South Ossetia ""to defend the people of Ossetia.""But in Kyrgyzstan, political analyst Askar Mambetaliev regards as dangerous the Russian assertion that it sought to protect its citizens in South Ossetia. He says that if Russia used such a pretext to invade one country, it could do it again elsewhere, leading its government to adopt what he calls a ""balancing"" posture. ""What happens if Russians came to our territory with tanks tomorrow, saying that they have their citizens here?"" Mambetaliev says. ""If we just allow Russia to do this -- if we don't adopt our own stance -- then we will lose face in the eyes of the world. They would say, 'Don't ask [the Kyrgyz] their opinion, their stance is known: they would never say a critical word.'""",,,

An RFE/RL correspondent in Armenia's northwestern Shirak region, which borders Georgia, said hundreds of vehicles were lined up waiting to cross into Armenia. The Armenian consul-general in Batumi, Hakob Haji Hakobian, told RFE/RL that the evacuation will continue, as many Armenians fear Russian warplanes could bomb Batumi -- the largest Georgian seaport -- as they have Poti and other Georgian cities. Batumi and Kobuleti have in recent years become one of the most popular destinations for Armenian holidaymakers. On August 9, Russian planes bombed another Georgian seaport, Poti, causing havoc among the civilian population fleeing the town. The Armenian Foreign Ministry warned its citizens the same day not to travel to Georgia. There are still an estimated 3,500 Armenian citizens in Georgia that it plans to evacuate to Armenia. The ministry also said that 850 foreigners, including diplomats stationed in Georgia and their family members, were also evacuated to Armenia. It said 130 Americans and 180 Poles have fled to Armenia and some 130 Italians are expected to arrive in Armenia on August 10.",,,

Some have called on Russian forces to withdraw, saying they support Georgia's right to control its sovereign territory. Speaking from Beijing where he is attending the Olympic Games, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to close ranks and prevent Georgia from taking further military action. At a meeting with Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, on August 8, Putin said that ""an appropriate assessment"" of Georgia's action was needed from the CIS. Nazarbaev criticized Georgia for not raising the alarm before hostilities broke out. ""I think the Georgian leadership has not done the right thing here, by not alerting anyone ahead of time, by not highlighting any rise in tensions. I think, in any case, that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of this issue,"" Nazarbaev said. In Yerevan, Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Gegham Gharibjanian called for a peaceful resolution but did not take a side. ""Armenia is in the region where the conflict is at this moment and there is no doubt it worries us. We really hope that a solution will be found very quickly because at this moment it is true that no solution has been found in the area of security, but I think the problem must unequivocally be resolved by peaceful means,"" Gharibjanian said. The Armenian Foreign Ministry said its embassy in Tbilisi was prepared to assist any Armenian citizen in Georgia who wished to return to their home country. In Belarus, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Vanshyna expressed deep concern over the mounting civilian casualties but, like Armenia, did not align her country with either the Russian-backed separatists or Georgia. Support For GeorgiaAmong those CIS countries speaking out in support of Georgia has been Azerbaijan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Xazar Ibrahim told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service that Georgia has ""every right"" to restore its territorial integrity to South Ossetia. ""Azerbaijan supports Georgia's territorial integrity, and the South Ossetia conflict should be solved only [within] this framework. At the same time, Georgia has [every] right to restore its territorial integrity, provided by the norms and principles of international law, including the UN Charter. And therefore, all the steps taken by Georgia in this direction are in accordance with international law,"" Ibrahim said. Vitalia Pavlicenco, the leader of Moldova's pro-Western, opposition National Liberty Party, told RFE/RL's Moldovan Service that his country must support Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, not Russia. He noted that Moldova is a member of GUAM, the regional organization of ex-Soviet states that also includes Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Iurie Rosca, the vice president of the Moldovan parliament, said Russia's action seemed aimed at Georgia's NATO aspirations. ""These provocations are aimed to destroy Georgia's strategic plans to become a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic alliance in a few years,"" Rosca said. Ukraine's acting foreign minister, Vladimir Handogy, who was meeting with the Russian charge d'affaires in Kyiv on August 8, also expressed his country's support of Georgia's territorial integrity. He said Ukraine is prepared to assist international efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution, and he urged Russia to not become a party to the conflict.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Toward_A_New_Paradigm_For_The_Post_Soviet_Petrostates/1189180.html,Toward A New Paradigm For The PostSoviet Petrostates ,"August 07, 2008 11:29 GMT",,,"Economies and geopolitical clout growing faster than a speeding bullet! Presidents more powerful than a locomotive! Able to ignore demands for political reform at a single bound! Look! On the shores of the Caspian! Nations in transition? Developing countries? No! It's the post-Soviet petrostates!With oil and gas prices at stratospheric highs, these are the new supermen of the international arena, nimbly casting off the drab garb of ""developing,"" ""transiting,"" and ""emerging"" nations to perform astounding feats of outsize influence. Four of them have arisen on the territory that was once the Soviet Union: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. Each reaps a significant portion of GDP from the export of oil and gas, and all pose difficulties for Western nations that wish to woo them for their resources.The competition for those resources is fierce, even as democratic reform in all four countries requires an exceptionally powerful, and perhaps uniquely curved, magnifying glass to be seen. All of this was on display in July, with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev touring Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, while the U.S. Helsinki Commission held hearings on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, wrestling with the vexed issue of resources and reforms.Medvedev's southern jaunt on July 3-6 sought to advance Russian energy policy, which pursues two complementary goals in the former imperial hinterlands: ensuring a steady supply of gas for the Russian pipeline network and torpedoing alternate export routes. The first aim arises because Russia, which makes vast sums from its gas exports to Europe and faces declining yields at its current domestic fields, has chosen in recent years to buy gas from its southern neighbors instead of investing the huge amounts needed to develop new fields at home. The second aim is a natural consequence of Russia's desire to establish and maintain its status as a 21st-century energy superpower.Azerbaijan is unique among the smaller post-Soviet petrostates in that it freed itself from export dependence on Russia in the 1990s with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. In Baku, then, Medvedev pushed a proposal for Russia to buy gas from Azerbaijan, which recently began producing enough of the stuff to stop purchasing it from Russia. If Russia were to begin acquiring Azerbaijani gas, it could boost the gas balance of state-controlled Russian export monopolist Gazprom while at the same time denying potential supplies to the planned Nabucco pipeline, a European project intended to reduce the continent's dependence on Russian gas. The deal would advance both aims of Russian energy policy. For now, Baku is mulling the proposal.In Turkmenistan, which sends the bulk of its gas exports -- some 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year -- north through Russia (a much smaller quantity goes to Iran), Medvedev elicited a rather fuzzy verbal commitment from his Turkmen counterpart, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, to stick to the terms of a 2003 deal between the two countries ""up through 2025,"" the official Turkmen news agency reported on July 4. But that deal was supposed to see Turkmen exports to Russia rise to 60-70 bcm/year by 2009, a provision that seems unlikely to be met given lackluster production increases in Turkmenistan and the construction of a new Chinese-funded pipeline that is set to come online within three years and eventually move 30 bcm/year 7,000 kilometers across Eurasia to China.Presidents Berdymukhammedov (left) and MedvedevTurkmenistan is a small country that gained limited notoriety through the megalomaniacal excesses of former dictator Saparmurat Niyazov, who managed to rename the months of the year after himself and members of his family before his death in December 2006. He was succeeded by Berdymukhammedov, a dentist whose greatest achievement had been presiding as health minister over the apparently near-total destruction of the Turkmen health-care system.Little of this would matter in the international arena if Turkmenistan were not a petrostate, of course, with natural-gas reserves coveted from Brussels to Beijing. Brussels dreams of securing Turkmen gas, shipped across the Caspian to Azerbaijan through a projected undersea pipeline, to lessen Europe's dependence on Russia. Moscow hopes to head this off at the pass and hold on to those same cubic meters. And China is already building its new pipeline from Turkmenistan, with potentially ominous implications for both European and Russian designs.Have Oil, Have InfluenceTurkmenistan is a particularly striking example of how ""petro"" can catapult any state to the front lines of a global struggle for resources. But the same goes for Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia, which owe much of their current prestige and prominence to the sudden wealth and winsomeness only oil and gas seem able to confer. And they are well aware of this power, flexing their newfound muscles at home and abroad in ways that confound, and at times confront, Western interests.In an address to Azerbaijani diplomats in early July, President Ilham Aliyev harshly rejected Western criticism of Azerbaijan's record on human rights and political reforms. ""It is impossible to put pressure on us,"" he said, adding, ""If we didn't react to this or were silent a few years ago, today we are no longer silent."" After blasting ""double standards"" in the Council of Europe, which had warned Azerbaijan a few days earlier of ""serious steps"" in the event of a failure to observe democratization obligations in the country's fall presidential election, Aliyev closed his speech with a sarcastically veiled threat: ""I stress that when we joined international organizations, we assumed obligations and are fulfilling them. If our membership doesn't please someone, let them say so. What will happen if we're not members in some international organization? Will Azerbaijan fail?""Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev was considerably more diplomatic while making a similar point in remarks to the 17th Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) in Astana on June 29. Kazakhstan is slated to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010, a decision that took Western members some time to make in light of Kazakhstan's spotty record on democracy and the OSCE's own past criticism of elections there. Touching on democratization only toward the end of his remarks, Nazarbaev stressed the importance of ""national and cultural specifics"" in reform and insisted that his country will pursue a ""Kazakh path"" to a democratic society.Meanwhile, as Joanna Lillis noted in a July 22 article on eurasianet.org, Nazarbaev's administration has recently presided over an aggressive effort to increase the state's control over the oil industry, feuded with one international consortium over the development terms of the Kashagan oil field, and compelled another to cough up new export duties.Russia Leading The WayRussia, as befits the largest petrostate in the region, has gone the farthest on all fronts. During the eight-year presidency of Vladimir Putin, Moscow made it crystal-clear that it would no longer accept pointers on democracy. The OSCE's decision to cancel monitoring of Russia's 2007 parliamentary elections and 2008 presidential election amid disputes over visas and limitations closed that chapter in Russia's relations with the West.Russia has also muscled its way into energy joint ventures with foreign companies and shut off oil and gas shipments to its neighbors at politically sensitive junctures. Most recently, the British half of the Anglo-Russian joint venture TNK-BP has found itself under attack from a group of four Kremlin-friendly Russian billionaires in a dispute that forced TNK-BP head Robert Dudley, a British national, to flee Moscow for an undisclosed location outside Russia to escape harassment, ""The Times"" reported on July 31. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic saw oil shipments from Russia briefly drop nearly 50 percent after it incurred Moscow's ire by agreeing to host elements of a U.S. missile-defense system, the ""International Herald Tribune"" reported on July 30.Nazarbaev in the Kazakh capitalAgainst this backdrop, the ""2008 Nations in Transit"" report by Freedom House, a U.S.-based NGO, warned that oil and gas profits are fueling an assault on democratic governance in the former Soviet Union. The report noted that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia have slid backward on virtually all democratic indicators since 1999. Turkmenistan failed to make this list only because it had no room left for deterioration on democracy by the end of the 1990s. What's more, Freedom House argued that the resource-hungry West is facilitating the process: ""Energy needs are increasingly distorting relationships between democracies that consume hydrocarbons and the authoritarian states that produce them.""Though this view is hardly conventional wisdom among Western policymakers, who remain eager to gain and maintain access to Eurasia's hydrocarbon wealth, the counterpoint came in a July 1 op-ed in the ""International Herald Tribune"" by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger titled ""Unconventional Wisdom."" Focusing on the largest and most important of the post-Soviet petrostates, Kissinger argued that ""we are witnessing one of the most promising periods in Russian history,"" one rife with opportunities for ""strategic cooperation between the erstwhile Cold War adversaries.""Kissinger made his case using the same material as Freedom House -- governance -- but drawing radically different conclusions. Surveying the recent anointment of Dmitry Medvedev as successor to Vladimir Putin in a process that resembled a palace intrigue more than a democratic transfer of power, Kissinger nonetheless plugged a presidential election that ""marked a transition from a phase of consolidation to a period of modernization."" He then concluded, ""The growing complexity of the Russian economy has generated the need for predictable legal procedures."" A more succinct argument for hydrocarbon-fueled authoritarian modernization is hard to imagine.Pushback Vs. ModernizationThese two views -- let's call them pushback vs. modernization -- were in clear view at recent hearings on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan by the U.S. Helsinki Commission, with testimony by outside experts arguing either that the countries are pushing back harder and harder against demands for reform or that they are modernizing in their own way at their own pace.At the July 22 hearing -- ""Promises to Keep: Kazakhstan's 2010 OSCE Chairmanship"" -- Andrea Berg, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the Kazakh government has made ""almost no concrete progress"" toward implementing reform pledges in connection with its impending chairmanship. At the July 29 hearing -- ""Human Rights and Democratization in Azerbaijan"" -- Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, laid out a detailed, hard-hitting case of ""new wealth"" serving to ""propel and intensify authoritarian practices.""Martha Olcott, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment who is one of Washington's most experienced and respected observers of Kazakh politics, advanced a nuanced version of the modernization thesis on July 22. ""The Kazakhs,"" she said, ""are likely to continue to reform their political system, albeit not necessarily at a pace that we try and set for them."" She concluded that Kazakhstan ""is in a strategic position, has real regional weight, and has a sufficiently diverse as well as wealthy economy to be a donor country in most senses of the term. This kind of country does not take well to lecturing. This leaves us room for attempts at persuasion, but mostly the need to hope they make the right choices on their own.""The same goes for the rest of the post-Soviet petrostates, of course. And what it points to is not a disagreement among experts in Washington, for the testimony cited here differs primarily in emphasis. All of the preceding, from the actions of the petrostates themselves to the statements from their leaders to the attempts of experts to clarify the situation for policymakers, suggests that the dominant Western paradigm for dealing with the post-Soviet world no longer fits the current reality of confidently ascendant petrostates.The Western paradigm is still premised on the assumption that post-Soviet states have both the incentive and the desire to conduct reforms that will aid a transition from the repressive, communist past to a future of democratic politics and free markets. This paradigm underlies institutional architecture, from organizations like the OSCE to democracy-promotion efforts funded by Western governments, and informs policy, which evaluates post-Soviet states on their progress in a transition from the dismal past to the hoped-for future. In this paradigm, authoritarianism is supposed to be a holdover, not an outcome.The problem is that the assumption doesn't hold for post-Soviet petrostates. With boatloads of money pouring in and more money looming on the horizon, what rational incentive is there for a largely unfettered and entrenched ruling elite to fetter its ability to siphon off profits (by advancing the rule of law and making itself accountable) or increase its chances of losing power (by enacting political reforms and holding free and fair elections)? And with democratic societies the highest per capita consumers of energy, what reason is there for policymakers answerable to voters to antagonize energy suppliers in a world of ever-more-frenzied competition for access to oil and gas?None of this is particularly new. Tomas Carothers hailed the ""end of the transition paradigm"" in a January 2002 article for the ""Journal of Democracy."" ""The New York Times"" columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about the ""price of oil and the pace of freedom"" moving in opposite directions in a May/June 2006 piece for ""Foreign Policy"" titled ""The First Law of Petropolitics."" But in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and, most importantly, Russia, these trends are coming together in a way that urgently requires a new paradigm.New RealitiesThat paradigm will emerge from the myriad pushes and pulls of real-life, real-time policymaking, that imperfect amalgam of global trends, domestic politics, and individual interventions. The most an analyst can offer is a guide to the realities we now confront. In the post-Soviet petrostates, they are:The transition from communism is over and it has come to rest on authoritarianism. A rapacious elite sits athwart the flow of petrodollars, controls the political arena, and maintains a veneer of democratic respectability through sham elections that do not offer a real chance for a competitor to come to power. The elite has neither the incentive nor the desire to implement reforms that would threaten its economic interests or political power. Technocratic modernization is possible, but democratization is improbable.The petrostate elites are globally aware and brimming with confidence. They know the kind of rhetoric Western democracies want to hear in public forums, and will provide it ably on occasion. But they are no longer in search of advice, and they will be increasingly vocal about their objections to Western-sponsored change.The era that began with the Helsinki Accords in 1975 is drawing to a close. The Helsinki Accords provided a mechanism for the West to support the demands of dissidents in the Eastern Bloc through a formal framework of compliance with the obligations that states assumed. This era entered its heyday in the 1990s. The comments by Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev quoted above, Russia's rejection of OSCE election monitoring, and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev's insistence on a ""Kazakh path"" to democracy even as his nation prepares to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE all point to its closure. In the new era, the enforcement of compliance with Western-sponsored obligations on democratization and human rights will be a less and less important component of international affairs.These are the factors that will shape a new paradigm for dealing with post-Soviet petrostates. We cannot be sure whether it will emerge, or what it will look like if it does, but if it is to meet the challenges of today's world, it should include the following:An end to the pretense of ""transition."" When Western officials tout the imaginary successes of ""transitions"" that have not, in fact, taken place, the resulting impression of hypocrisy and naivete undermines efforts to promote democracy abroad. The authoritarian leaders of petrostates are increasingly outspoken. Reciprocity is called for.Strong, publicly articulated arguments to explain why democracy is a better system of government than authoritarianism -- because it calls rapacious elites to account, safeguards individual rights, makes real change possible, and ensures an orderly transfer of power. The time when democracy's allure could be assumed has passed. Petrostates are enjoying temporary economic security while their elites are using state-controlled media to present this as the justification for permanent authoritarian rule. An intellectual counterattack is needed.An honest admission of national interest. Western democracies should be clear that they support the spread of democracy not simply out of principle, but also because it advances their national interests -- relations between states founded on common values and the rule of law are stronger and more stable, and business more easily conducted. Western prestige has declined sharply in the post-Soviet world since the heady days of the early 1990s, and arguments premised on altruism will fall on deaf ears.New strategies to promote democracy. Much of the infrastructure that emerged in the 1990s to support reform through international organizations and local NGOs assumed that the post-Soviet powers that be had at least a grudging willingness to change. That condition no longer holds, and the democracy-promotion community will have to engage in wide-ranging reassessments and collective brainstorming to come up with new approaches.Contingency plans for the failure of petro-authoritarianism. Petrostates often fall into so-called robust authoritarianism that can last for decades, but the first law of the authoritarian polity is that it is perfectly stable...until it's not. We will be far better placed to deal with the unpredictable challenges of petro-authoritarianism gone awry if we realize sooner rather than later that while crisis and collapse may seem improbable today, we should never assume that this means they are impossible tomorrow.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/How_Can_the_Human_Rights_Situation_In_Armenia_Be_Improved/1188181.html,How Can The Human Rights Situation In Armenia Be Improved ,"August 03, 2008 14:31 GMT",,,"Two years ago, on February 17, 2006, the Armenian parliament elected me as its first human rights defender, ombudsman, with over 60 percent of the vote. The institution of ombudsman in Armenia is still in the formation stage, due to the unfortunate fact that here -- as in many other former Soviet republics -- neither the government nor the population at large fully acknowledge the crucial role it can and should play in public life. One of the ombudsman's most important duties is to systematically identify and bring to public attention both serious abuses of human rights and instances of maladministration. From the very beginning of my six-year term, I have raised those issues in my annual and ad hoc reports, at interim press conferences, and in specific recommendations to the government. Sometimes the response is constructive cooperation, but on some occasions the authorities disregard my conclusions and recommendations, or create artificial obstacles to implementing my recommendations. Such obstructionism is shortsighted, counterproductive, and risks undermining people's trust in national institutions. At the international level, it can be damaging to Armenia's national interests. Noncompliance by government agencies with my office's recommendations generally results in Armenian citizens taking their cases to the European Court of Human Rights. That court has received about 1,000 complaints against the Republic of Armenia since 2002 and has handed down 16 rulings to date. True, we have made some progress. But I cannot consider the situation satisfactory as long as some government institutions ignore their duty to observe basic human rights. For example, my office receives numerous complaints about the tendency of the Prosecutor-General's Office to insist that suspects be remanded in pretrial custody even when the outcome of their case could not possibly be affected by permitting the accused to remain at liberty pending trial. I have called in my annual reports for 2006 and 2007 and, most recently, at a press conference on July 11, for an end to this unacceptable practice -- which is a leftover from the Soviet criminal justice system -- but without success. Even more serious is the problem of double standards and the selective implementation of justice. An analysis of complaints addressed to my office shows that court officials frequently refrain from using their right to enforce the compulsory penalty prescribed by law when the debtor is a state entity or official. Approximately 80 percent of court rulings in which a city mayor, a regional governor, or a police officer are recognized as debtors are either not enforced at all or are enforced only after a considerable delay. This is a clear violation of the principle of equality before the law. Many officials affirm their commitment to universal values such as freedom, human dignity, and equality, but in practice often flout these values. For that reason it is incumbent on the state to create all the political, social, and legal safeguards needed to guarantee human rights and freedoms in practice. In Armenia, as in many other transition countries, an oligarchic system of governance has taken root that, to a considerable extent, controls the media, political parties, and state institutions. That economic elite then set about trying to supplant the political elite. Business and politics merged into a single corporate group, within which the same persons functioned as both businessmen and politicians or statesmen. Business figures became powerful enough to exert a decisive influence on public policy, either through personal connections or by successfully lobbying their personal interests. At the same time, entities outside those oligarchic groups were effectively deprived of any possibility of engaging in economic activity. This has disproportionately widened the income gap between different segments of society and precluded the formation of a middle class that could become the social basis of state stability. Those negative trends have undermined the key principle of democracy: that there are no rights without responsibilities, and no responsibilities without rights. Today rights are concentrated in the hands of a small group of people, while responsibilities are binding for the majority of society. I believe that the recent developments in Armenia -- specifically the crackdown that followed the February 19 presidential election -- were conditioned by the harsh governing system; the overcentralization of power; an artificial system of checks and balances; social and economic polarization; the fusion of business with government; the absence of any public control over the authorities; and a deficiency of civil liberties. All this has resulted in the estrangement of one large part of society from the government, and its total lack of trust in public institutions, electoral mechanisms, the judicial system, and the media. It is a regrettable fact that in the Republic of Armenia, as in the majority of transition countries, domestic stability is usually achieved through the dominance of one institution of power, such as the presidency, rather than a system of checks and balances between the three branches of power. Today, Armenian society faces a choice: to develop by strengthening democratic values and institutions or to reinforce authoritarian trends in power, thereby widening even further the gap between the authorities and the majority of society. Reporting to parliament three months ago on the combination of circumstances that led to the violent clashes in Yerevan on March 1-2 between police and protesters, I argued that, at a minimum, we need to create a framework in which government officials can be held publicly accountable, and in which a strong opposition can function freely without taking to the streets; reform election legislation; guarantee the pluralism and impartiality of the electronic media; and eliminate economic monopolies as a first step towards dismantling the oligarchic system of government. Doing so would reduce the current polarization of society that constitutes a breeding ground for political extremism. There can be no half-measures. At this juncture, to imitate reforms would be both pointless and dangerous.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenian_Presidents_100_Days_Of_Progress/1187806.html,Armenian Presidents 100 Days Of Progress ,"August 01, 2008 12:02 GMT",,,"Serzh Sarkisian's first 100 days as president of Armenia can be summed up in the single phrase: the launch by a decisive statesman of a policy that inspires hope. Of course, 100 days is too short a period to solve the numerous problems which the country faces, problems which require long-term and consistent work. But it is long enough to outline to both the political elite and society at large the optimum path of development, given that there is no alternative to democracy in Armenia.At his swearing-in ceremony on April 9, President Sarkisian declared the need to tackle Armenia's problems, and he has already set about doing so. He has stressed the need for transparency in internal policy, and for effective measures to target corruption. He has tried, not only in his public pronouncements but also through the work of his team, to gradually create an atmosphere of trust and justice. Some legislative restrictions on public meetings, marches, and rallies have been lifted. A new parliamentary commission has been formed to investigate the violent clashes between police and demonstrators in Yerevan on March 1. Opposition politicians now appear more frequently on television. Tax and customs bodies have begun working more openly.These measures are not purely cosmetic: the Armenian authorities are not trying simply to create a good impression. These 100 days showed that the Armenian authorities understand better than anybody else the problems our country faces, and that those problems have given rise to popular discontent. The Armenian government has enough willpower to implement radical changes in order to create a developed and democratic Armenia. Armenian society has emerged from the postelection period. What is needed now is for the authorities and the opposition to join forces and combine their efforts. We need a strong Armenia, and not violent social upheaval.President Sarkisian has affirmed that none of those arrested in connection with the March 1 violence should be sentenced simply for their political views. He appealed to the courts to be impartial and to differentiate clearly between serious criminals and those who have committed only minor infractions. The fact that many people taken into custody in the wake of the violence have been discharged and others released on bail speaks for itself. The authorities have rejected political repression in favor of developing democracy step by step.In line with his election manifesto, Sarkisian has shown himself equally decisive and consistent in the realm of foreign policy. He has abandoned the passive, reactive foreign policy of the past decade for one that is proactive. Vivid proof of this was his invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to attend the soccer match between the Turkish and Armenian national teams in Yerevan on September 6, an initiative that demonstrates the readiness of the Republic of Armenia to establish diplomatic relations with Ankara. Sarkisian's political evolution has led him to understand that there can no longer be closed borders. Nearly two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, building new walls will benefit no one.Many people evaluate Sarkisian's most recent steps toward democracy as undertaken only under pressure in response to two successive Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe resolutions condemning the Armenian authorities' response to the Yerevan violence. But I must stress that the aim of the Armenian leadership is to develop the country by implementing Sarkisian's preelection program. It is equally important to remember that even the most democratic states would need a long time to come to terms with the kind of tragedy we experienced on March 1. Personally, I would be very happy if the radical opposition opted for constructive cooperation and dialogue, but unfortunately, they show no signs of doing so. They have not delegated a representative to participate in the work of the ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the March 1 violence, arguing that it is incapable of delivering an impartial assessment. Zharangutiun (Heritage), the only opposition party represented in parliament, has declined the offer to chair one of parliament's standing committees. But the Armenian leadership cannot achieve democracy and progress on its own: it takes two hands to applaud. Democracy must strengthen its positions in the field of law, by respecting the constitution. In every country, the constitution serves to reconcile the need to protect the basic freedoms of the individual with the need to maintain law and order. It means wherever one person's freedom ends, a second person's rights begin. All members of society ought to accept those inherent restrictions. It is not fortuitous that the president has repeatedly appealed for a dialogue between the authorities and society.During the first 100 days of the Sarkisian presidency, the radicals have continued their destructive activities. They continue to disseminate inaccurate factual information and deliberately misleading assessments of the government's activities, just as they did during the run-up to the February 19 presidential election and in the weeks that followed. And they denounce as bureaucrats those of our European colleagues who hail the progress Armenia has made during President Sarkisian's first 100 day in office -- even though that progress is obvious.",,,

They could have been charged or released during the new president's first 100 days in office. They were not.The Armenian judiciary could have affirmed its independence from the executive branch and handed down an impartial assessment of the February 19 presidential ballot, which was marred by systematic procedural violations and widespread bribery, intimidation, and fraud. It chose not to do so. The tragedy of March 1, 2008, when police and security forces descended upon their own citizens, forcibly dispersed thousands of protesters encamped on Liberty Square, and later resorted to brute violence that culminated in 10 deaths, could have been evaluated by a commission devoted to establishing the truth. The government could have invited opposition parties to participate in that process as equals. It did not.Opposition groups, and indeed civil society itself, planned peaceful demonstrations at Liberty Square, the Matenadaran Museum of Ancient Manuscripts, and other locations in Yerevan. The city administration could have granted official permission for those demonstrations. It did not.That retreat from democratic practice has harmed Armenia's reputation abroad. The UN General Assembly and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe have both passed one-sided, antihistoric, legally unfounded, and politically prejudiced resolutions that effectively made those institutions complicit in Azerbaijan's aggressive campaign to scuttle the ongoing peace negotiations and ultimately to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. That region in 1988 was the first in the former USSR to seize on the opportunity presented by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost in a bid reverse the legacy of Stalin's divide-and-rule politics and seek decolonization and independence in full compliance with international and Soviet law.Had it been competent and democratic, the Armenian government could have defeated these partisan, polemical, and duplicitous resolutions, which designate Nagorno-Karabakh as ""occupied"" territory. It was not competent and democratic, so it could not.The current authorities and the political parties that support them, which together account for more than 95 percent of parliament deputies despite having polled a far smaller percentage of votes, have an obligation to reach out to the opposition, both within parliament and on the street. They have done neither.No one can demand or even expect an immediate and total break with the policies espoused by the previous leadership, although President Serzh Sarkisian has claimed to have achieved precisely that. But we citizens of Armenia have demanded immediate action on a number of yes-or-no issues that could have, and should have, been resolved swiftly -- certainly within 100 days of Sarkisian taking office.But the answer has invariably been negative: No release of political prisoners. No fair and impartial inquiry into the March 1 violence. No unrestricted demonstrations for democracy.Those refusals have damaged Armenia's international aspirations -- and Karabakh's. More importantly, they have paralyzed our nation's trust in authorities who were elected through deviance, confirmed by blood, crowned in emergency rule, and inaugurated against a backdrop of crowded prisons. The real 100-day question is whether these are the aftershocks of a bygone era or the birth pangs of a new one.We, the citizens of Armenia, stand firm against the tidal wave of corruption. We will accept nothing less than a systemic shift in Armenia's governance that paves the way for the return of democracy to a land where it once flourished.",,,

There are rumblings about rapprochement between Armenia and Turkey. Peace talks on Nagorno-Karabakh are gaining fresh momentum.The volatile South Caucasus has been making more than its share of news recently, and Matthew Bryza, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, has been in the center of the action.Bryza spoke on July 18 with RFE/RL's Brian Whitmore about the developments in this explosive and strategically important region. RFE/RL: There's currently a lot of movement on Georgia and Abkhazia. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier is engaging in a bit of shuttle diplomacy between Georgia, Abkhazia, and Russia to push that peace plan. Can we expect to see movement on this issue, given that each side has already rejected key components of the plan? Matthew Bryza: I am just beginning to see the press reports on the Steinmeier visit and it looks like the Abkhaz side echoed [Russian] Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov's statement yesterday (July 17) extremely unhelpfully and rejected the core concept of what it takes to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Abkhazia conflict. That is, the link of Georgia issuing a nonuse-of-force pledge with the return of internally displaced Georgians to Abkhazia. That is the absolutely essential bargain that must be struck to be able to move a peace process forward. So I think we're quite worried when Abkhazia, echoed by Moscow, says they won't now agree to that bargain, which we have talked about for years. It makes me think that somebody wants to scuttle this good-faith effort by the UN Friends [for Georgia, grouping Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States], and by the German foreign minister, not to mention by the U.S. secretary of state, who was in Tbilisi last week, and all of us in the UN Friends process, to which I am the U.S. representative. So those are very worrisome public statements coming out of both Sukhumi and Moscow, and I hope it's just posturing. I hope we will get back to where we were during my own visit to Tbilisi and Sukhumi in May, which was quite close to an announcement of a bargain, or the outlines of a bargain or a deal based on what I said before -- the pledge not to use force on the Georgian side, and the pledge that Georgian IDPs (internally displaced people) could return to Abkhazia. And then we would hope that there would be a de-escalation of the military tension in the sensitive Abkhazian-Georgian region of the Kodori Valley. 'Not A Good Faith Set Of Preconditions'RFE/RL: The Georgians have also rejected signing the nonuse-of-force pledge, arguing that this would constitute sort of a de facto recognition of Abkhazia's statehood. But a lot of people are interpreting that as posturing. Do you find the Georgian position unhelpful in this regard? Bryza: What the Georgians have said is we are not going to issue a nonuse-of-force pledge as a precondition for starting direct negotiations with the Abkhaz. The Russian position and the Abkhaz position is the same: There cannot be direct peace talks unless the Georgians issue the nonuse-of-force pledge as a precondition and unless the Georgians pull out their police from the Kodori Valley, which is sovereign Georgian territory. It is impossible for any negotiating party to agree to the core elements of the bargain that needs to be struck as a precondition for launching the negotiations. That is not a good-faith set of preconditions. The Georgians have clearly said that of course they are willing to issue that nonuse-of-force pledge as part of a broader bargain -- that I outlined a moment ago -- during direct negotiations with the Abkhaz and the Georgians. I just can't understand how anybody who is in favor of peace could possibly say at this moment of high tension regarding the Abkhazia conflict, that there ought to be preconditions to the Abkhaz and Georgians sitting down for direct talks. I think Tbilisi shares that view, but that is U.S. policy. RFE/RL: Russia appears to be playing two roles in this process. One official, as a member of the Friends group; the other unofficial, as the de facto patron of the Abkhaz side. Can Russia be an honest broker in this situation? Bryza: That's a fair question. We have said clearly that Russia's behavior since April 16, when the Kremlin issued instructions for the Russian government to strengthen its ties to the separatist regions of Georgia, that those actions undercut Russia's role as ""facilitator"" of the UN Friends process. And Russia took further steps that undercut its role as the facilitator when it shot down the Georgian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on April 20, and then moved paratroopers with heavy artillery into Abkhazia without consulting Georgia, which violates the 1994 Moscow cease-fire agreement. Not to mention that the shootdown is a violation of the UN Charter. And just as we got Georgia to a point where it was de-escalating by not flying any more of those UAVs, the next day Russia sent in rail construction troops without consulting the Georgians again. So every step of the way when we've worked with the Georgians meticulously to get them to de-escalate, the Russian side has decided to take a very provocative step. And so if that's the way it is going to behave and still be a member of the Friends process, it is very difficult practically to get the Friends process to move forward and to finalize this useful paper that our German coordinator of the Friends helped us agree upon back on June 30 in Berlin.So you ask a core question. And the question really is, to put it in a different way: Does Russia wish to behave as the facilitator of the Friends process, or as a mediator, rather than as a party to the conflict? That is an open question. RFE/RL: Georgia wants Russia out of the UN Friends Group, but I don't know that the United States have gotten officially to that point yet. Bryza: Definitely not. Russia has to be part of the process; it's just inevitable. Russia has the peacekeepers on the ground, Russia is geographically contiguous to Abkhazia, Russia is trying to use Abkhazia as a construction site or colony for the Sochi Olympics. Russia is going to be part of the game and, frankly, the Abkhaz look toward Russia today for security -- physical security, economic security, political security.So the way out of this can't be that Russia is not part of the process, that is absolutely impossible. We want Russia in the process. The way out of this is that the international community, and most importantly Georgia, provides the Abkhaz with those types of security -- physical, economic, cultural, and political. What I mean by the latter is that for any agreement to resolve the Abkhazia conflict, 250,000 Georgian internally displaced persons will have to return to Abkhazia, and there are only 55,000 or so Abkhaz. So when those Georgians come back, the Abkhaz must not be worried about being overwhelmed politically or culturally. Their cultural rights need to be preserved, and of course they need to retain some kind of disproportionate political role in Abkhazia, just as we've negotiated in Bosnia for minorities there, and just as we've talked about in Cyprus, or as Kofi Annan had incorporated into his Cyprus settlement plan. 'No Restrictions, No Preconditions'RFE/RL: The United States has its own proposal to replace, or supplement, the peacekeeping mission with an international police force. Is this plan working in concert with the Friends Group plan? Bryza: Yes, everything we do aims to support the Friends process, and at the same time get direct talks going between Abkhazia and Georgia. If one of the Friends has decided it is against Abkhaz-Georgian direct talks, then that party is making it impossible for the Friends' agenda to be realized; and we are still going to do everything we possibly can to get the Abkhaz and the Georgians to be able to talk face to face with no restrictions and no preconditions. But we believe that by so doing, we are actually moving the Friends process forward, because that's the only way you can fulfill the Friends' mandate of trying to resolve the conflict. We are also working to try to implement, or further develop, Phase One of this Friends plan. So everything we've been doing -- when Secretary [Condoleezza Rice] was in Tbilisi and my boss, Assistant Secretary [Daniel] Fried was there, which led to this talk of some other U.S. paper -- is really an attempt to get phase one of this Friends plan moving. The Phase One focuses on military de-escalation. Georgia President Mikheil SaakashviliSo we're supporting the Friends process. Our proposal is definitely -- at this point at least -- not to replace the CIS peacekeepers. That's an issue that has to be worked out between Georgia and Russia in the context of the existing agreements. The 1994 Moscow cease-fire agreement calls for the consent of the host government, as do CIS documents. So Georgia and Russia have to work out the status of the CIS peacekeepers. We're not calling for the removal of the CIS peacekeepers; that's not our business, we have said in Security Council resolutions that we encourage cooperation between CIS peacekeepers and the UN observer mission in Georgia. That said, we do definitely see the need for some security capabilities to complement the CIS peacekeepers -- not necessarily to replace, but to complement. Why? Because in the Gali district, in southern Abkhazia, Georgia, there is a serious law-enforcement problem. The Abkhaz police are unable to provide law enforcement for the population there, which is where the largest concentration of ethnic Georgians are; the CIS peacekeepers don't have a mandate there. Something has to happen, there needs to be a capability. What we could see there could be a joint Georgian and Abkhaz police with international oversight, be it UN or EU oversight. Back up in the Kodori Valley, similarly, there could be joint Georgian and Abkhaz police that have strong international oversight in the form of the EU or the UN. So we're trying to think through whether or not these models are workable as a way to complement the existing CIS peacekeepers. RFE/RL: The U.S. and Georgia are holding joint military exercises near Tbilisi, and Russia is conducting military exercises in the North Caucasus. Both sides said these exercises were planned a long time ago. But some commentators said that with tensions so high, this isn't really a good idea. Do you think these exercises harm, help, or are neutral as far as the peace process goes? Bryza: I can't comment on Russian plans or motivations. What I can say is that we had had this exercise planned for a couple of years. In fact, the participants are not just the U.S. and Georgia, it is also Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Ukraine as part of the NATO Partnership for Peace partners effort. We do one such annual exercise in some country among the NATO PfP partners, and this year it had just so happened to fall to Georgia. Our decision was, do we cancel it or do we go ahead after Russia turned up the pressure on Abkhazia? And our decision was we should go ahead, this was planned for a long, long time. It is mostly a tabletop exercise in Tbilisi; there aren't massive maneuvers planned, it's much more modest than what I've heard is going on on the Russian side in the North Caucasus. I would hope it enhances security throughout the region by helping to increase the professionalization and cooperation of all these military forces; professionalism is of course the key to military security. 'Effort Under Way That Is Genuine'RFE/RL: Let's take a look at Armenia. The new president, Serzh Sarkisian, has published a comment in ""The Wall Street Journal"" intimating that a rapprochement with Turkey is in the works. He invited Turkish President Abdullah Gul to Armenia to watch a football match in September. And now Turkish newspapers are reporting that Turkish and Armenian officials recently held secret talks in Bern. Do you think something is up? I can say with some confidence that yes, there is an effort under way that is genuine in both Yerevan and Ankara to try to normalize relations between the two countries. Bryza: Yes, I do. I was just in Yerevan a week and a half ago and saw President Sarkisian, Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian. I was with the foreign minister extensively during his visit in Washington this week. We spent a couple hours together over lunch. And then I was in Ankara last week, on Thursday and Friday (July 10-11) meetings with the prime minister and deputy foreign minister and the Caucasus team and the prime minister's adviser on foreign policy and the military. So I think I have a pretty good feel for what people are thinking and can say with some confidence that yes, there is an effort under way that is genuine in both Yerevan and Ankara to try to normalize relations between the two countries. RFE/RL: Are we to assume that Gul will accept Sarkisian's invitation? Bryza: I sure hope so. I certainly cannot speak for President Gul or the Turkish government, but we sure hope that he does takes advantage of this golden opportunity to use an international event that just is a gift on the calendar to advance all these processes that I've just mentioned. I should also recognize that President Sarkisian took a courageous step by inviting President Gul, and then also by talking about the possibility of a historical commission which engendered a lot of opposition and criticism from Armenian politicians who used to call for those very same steps. RFE/RL: Russia seems to be taking the lead on this possible detente. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has traveled recently to Armenia and Turkey; Sarkisian was in Moscow when he made his invitation to Gul. Is it acting in concert with the United States? Bryza: I don't know of any single step the Russian government has taken to encourage rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia. That's not a critical statement; that's just a statement of fact. So I am taken aback by the notion that Russia is somehow leading in this effort. Turkey and Armenia are doing this themselves. Maybe the Russians are saying things quietly behind the scenes; I don't know. I'm completely unaware of that. RFE/RL: One analyst we've spoken to -- someone who follows these things really closely -- said he thinks the Russian diplomats got the order to surpass the American initiative on this one. Bryza: Great! Great if they did! I haven't seen any evidence thereof, but we'd welcome it. If Russia is encouraging rapprochement between these two countries, that would be a terrific thing. RFE/RL: Were your recent trips to Turkey and Armenia tied to the rapprochement talks, or was this just a routine visit? Bryza: Whenever I go to these places, there are just so many items on the agenda. And so agenda items include energy -- I was in Turkey with [U.S. Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy] Boyden Gray. And then all the stuff I do bilaterally with Turkey -- of which Armenia and reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia is a top-level issue, as are general issues in the Caucasus and Georgia. So we talked about that, Cyprus, Turkey's EU accession, and the domestic situation in Turkey, and of course our cooperation with Turkey in Iraq, not only against terrorists but also to facilitate the participation by Sunnis in the political life in Iraq. So there's a lot on the agenda in Turkey. In Armenia, I went there also with Turkey-Armenia rapprochement as an issue, but primarily, of course, in my capacity as a Minsk Group co-chair to focus on Nagorno-Karabakh. And, of course, the domestic political situation as Armenia recovers from the problems with the elections and the tragic aftermath. 'Talks Actually Are Jump-Started'RFE/RL: The Turkish-Armenian relationship is of course bound up in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks. But those negotiations appear to be stalled. Is there any way to get them jump-started? The talks actually are jump-started. We don't talk so openly about what's happening, and so I wouldn't expect folks on the outside to know the degree of movement that's under way...Bryza: The talks actually are jump-started. We don't talk so openly about what's happening, and so I wouldn't expect folks on the outside to know the degree of movement that's under way, but on June 6, the presidents Sarkisian and [Ilham] Aliyev had their first meeting, in St. Petersburg, and the statements that they made afterward were indicative of a process that is indeed full of life. President Aliyev said that the two presidents established a certain degree of trust in each other, which was amazing. And President Sarkisian echoed that. And then both presidents called on the Minsk Group to reinvigorate its actions now that the Armenian elections are over. And both presidents called on us, the Minsk Group co-chairs, to work with their foreign ministers to try to bridge the gaps in the remaining couple of issues out there in the Basic Principles that were proposed by us co-chairs back in November in Madrid. So obviously that was a key focus of Foreign Minister Nalbandian's visit here in Washington, and we the Minsk Group co-chairs are going to get together with the foreign ministers again; I hope it's going to be on the 31st of July or 1st of August in Moscow. So the process is going, yeah! The question is, of course, can the two sides bridge the gaps on the final couple of issues. Of those issues, a few of them are quite easily resolvable, and then one or one and a half will require some tough compromises. RFE/RL: Can you tell us any more about these outstanding issues? Bryza: I can't, because that would not be fair to the negotiators themselves. RFE/RL: But what you seem to be suggesting is that there's movement on Nagorno-Karabakh, and movement on a Turkey-Armenia detente. Is something really big going on? Bryza: I don't know. You've got wheels that are turning, but wheels that may not lead to a resolution of any of these issues. But diplomacy is about both process and results. And the art of diplomacy is using the process to help parties who think they can't find common ground to find that common ground. So I'm feeling positive momentum as a result of the process, but it would be a little bit reckless to predict a positive outcome -- or a negative one, for that matter. We've got to keep our noses collectively to the grindstone, and embrace this positive momentum and try to channel it toward the results we seek. RFE/RL: We all know there have been a lot of false starts on this. How optimistic are you right now compared to previous times when we thought progress was at hand on this issue? Bryza: I guess I remain kind of ""skesimistic."" We invented that term, skesimistic, in our Minsk Group. Lots of skepticism and optimism as well. I don't know if I can quantify it, but I can say the prerequisites on Karabakh for reaching agreement on the basic principles may be falling into place. The two presidents seem to have a certain level of trust in each other and have demonstrated a readiness to engage in a give-and-take that does take into account each side's needs and interests. Those are the key prerequisites. But that is not a guarantee that the final differences are bridgeable. In any negotiation on something as sensitive and complex as Nagorno-Karabakh, it's the last issue, or the last couple issues, that are often the hardest to resolve. So I can't predict what will happen, but I am paid to be an optimist and I feel that those who pay me for that optimism are being well served. 'We Have Seen Some Progress'RFE/RL: Before we move on to issues pertaining to Azerbaijan, is there anything you would like to add about Armenia, Turkey, and Karabakh? Bryza: Yes, there is. President Sarkisian came into office under very difficult circumstances: an election that was questioned and unprecedented postelection violence for the South Caucasus on March 1 and 2. He faces really serious challenges, but he seems to understand what these challenges are, and I personally have confidence in his ability to address those problems, which still require some work. Armenian President Serzh SarkisianWhat those are are arrests of opposition politicians, opposition activists for their participation in the events of March 1 and 2. There still is a political divide between the government and opposition that we would like to see closed. There are still some restrictions on freedom of assembly. So all those issues need to be worked through. We really want to see the release of those activists and politicians who are still under arrest. There are some trials pending for people who were arrested on March 1st and 2nd for political reasons. We would like to see all that go away and be resolved in accordance with the rule of law and democratic principles. Again, though, that all said, we do sense that the president, Sarkisian, does recognize these serious challenges and the need to restore democratic principles. We have seen some progress on rule of law in the economic sphere under his prime minister, [Tigran] Sarkisian -- same surname, no relationship. So overall, the domestic situation in Armenia is hopefully on a more positive trajectory. There will be a big decision that our Millennium Challenge corporation will have to take -- I mean the board will need to take -- in September about whether to continue the program. And the board decided in June to follow a wait-and-see approach and hope that the, at that time, very nascent signs of a restoration of democratic momentum will gain their own momentum. I hope that is what we are now seeing, but it is too early to tell. I think that it is by virtue of restoring the democratic momentum that Armenia will become more confident and more able to advance the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process. Just as I would argue that rapprochement with Turkey should also help Armenia become more able to be more flexible in the negotiations. And we want to see the same thing happen on the Azerbaijani side. We hope that as these processes move forward, Azerbaijan will see it in itself to use its burgeoning economic wealth as a way to bring the parties together, rather than increase any sort of tension. And as far as using wealth to build understanding, President Aliyev has actually shown that vision and we commend him for that.Azerbaijani President Ilham AliyevRFE/RL: Azerbaijan's presidential election is scheduled for October. Do you think the current environment in that country, with so many journalists in prison and the atmosphere of intimidation so strong, is conducive to free and fair elections?Bryza: President Ilham Aliyev seems to understand the importance of conducting an election that the international community recognizes as free and fair. That goal is a central focus of our relationship with Azerbaijan, with his government, and with him. So we hope that his election will prove to be just that. It's true, however, that the arrests of journalists, what people are reporting as harassment of them, and limitations on freedom of assembly, work against the perception and perhaps the reality that the election will be free and fair. We have been working through our embassy and our assistance programs that are managed here and in Baku to try to get the mechanisms of democracy of an election in place so that the election will be as free and fair as possible. I can't handicap what the outcome will be now, but I can say that as in Armenia, where we had an unprecedented level of violence after the election -- an election that was questioned -- so do we want to make sure that the procedures are in place to make sure this election is seen as free and fair as possible. RFE/RL: How much leverage does the United States have to get these journalists out of prison? Bryza: I don't know how to assess how much leverage we have, I can just say that getting these people out of jail is a high priority, it's something we work on every day -- I do, and our ambassador does. We need to be constantly pushing on that issue. I should just add that Azerbaijan is an important friend of the United States -- Azerbaijan overall, the entire country. We have a lot of important issues on the agenda. We have three key sets of strategic interests -- expansion of political and economic freedom to reform, or democratic and market economic reform; security cooperation; and, of course, energy cooperation with Azerbaijan. We need to be moving forward in all three sets of those interests and encouraging Azerbaijan's evolution toward democracy as a key element. We know that in the long run, stability will come from legitimacy, which requires free and fair elections. So that's what we're pushing toward.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Football_Diplomacy_Peace/1184293.html,Can Football Diplomacy Lead To Peace ,"July 16, 2008 16:15 GMT",,,"Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian has decided to try a little ""football diplomacy"" to defuse longstanding tensions with neighboring Turkey.During a visit to Moscow in June, Sarkisian made waves by publicly announcing that he would like his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, to come to Yerevan to watch a World Cup qualifying soccer match between the two countries in September.The Armenian leader repeated the invitation in a commentary titled ""We Are Ready To Talk To Turkey,"" published in the U.S. daily ""The Wall Street Journal"" on July 9. ""There is no real alternative to the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between our countries,"" Sarkisian wrote. ""It is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold to this new open door.""The Turkish Foreign Ministry says it is ""studying"" the proposal.The sports element lends Sarkisian's overture a tantalizing historical appeal, evoking memories of the ""ping-pong diplomacy"" of the 1970s -- when an exchange of table-tennis teams helped set the stage for eventual rapprochement between the United States and China.But what caused many observers to wonder aloud whether the current initiative might just lead to something serious was Russia's apparent willingness to throw its diplomatic weight behind the idea -- and grab the mantle on an issue where U.S. diplomats have, until now, played the leading role. ""Russian diplomats have been given the task of moving beyond the American initiative to normalize Armenian-Turkish relations,"" David Hovhannisyan, a former Armenian diplomat and Yerevan-based political analyst, says.Hovhannisyan adds that it is highly unlikely that Sarkisian would have made his dramatic gesture in Moscow without his host's consent. Moreover, just a week after Sarkisian's visit to Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Istanbul, with the Armenia issue reportedly part of his agenda.Adding to the air of anticipation, Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian flew to Washington for an official visit this week.""Moscow has developed a good relationship with Ankara, and being able to continue to develop that relationship, without complications emanating from its support for Yerevan, would be something that I think the Russian government would welcome,"" says Bulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Mosaic Of DistrustTurkey's frosty relations with Armenia, however, are part of a larger mosaic of deep animosities, historical grievances, and bitter tensions that have long plagued the region.Turkey was among the first countries to recognize Armenian independence after the breakup of the Soviet Union. But when Armenian forces occupied Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region, Ankara broke off diplomatic ties with Yerevan and closed its border with Armenia. Most analysts say it is highly unlikely that Turkey would make any moves toward rapprochement with Armenia without Azerbaijan's consent -- making Armenian-Turkish reconciliation tightly bound to a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.Moreover, Yerevan's claim that the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I constitutes genocide is angrily rejected by Turkey and continues to be a major roadblock in normalizing relations. In an attempt to entice Istanbul, Sarkisian has offered to have a joint commission of Armenian and Turkish scholars investigate the claims.Observers in Turkey nevertheless remain skeptical.Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul""It looks like Armenia seriously wants to negotiate, but as far as we see there is no change in their position on Karabakh or on questions of Turkey's territorial integrity,"" Omer Lutem head of the Armenia department at the Istanbul-based Eurasian Strategic Research Center told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service in a recent interview. ""Will they give up on their claims of genocide, or will they fight? Will they make changes or not? It is not clear. If there will not be any changes, how will the question be resolved?""Alizira agreed that untangling this web and resolving these issues would prove to be a complicated task. ""There have been a lot of false dawns on this front,"" he said.But some observers say that the politics of the region at this particular time gives Moscow plenty of incentives to try. Moscow's MotivesRussia has been steadily losing influence in the South Caucasus in recent years. Relations with Georgia are embroiled in deep hostility over the pro-Moscow separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and over Tbilisi's bid to join NATO. Azerbaijan, whose energy wealth grants it a degree of independence from Moscow, is increasingly looking West as well. Russia maintains a large degree of influence in Armenia, where it maintains a military base and has invested heavily -- particularly in the energy sector. Alexander Iskandarian, director of Caucasus Media Institute in Yerevan, calls Armenia ""Russia's only trusted partner in the South Caucasus,"" adding that it is not in Russia's interests to have such an ally isolated, with its borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan closed. Moreover, Russian firms investing in Armenia badly want the border opened so they can use the country as a springboard to expand into markets throughout the region and beyond.""When Russia was in a different position in the South Caucasus, the fact that Armenia was so isolated wasn't so troublesome. Since the situation has changed, Russia is less satisfied with this situation,"" Iskandarian says. ""If the road to Turkey were open, and it will open if there would be normal diplomatic relations, Russian capital here could use this. It could go to the Turkish market, export goods and services. And Russian capital and Russian investment in Armenia is not small. This opens possibilities and makes entry into the Southern European and Middle Eastern markets cheaper.""Total Russian investment in Armenia reached $1.2 billion this year. A spin-off company of Russia's former electricity monopoly Unified Energy Systems operates Armenia's only nuclear power plant and would like to use Armenia's grid to sell power to Turkey and elsewhere in the region. The state-controlled natural-gas monopoly Gazprom owns a majority stake in Armenia's gas-distribution network. Russian investment is also heavy in the banking and gaming sectors. Questions remain, however, about whether Russia has enough over Turkey and Armenia to broker a deal.""I don't think that they have much leverage on the Turkish side of the fence, and I'm not sure how much leverage they have on the Armenian side of the fence,"" Aliriza says. ""Secondly, the Russian-Turkish relationship, which is so important to Moscow and to Ankara for so many reasons, is not going to be a function of the Turkish-Armenian relationship from Moscow's point of view.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Genocide_Question_Still_Haunts_Armenia_Turkey_Relations/1182898.html,Genocide Question Still Haunts ArmeniaTurkey Relations ,"July 10, 2008 13:49 GMT",,,"Signaling a major policy shift, President Serzh Sarkisian has confirmed he is ready to accept, in principle, Turkey's proposal to form a commission of Armenian and Turkish historians that would examine the 1915-18 mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.Sarkisian on June 26 made clear through a spokesman, however, that such a commission should be created only after Turkey agrees unconditionally to establish diplomatic relations and open its border with Armenia. But on June 30, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation--Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), one of four parties represented in the coalition government, joined other opposition parties in criticizing Sarkisian's support for the Turkish proposal.The proposal for a joint commission was formally made by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a 2005 letter to then-Armenian President Robert Kocharian. Erdogan suggested that the proposed commission determine whether the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire constituted genocide and said his government would accept any conclusion it reached.In a written reply, Kocharian effectively rejected the idea and came up with a counterproposal to set up a Turkish-Armenian intergovernmental commission that would deal with this and other issues of mutual concern. Other Armenian officials, backed by local and diaspora scholars, dismissed Erdogan's move as a Turkish ploy designed to scuttle international recognition of the Armenian ""genocide."" They also said that by agreeing to the proposed study, the Armenian side would signal a willingness to consider doubts regarding the genocide question.""We are not against the creation of such a commission, but only if the border between our countries is opened,"" Sarkisian declared during a visit to Moscow last week. His press secretary, Samvel Farmanian, reaffirmed this in a statement issued on June 26. ""We are not against any study of even obvious facts and widely accepted realities,"" Farmanian said. ""Agreeing to a study does not mean casting doubt on the veracity of facts. However, the creation of such a commission would be logical only after the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of the border between our countries. Otherwise, it could become a tool for dragging out and exploiting existing problems.""Armenia's leading opposition groups, including the Popular Movement headed former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, were quick to condemn Sarkisian's comments, saying that by accepting Ankara's proposal in principle, he called into question the very fact of what many historians regard as the first genocide of the 20th century. Farmanian rejected that argument. ""It is strange that the genocide issue is being exploited by individuals who had done everything in the past to condemn that tragic page of our history to oblivion,"" he said in a jibe at the more conciliatory line that Ter-Petrossian adopted vis-a-vis Turkey.The opposition concerns have since been echoed by the HHD, which has for decades been known for its hard line on Armenia's relations with Turkey. The party's official position is that Turkey must not only admit to the genocide, but also compensate the descendants of victims and cede large swathes of its formerly Armenian-populated territory to Armenia. Successive Armenian governments have stressed, however, that Armenia has no formal territorial claims on Turkey. ""Genocide recognition by Turkey will not lead to legal consequences for territorial claims,"" Kocharian stated in a 2001 interview with a Turkish TV station.""We have received the necessary explanation and clarification from the president,"" Giro Manoyan, a spokesman for the HHD's governing bureau, told RFE/RL. ""Also, the president's spokesman and the foreign minister have publicly clarified that the president's consent pertains to another kind of commission."" In Manoyan's words, Sarkisian believes the would-be commission should not determine whether or not a genocide occurred in 1915-18 and should instead research ""various details of the genocide."" ""In any case, our approach is that there was no need to make such statements and create this confusion in the first place,"" he said.Manoyan also expressed his party's unease about Sarkisian's stated intention to invite Turkish President Abdullah Gul to the first-ever game between the national soccer teams of Armenia and Turkey, which will be played in Yerevan in early September. ""I think that if the president of Turkey visits Yerevan, at least one part of our society will express its attitude,"" he said. On July 1, the daily ""Taregir"" offered an alternative explanation for Sarkisian's affirmation of support for the establishment of a Turkish-Armenian commission of historians. ""As is known, Moscow has always been jealous about the [prospect of a] normalization of relations between Yerevan and Ankara,"" says the paper. ""The Kremlin has always managed to torpedo all initiatives aimed reopening the Turkish-Armenian border, fearing the loss of its influence in Armenia.However, there have been suggestions lately that Russian capital, which is increasingly establishing itself in Armenia, is keen to use our country as a launch pad for occupying the vast Turkish market. That is, Moscow is not against an open border, provided that border is under its control. So maybe Sarkisian's proposal should be viewed in that context.""",,,
,D,https://www.rferl.org/a/Armenia_Long_Hot_Political_Summer/1181449.html,Armenias Long Hot Political Summer ,"July 03, 2008 11:22 GMT",,Violent protests in Yerevan in response to the election,"With the onset of a traditionally hot summer, Armenia remains susceptible to months of political volatility. Since the inauguration less than three months ago of Serzh Sarkisian as Armenia's third president, the confrontation between the new leadership and the opposition led by former President Levon Ter-Petrossian has shown little sign of abating.The country faces a simmering political crisis rooted in the mass protests that followed the controversial February 19 presidential election in which official returns showed Sarkisian polling over 52 percent of the vote versus 21.5 percent for former President Levon Ter-Petrossian. Those protests culminated in a violent clash between opposition demonstrators and riot police on March 1-2 that left at least 10 people dead and many injured.After imposing a state of emergency reinforced by sweeping restrictions on the freedoms of press and assembly, outgoing President Robert Kocharian left office burdened by a sudden unpopularity in reaction to what was widely regarded as an unjustifiable overreaction to opposition demonstrations.But most importantly, after eight years of holding the country's highest post, Kocharian bequeathed his successor a dangerous legacy of distrust and discontent. Sarkisian has inherited a ""crisis of confidence"" that has eroded confidence in the government and faces a further challenge in the form of public demands for change. Moreover, three crucial new developments have contributed to a political crisis unprecedented in Armenia's recent history. Series Of TestsSarkisian's first impediment is a distinctly new political context insofar as the population has emerged from years of apathy to voice fresh and strident demands for change. This means there can be no return to the pre-election status quo, as the Armenian people have expressed a new sense of impatience and outrage.The most visible affirmation of a public no longer mired in apathy and passivity has been the opposition's success in maintaining its political momentum through rallies and demonstrations. On June 20, in the first opposition demonstration following the lifting of the state of emergency, Ter-Petrossian was able to mobilize thousands of supporters in Yerevan. That initiative posed a crucial two-part test for the opposition and its leaders. It was, first and foremost, a test of numbers -- an indication as to whether the public had the appetite for sustaining the protests into the hot summer. It was also a test of resolve pitting the authorities against the opposition, as a detachment of riot police initially attempted to deny access to the planned venue before backing down at the last minute in the face of the crowd's determination. That very public, last-minute backdown by police emboldened the demonstrators. It also tended to validate the opposition decision to proceed with the unsanctioned rally after the municipal authorities' attempt to contain the rally by only granting permission to use a remote sports arena.That initial success was followed a week later by a demonstration in Gyumri, the country's second-largest city. Several thousand Ter-Petrossian supporters turned out despite inclement weather. The Gyumri city authorities granted official permission and police maintained a respectful distance with no interference.Despite the limitations of such rallies in achieving concrete political demands, they provide the opposition with a mechanism for maintaining momentum, and they exert a very public pressure on the government. With these goals in mind, the opposition is planning another rally on July 4, coinciding with a traditional diplomatic reception at the U.S. Embassy celebrating American independence that is usually attended by much of Armenia's political and business elite. The second impediment facing Sarkisian stems not from the opposition but from the inherent limits on his own power and authority. In other words, just as the Armenian people have been reinvigorated by a new sense of dynamic activism, the Armenian government finds itself hobbled by an equally new and somewhat overwhelming unpopularity and skepticism. This is, at least in part, rooted in the opaque nature of the Armenian political system, where dissent is seen as a direct threat to the state rather than as characteristic of a healthy democracy. Within such a closed political system, there is no mechanism for expressing political discontent, a lack that exacerbates underlying tensions. Consequently, the crisis is likely to become more acute in the coming months.Third, Sarkisian faces another new rival than just the freshly united opposition. Surprisingly, while that rival is a former president, it is not Ter-Petrossian but rather Sarkisian's out-of-office -- but not out-of power -- predecessor, Kocharian, who is still exerting influence over the government. Kocharian succeeded in implanting within Sarkisian's team one of his most loyal henchmen, former presidential chief of staff Armen Gevorgian, while a second long-time Kocharian associate, Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian, who has repeatedly argued that the March 1 crackdown was entirely justified, remains in his post. Kocharian is thus still in a position to wield influence from within to preempt decisions counter to his power or interests. Turning A PageKocharian's ability to shape the political agenda is likely to prove fleeting insofar as it is based on his personal influence over key parliament deputies and one of the four parties in the coalition government, Bargavach Hayastan (Prosperous Armenia). Such parliamentary power, although effective in the short term, is unsustainable over the medium term since deputies naturally gravitate to the official center of power. It is a political maxim that that power erodes without position over the long term and Kocharian -- unlike his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin -- does not hold the premiership. Sarkisian is growing stronger every day, while his predecessor's influence is eroding.Managing the Kocharian challenge is a more manageable task for the current president. The deeper and more fundamental impediments come from the government's more lasting degree of weakness and disability.Moreover, the Armenian government must now learn to govern -- not just rule -- the country. Yet it is disabled by its weakness and undermined by a lack of legitimacy and an absence of any real popular mandate. This not only calls into question the authority of the state, but also seriously erodes the government's capacity to implement the difficult policies needed to satisfy mounting demands for change and expectations for reform. Thus as the political crisis remains far from resolved and likely only to continue, the hot Armenian summer of 2008 may usher in a potentially unprecedented autumn of change, possibly marking the last page of this chapter of Armenian politics.",,,0
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/Controversial_Armenian_Parliamentary_Commission_Begins_Work/1145555.html,Controversial Armenian Parliamentary Commission Begins Work ,"June 26, 2008 16:04 GMT",,,"On June 16, the pro-government factions within the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously in favor of setting up an ad hoc commission to investigate the March 1-2 clashes in Yerevan between supporters of defeated presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian and security forces that resulted in 10 deaths. The conduct of an ""independent, transparent, and credible inquiry"" into the postelection violence was one of the key demands addressed to the Armenian authorities by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) in a resolution adopted in mid-April.At its first session later on June 16, the newly established commission, which is due to present its findings to the National Assembly by October 25, elected Samvel Nikoyan (Republican Party of Armenia, HHK) as its chairman. The deputy-chairman's position was reserved for a representative from Zharangutiun (Heritage), the sole opposition party represented in parliament. The commission was initially to include two parliament deputies from each faction and one independent deputy, giving a total of at least eight pro-government lawmakers and two opposition representatives. But on June 19, it decided to invite to participate in its work all political forces that received more than 3 percent of the popular vote during the May 2007 parliamentary elections but less than the minimum 5 percent needed to win seats in the National Assembly, and also defeated candidates in the February 19 presidential elections, including Ter-Petrossian, or their representatives. As of the afternoon of 19 June, seven invitations had been sent out, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. In addition to Ter-Petrossian, the other forces invited were the National Accord party of Artashes Geghamian, the United Labor Party of Gurgen Arsenian, and the Nor Zhamanakner (New Times) Party of Aram Karapetian. Invitations were also sent to former presidential candidates Tigran Karapetian, Aram Harutiunian, and Vazgen Manukian. Geghamian and Manukian have both named representatives who attended a session for the first time on June 24, Noyan Tapan reported.The Zharangutiun (Heritage) faction opted out of the June 16 vote on setting up the commission and was not even present at the chamber at the time of voting. Zharangutiun faction member Armen Martirosian told RFE/RL the same day that the faction was unlikely to participate in the commission's work because ""our basic proposals were not accepted."" Zharangutiun faction secretary Stepan Safarian similarly told RFE/RL that ""there is a preliminary decision to abstain from having any representative in the commission."" But on June 17, Zharangutiun Chairman Raffi Hovannisian proposed Myasnik Malkhasian and Sasun Mikaelian, both of whom are currently being held in pretrial detention on charges of organizing mass unrest and attempting to seize power stemming from their alleged involvement in the March 1 violence, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Both men are nominally still members of the HHK parliament faction despite having thrown their support behind Ter-Petrossian. Commission Chairman Nikoyan rejected that proposal as ""insulting"" and ""not serious,"" given that under the commission's statutes factions may only nominate their own members, Noyan Tapan reported on June 18. Speaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service in prison on June 19, Malkhasian and a second arrested pro-Ter-Petrossian parliamentarian, Hakob Hakobian, both questioned whether the newly formed commission will prove capable of conducting an ""impartial and objective inquiry"" in light of the imputed bias of some of its members, including Nikoyan, who Malkhasian said has made televised statements exonerating the Armenian authorities. ""The commission cannot work independently,"" Malkhasian said. ""There can be no impartial inquiry because no particular investigation is being conducted today in connection with what should be the main focus of the investigation -- the people who died. There has been no clarification regarding who fired the shots and under what circumstances those people died. There should have been an investigation concerning the wounded, those who inflicted damage on state property. But the investigation today is moving in a different direction. They arrest people and after that they try to fabricate charges against them."" Hakobian for his part expressed regret that the ad hoc commission chose not to co-opt the proposed opposition parliamentarians. ""If the commission wanted to clarify anything, they should have been happy to involve Myasnik Malkhasian and Sasun Mikaelian in its work. Because both of them were on the ground and did not commit any wrongdoing,"" Hakobian said. The sole nonaligned deputy on the commission, Lyova Khachatrian, stepped down on June 24, explaining that he did not wish to contribute the widespread negative perception of the commission, a perception he feared was reinforced by his own friendship with Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian, Noyan Tapan reported on June 25. Also on June 17, the same day that it ruled to establish the ad hoc commission, the Armenian parliament adopted by a vote of 80 votes in favor and four against a statement enumerating measures the authorities have taken to fulfill the demands outlined in the PACE April resolution, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Those demands included the conduct of an independent inquiry into the March 1 violence; the immediate release of opposition supporters detained in the aftermath; and the annulment of legal amendments restricting the right to stage public rallies and demonstrations. While up to 70 opposition supporters remain in pretrial detention, the parliament voted in the second reading on June 11 to lift those restrictions. Two PACE rapporteurs who visited Armenia on June 16-17 concluded that the Armenian authorities were dragging their feet in complying with the resolution's requirements. But during a vote late on June 25 during its summer session, the PACE declined to discipline Armenia for its perceived failure to meet its demands, instead granting the Armenian authorities six more months to comply fully with the April resolution, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on June 26. One of the two rapporteurs, former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, reasoned that ""two months is not enough time to implement all the changes for which we've called.... We believe that Armenia is going in the right direction, and changes are being made."" On June 20 between 10,000-30,000 people attended a rally in Yerevan in support of Ter-Petrossian, who interpreted that show of support as evidence that the population at large does not believe the official election results that gave Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian over 52 percent of the vote compared to 21.5 percent for Ter-Petrossian. It was the first opposition mass rally for which the municipal authorities granted permission since the restrictions imposed by parliament in the wake of the March violence. Addressing that rally, Ter-Petrossian again demanded the immediate and unconditional release of those of his supporters still in detention as a precondition for ""dialogue"" with the authorities, and for the holding of preterm parliamentary and presidential elections in order to restore political stability. A follow-up rally is scheduled for July 4.",,,

But the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) struck an unusually harsh tone at its summer session in Strasbourg.PACE reserved its most severe criticism for some of its newest members, particularly for Azerbaijan, whose human rights record has worsened sharply in recent years.The assembly adopted a resolution spelling out urgent steps to be taken by Azerbaijani authorities ahead of the country's October presidential election.Khadija Ismayilova, a correspondent with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service in Baku, says PACE has reverted to the tough stance it held on Azerbaijan when the country joined the organization in 2001.""At the beginning of Azerbaijan's relations with the Council of Europe, the organization was a bit more demanding toward Azerbaijani authorities -- they demanded 13 reforms,"" Ismayilova says.""Later, the situation changed. Officials at the Council of Europe softened their stance, and Azerbaijani officials became more ignorant of what had been said in the Council of Europe,"" she adds. ""But I think the issue is not about the Council of Europe's stance -- the situation became so critical that the Council of Europe had to respond.""In its resolution, PACE urged Baku to ensure impartial election commissions during the upcoming presidential vote, to provide equal media exposure for political parties, and to guarantee the opposition's right to hold public rallies.The assembly said harassment and intimidation of opposition journalists and limits on freedom of assembly were ""inadmissible in a Council of Europe member state.""PACE also called for the immediate release of opposition journalists Qanimat Zahid, Mirza Sakit Zahidov, and Eynulla Fatullayev, regarded in the West as political prisoners. But Azerbaijani authorities seem unlikely to take note -- both the government and the ruling party have dismissed the resolution as biased.Ismayilova says only extreme measures can pressure Baku into cleaning up its act. ""It's pretty difficult, given that Azerbaijan has a huge oil wealth that is only going to increase in coming years,"" she says. ""In the past, the Azerbaijani government needed international credit, international aid like technical assistance programs. Now that's no longer needed. The only mechanism that the Council of Europe can use to obligate the country to fulfill requirements is threatening the country to cease its membership in the organization. But so far, this message hasn't been sent.""Limited Action On ArmeniaAnother country that came under fire in Strasbourg this week was Armenia, where police clashed with opposition protesters following the victory of Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian in the February presidential election. The clashes, the worst civil violence in Armenia's post-Soviet history, left 10 people dead and prompted a state of emergency. Speaking on June 25 at a news conference in Strasbourg, Council of Europe Secretary-General Terry Davis said the council was keeping a close eye on the probe into the casualties.""Police in Yerevan are responsible for investigating those deaths and identifying the people who killed other people and charging them, bringing them before a court,"" Davis said. ""I keep asking this question, I shall continue to ask it, and no number of inquiries, or investigations, or anything of the sort can absolve the police from their responsibility in a democratic society.""PACE members this week met for an urgent debate on Armenia after the organization's co-rapporteurs concluded Armenian authorities had made insufficient progress following the February events.But they stopped short of stripping Armenia of its voting rights within the body, choosing to postpone the debate until January. Harsh Words For Georgian OppositionPACE also had harsh words for Georgia, whose President Mikheil Saakashvili lost some of his democratic credentials in November when he sent police to forcibly disperse thousands of opposition protesters and imposed a state of emergency.The assembly members, however, concluded that the country's May 21 parliamentary elections -- which handed most seats to Saakashvili's party and its supporters -- were mostly in line with international standards.David Kakabadze, the director of RFE/RL's Georgian Service, believes PACE's assessment was too lenient. ""I think the report was a bit too rosy. Even though there were some critical remarks, I cannot say that it was critical enough,"" he says. ""Even a member of the Georgian delegation whom I interviewed yesterday said the opposition will be outraged when they read this report, because it was definitely quite positive on Georgia. But she said that most of the violations that the opposition is citing are not documented well enough to be reflected in this report.""The Georgian opposition also received its share of criticism at this week's PACE session. Terry Davis called on opposition leaders to challenge the government ""within the limits of democratic discussion, debate and argument,"" and played down the opposition's accusations of voting fraud.""It's not right to assume that because you lose an election there's been cheating on the other side,"" Davis said on June 25. ""Sometimes you lose an election because the majority of people actually prefer the other candidate and the other parties. You have to accept that. I think the situation in Georgia has been exaggerated to some extent, both inside Georgia and outside.""These strong statements may help change the view that PACE is losing its authority. But for now, many member states would like to see still tougher action from the Council of Europe. Deputy Dmitry Diakov, the leader of Moldova's opposition Democratic Party, says the country is making little progress in terms of democratic reform despite the presence of the council's Monitoring Committee.""Monitoring helps countries that want to achieve it,"" he says. ""Moldova's entry in the Council of Europe in 1995 marked the beginning of a romantic period that lasted several years and during which we made very good progress. Things are different nowadays, we have become a problematic country for the Council of Europe, a country that doesn't fulfill its obligations fully and on time -- a country that promises and fails to deliver. Democracy in Moldova is developing, but unfortunately it has become very specific.""The Council of Europe currently monitors 11 member states: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine.PACE wraps up its summer session on June 27 before reconvening on September 29 for a weeklong fall session.",,,

PACE has said an urgent debate on Armenia at its June 23-27 plenary session is ""warranted.""In a statement issued on June 20, it said progress made so far by the Armenian authorities in meeting the assembly's demands has been judged ""insufficient"" by the co-rapporteurs of PACE's Monitoring Committee.One of the co-rapporteurs, French Senator Georges Colombier, tells RFE/RL that there had been a lack of progress on the issue of political prisoners.""It's clear that since the Resolution 1609 was approved last April by the Council of Europe, the authorities have made a lot of progress in meeting our demands, particularly concerning legislative changes,"" Colombier said.

Colombier and the other co-rapporteur, former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, visited the country on June 16-17 to assess the progress.Colombier said PACE will consider imposing sanctions on Armenia, including stripping the country of its voting rights within the assembly.

The protesters were demanding a rerun of the February presidential election, in which then-Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian claimed victory with an official result of 53 percent of the vote.Opposition leader and former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, Sarkisian's main opponent in the contest, disputed the results, alleging the election was marred by numerous voting irregularities.Highlights of PACE's summer session will also include debates on the functioning of democratic institutions in Azerbaijan and Turkey, and a special debate on the state of democracy in Europe, involving guest speakers from civil society.Other topics to be debated include the fight against damage to the environment in the Black Sea and empowering women in a modern, multicultural society.Serbian President Boris Tadic is scheduled to address the assembly on June 26.",,,

The demonstrators have gathered outside the Matenadaran library of ancient manuscripts in the capital center, despite initially being denied permission to gather by city authorities. Police on June 19 warned protesters to stay away from the center, saying they had permission to rally only at a location on the outskirts of Yerevan.Thousands of protesters are assembled at Matenadaran, one of the city's most prominent sites for public gatherings. Protest organizers said as many as 50,000 people were gathered; police put ""maximum"" turnout at 10,000. Early in the day, police had set up checkpoints in an attempt to prevent traffic from reaching the site. But Aleksandr Afyan, the deputy police chief in Yerevan, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service the checkpoints were eventually removed in order to free up traffic jams and after police officials received assurances from opposition leaders that the protest would be peaceful.

Opposition leader and former President Levon Ter-Petrossian is among the speakers due to address the crowd. The gathering is the first of its kind since 10 people were killed during or as a result of violent clashes between police and protesters in March. The fatalities followed days of protests against the conduct of the country's February 19 presidential election, in which then-Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian -- the handpicked successor of the outgoing president, Robert Kocharian -- claimed victory with an official result of 53 percent of the vote. Ter-Petrossian, his main opponent in the contest, disputed the results, saying he was the rightful winner and alleging the election was marred by numerous voting irregularities.International observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe were critical of the vote, noting the lack of a ""level playing field"" during the election campaign.

The first was unrest in our capital after presidential elections in February; the second was a meeting between myself and my neighboring Azerbaijani counterpart on June 7. Both emphasize that Armenia is very much a country in transition, within Europe's neighborhood. Despite the numerous obstacles in our way, however, Armenia is deepening its reforms and strengthening its democratic institutions as part of a path toward sustainable good governance. Postelection disagreements among parties led to an opportunity for me to work to bring together a wide political coalition, incorporating four of the five factions represented in parliament. An important part of that coalition's mission are the large-scale democracy-oriented, social, and economic reforms we are implementing at the moment. We are working together to comply with the letter and spirit of Resolution 1609 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on the functioning of democratic institutions in Armenia. Concrete Changes Tangible reform steps in line with international standards include: -- Amendments to liberalize the Law on Conducting Meetings, Assemblies, Rallies and Demonstrations, -- Broadening the rights of the parliamentary opposition through concrete legislative changes, guaranteeing an inclusive role in the political system and decision-making processes, -- The drafting of a comprehensive amendment package to the electoral code in line with Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recommendations, which includes provisions for participation of intra- and extraparliamentary parties, -- Significant legislative changes to the TV and radio law. All of these reforms are conducted with positive expert assessment by the Council of Europe's Venice Commission. These are, by any measure, decisive steps towards long-term reforms that will address the discontent that emerged after recent elections and guarantee more freedoms for the people of Armenia. We welcome any proposals from the European Union and the upcoming French presidency on supporting this reform process and ensuring that it is implemented effectively. Independent Findings Above and beyond PACE recommendations, we have embarked on major law enforcement reform, and a parliamentary ad hoc committee that includes all factions of the National Assembly has been established to investigate the tragic circumstances of postelectoral events. This committee will have the widest possible involvement to study all facts and come up with its own independent findings. Extraparliamentary groups, civil society institutions, and independent international experts are encouraged to participate in these efforts. We, along with PACE's Monitoring Committee, have observed important progress to date, but there is still much work to be done. Fortunately, the political will exists within our coalition to carry through with our ambitious plans. We recognize that our attractiveness as a partner for Europe and the broader international community is at stake. History has been cruel to Armenia. Our people have overcome enormous difficulties, both in the distant and very recent past. But we are determined that our country will not remain stuck in permanent transition. Taking our cue from the U.S. civil rights movement, I am confident in saying that, despite the challenges ahead in terms of our democratic development, we shall overcome. As an enthusiastic member of the European neighborhood, Armenia will eventually ensure that its democratic governance is irreversible.",Mentions the changing of TV and radio laws to benefit the public,,

The question now, he said, is whether that wave will extend to the easternmost borders of what he called ""wider Europe."" By that, Fried was referring to the Caucasus: specifically, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia -- three very different states that share similar problems. All are struggling to quell internal separatist conflicts, to establish independent judicial institutions and modern financial systems, and, in general, to build new identities as sovereign, successful nation-states. Fried offered his comments to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, which heard that U.S. foreign policy toward all three countries is to support them as they journey along the same path toward full democracy and market-based economies that their neighbors to the West have already traveled. Fried said no outside power -- he mentioned Russia specifically -- should be able to extend its sphere of influence over the three. ""We do not believe that any outside power should be able to threaten or block the sovereign choice of these nations to join the institutions of Europe and the trans-Atlantic family, if they so choose, and if we so choose,"" Fried said. Azerbaijan: Bellicose Rhetoric Thanks to its abundance of oil and natural gas, Azerbaijan has enjoyed three straight years as the world's fastest-growing economy. But Fried said the United States remains concerned about ""a relative lag in democratic reforms,"" including respect for fundamental freedoms such as a free press and the right to assemble. He said finding a peaceful resolution of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh is one of Azerbaijan's biggest challenges. The United States, he said, supports Azerbaijan's territorial integrity but believes the region's final status must be determined through negotiations that take into account ""international legal and political principles."" He acknowledged the progress that Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev made when they met in St. Petersburg on June 6, but said more must be done and cooler heads must prevail. ""Renewed fighting is not a viable option,"" Fried said. ""We have concerns about occasional bellicose rhetoric from Azerbaijani officials and we have urged the government, and will continue to urge the government, to focus on a peaceful resolution of this dispute, noting the benefits a resolution would bring for all of the Caucuses."" A few committee members expressed concern at what they said was Azerbaijan's ""intent to go to war"" with Armenia. Congressman Joe Knollenberg (Republican, Michigan) quoted President Aliyev as saying ""at any moment we must be able to liberate our territories by military means."" He asked Fried what the United States has done to stop ""this war machine."" Fried agreed that the bellicose rhetoric that sometimes comes out of Baku is ""unhelpful"" and said U.S. diplomats had cautioned Aliyev's government against using ""war-like"" language. The United States has also raised the issue of Azerbaijan's energy exports. ""We've also explained to them, frankly, that Azerbaijan's wealth comes from the export of gas and oil, and that a war puts that at risk very quickly,"" Fried said. ""It is also the judgment of the United States that Azerbaijan does not have a military superiority over Armenia and that a war would be costly to both sides and unwinnable by either one."" Russian 'Campaign Of Pressure' Against Georgia As for Georgia, Fried said the Black Sea country faces security challenges. Along with Ukraine, the country failed to win a Membership Action Plan at the NATO summit in Bucharest this spring. Fried said Georgia's desire to join NATO has ""provoked a campaign of pressure from Russia,"" and listed actions Moscow has taken to punish the Georgian government, including the suspension of air and land links, and intensifying its relationship with separatist authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions, where Russian peacekeeping forces have been deployed since the early 1990s. ""These steps counter Russia's own professed policy of supporting Georgia's territorial integrity, damage Russia's role as a facilitator of the UN's mediating process in Abkhazia, and risk destabilizing the broader Caucasus region,"" Fried said. ""The United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and we hold that Abkhazia's status should be determined through a negotiated compromise. We've called on Moscow to reverse its unconstructive actions taken recently, and work with us and with others in a diplomatic process to resolve these conflicts."" On Armenia, Fried said geographic isolation, widespread corruption, and recent setbacks to democratic development have prompted the United States to make supporting Armenia's integration into the region ""a particular priority."" Solving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict would be a major step forward on that integration, he said. So would normalizing relations between Armenia and Turkey, which has imposed a blockade on Armenia since 1993, Fried said. Many members of the committee questioned Fried about what the United States is doing to help end the 15-year-old Turkish blockade of Armenia. The World Bank estimates that Turkey and Azerbaijan's blockades of Armenia reduce Armenia's GDP by up to 38 percent annually. Four U.S. House members recently introduced the ""End the Turkish Blockade of Armenia"" bill, which calls upon Turkey to end its blockade of Armenia. Fried said the United States supports a normalization of relations as well as the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border. ""Reconciliation will require political will on both sides and does require dealing with the sensitive and painful issues, including the issue of the mass killings and forced exile of up to 1.5 million Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire,"" Fried said. ""Turkey needs to come to terms with this history, and for its part, Armenia should acknowledge the existing border with Turkey and respond constructively to efforts that Turkey may make."" Armenian Genocide Debate Resurfaces In his description of the mass killings of more than a million Armenians by Turkish troops in 1915, Fried avoided the word ""genocide,"" in line with the Bush administration's policy. No U.S. president has ever used that politically charged word to describe the event, and the Armenian government and Armenian diaspora have lobbied hard throughout the years to change that. In October 2007, the House Foreign Relations Committee narrowly passed a resolution to officially describe the massacre as ""genocide,"" but the legislation was withdrawn when U.S.-Turkish relations quickly soured as a result. At this hearing, Representative Diane Watson (Democrat, California) -- who represents an area of California that is second only to Moscow in number of ethnic Armenians -- pressed Fried on whether the State Department has specifically instructed its officials not to use the term ""Armenian genocide"" even though it acknowledges that what happened was a mass, targeted killing of an ethnic group. Fried said the massacre is a ""matter of historical record"" and the United States does not deny what happened, but confirmed that U.S. officials do not use the term because to do so would ""not contribute to a reconciliation between Armenia and Turkey."" Watson pressed Fried several more times to go on the record and answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether the Bush administration considers what happened to be genocide. Fried continued to insist that it does not deny the massacre. Finally, Watson declared the exchange ""fruitless"" and turned off her microphone. As the hearing proceeded, tensions between Georgia and Russia over Abkhazia were flaring anew, drawing a warning from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev not to provoke his country's troops in the breakaway zone. On June 17, Georgian officials said they had detained four Russian peacekeepers transporting guided missiles near the western Georgian city of Zugdidi, outside the disputed territory. Russian officials denied the charge and a Georgian Interior Ministry official said the soldiers would be released because Georgia had no authority over them. But by late on June 18, Georgia had returned only the truck in which the soldiers were traveling. In a statement, the Kremlin said that Medvedev spoke by telephone with his Georgian counterpart, Mikheil Saakashvili, telling him the ""provocations were unacceptable."" The statement said that ""Saakashvili promised to sort the situation out"" and the two leaders agreed on the need to stay in touch ""with the aim of resolving existing problems and developing bilateral relations.""",,,

But some observers may doubt the sincerity of such statements, given that as of June 5, some 40 supporters of defeated presidential challenger Levon Ter-Petrossian remain in pretrial custody for their participation in the postelection violence in Yerevan on March 1-2.""I have repeatedly said and am still of the opinion that we must unify all forces of the society in order to direct their efforts toward solving the problems of our country, and I think no one doubts that these problems are numerous,"" Sarkisian affirmed in his June 9 address. ""I sincerely believe that that we can unite.... I think we should act in such a way that the public...will be able to participate, in a formal or informal format, in a discussion of the problems that worry them, to participate in processes necessary to advance our country,"" Noyan Tapan quoted him as saying. Sarkisian went on to solicit his interlocutors' proposals on how to ensure that the Public Chamber becomes a forum for ""sincere discussion"" and for generating ideas. Noyan Tapan did not list those persons present at the discussion, but the opposition daily ""Haykakan zhamanak"" on June 10 claimed that they all either expressed support for the government crackdown on the opposition or refrained from public comment on it. Plans for creating the public chamber, which will comprise both pro-government and opposition politicians and will focus on key domestic and foreign policy issues, were unveiled in late May, although a press release from Sarkisian's office quoted him as saying that even before the post-election violence he was planning to set up such a body. On May 23, Sarkisian's national security adviser, Garnik Isagulian, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Ter-Petrossian would be invited to nominate a representative to the chamber, but Ter-Petrossian aide Levon Zurabian promptly ruled out doing so as long as Ter-Petrossian's supporters remained in detention. One of the detained Ter-Petrossian associates, former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzumanian, spoke to RFE/RL's Armenian Service on June 6 at the maximum-security prison where he has been held since being taken into custody on March 10 and charged with organizing ""mass disturbances"" and seeking to ""usurp power."" Arzumanian said the charges against him were fabricated in response to orders handed down from the Armenian authorities. ""I am being persecuted for my political views, and that is why I refuse to give testimony or participate in any other investigative activity,"" Arzumanian told RFE/RL. ""This case is a bubble. There is not a single fact to substantiate the accusations. They are holding us hostage here until they see what happens next,"" he said, adding that government ""repression"" will not force the opposition forces grouped around Ter-Petrossian into submission. Arzumanian too affirmed that no dialogue is possible between the authorities and the opposition as long as opposition activists are ""illegally"" detained. On June 5, Tigran Ter-Yesayan, a lawyer representing some of the detained oppositionists, told Noyan Tapan that many of his clients have not yet been questioned, and the investigation into their cases is effectively frozen. On June 10, police in Yerevan finally tracked down and arrested Samvel Gevorgian, who headed one of Ter-Petrossian's regional campaign offices during the presidential election campaign and went into hiding following the violent clashes in Yerevan on March 1-2 between police and security forces and Ter-Petrossian supporters, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Like Ter-Petrossian, Gevorgian was one of the leaders of the 1988 campaign for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144604.html,Analysis Presidents Give Green Light For Continuation Of Karabakh Talks ,"June 12, 2008 10:26 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Serzh Sarkisian and Ilham Aliyev, met for one hour on June 6 on the sidelines of a CIS summit in St. Petersburg to discuss prospects for resolving the Karabakh conflict. It was the first such top-level meeting since Sarkisian's inauguration as president on April 9; Aliyev refused to meet with Sarkisian on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Bucharest several days earlier, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on March 31.The two presidents agreed on June 6 that their foreign ministers should continue the ongoing talks on ways to resolve the conflict on the basis of the so-called Madrid Proposals presented to the conflict sides in November 2007 by the three co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group. In an interview with Russia's Vesti-24 television on June 2, Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian characterized those proposals as ""a good basis for finding a solution to the conflict."" In addition, the co-chairs will travel to Armenia and Azerbaijan at the end of this month for further talks aimed at narrowing the differences between the two sides. Both Nalbandian and his Azerbaijani counterpart, Elmar Mammadyarov, described the June 6 talks to journalists as ""constructive"" and ""positive,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. On June 10, the website kavkaz-uzel.ru quoted Mammadyarov as saying that Sarkisian's approach differed slightly from that of his predecessor, Robert Kocharian, in terms of unspecified ""nuances."" The two ministers also explained on June 6 that the Madrid Proposals were not discussed during the talks, as the approach of both sides requires further evaluation. U.S. Minsk Group co-Chairman and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza made the similar point that the Madrid Proposals ""are simply proposals...and the two sides do not agree with them completely,"" the website day.az reported. ""They need to be perfected, and both the mediators and the presidents agreed to continue work to that end,"" Bryza continued.The written text of the Madrid Proposals has not been made public, but they are reportedly based on the so-called Basic Principles for resolving the conflict that the co-chairmen went public with two years ago. ""These principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh, with special modalities for Kelbacar and Lachin districts [separating Karabakh from Armenia proper],"" according to the text posted on June 28, 2006, on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan. ""Demilitarization of those territories would follow. A referendum or popular vote would be agreed, at an unspecified future date, to determine the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh."" ""An international peacekeeping force would be deployed,"" added the statement. ""A joint commission would be agreed to implement the agreement. International financial assistance would be made available for de-mining, reconstruction, resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the war-affected regions of Nagorno-Karabakh. The sides would renounce the use or threat of use of force, and international and bilateral security guarantees and assurances would be put in place.""In a June 5 interview with the Russian news agency Regnum, Bryza said the Minsk Group co-chairs see their task as ""developing an agreement or formula that would allow the two sides here -- Armenia and Azerbaijanis -- to agree on the status of Karabakh. I do not know what their agreement will be. All I know is that we need to try to get two sides to get to an agreement on status and that's going to take a long, long time."" Bryza acknowledged the risk involved in insisting that Armenian forces be withdrawn from the seven districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to Karabakh that they currently occupy before a firm agreement is reached on the unrecognized republic's future status vis-a-vis the Azerbaijan Republic, noting that the withdrawal will not happen unless the Armenian side feels it has secured from Azerbaijan a concession of comparable magnitude. Similarly, Bryza continued, on the Azerbaijani side there is a political risk to giving to Armenia what Armenia needs to agree to give back the territories.At the same time, Bryza stressed that an Armenian withdrawal would improve the security situation in the conflict zone and lessen the potential for a resumption of hostilities (such as took place in March of this year). He said that ""there are many elements of this peace plan that are attractive to Armenia,"" including the provision of a land corridor (the so-called Lachin corridor) connecting Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia. Such a land link is one of Armenia's three basic requirements from any potential peace plan. While Bryza continues to insist that any solution to the Karabakh conflict will require concessions from both sides, some Azerbaijani officials clearly believe that Baku is in a stronger position to resist any unpalatable concessions in the wake of the adoption in mid-March by the UN General Assembly of a resolution condemning the continued occupation by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani territory.Commenting on the June 5 St. Petersburg talks, Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Xazar Ibrahim told journalists in Baku on June 9 that resolution has given rise to ""a totally new situation."" He also stressed that discussion of Karabakh's final status should not begin until Armenian forces have withdrawn from all the Azerbaijani territory they currently control, and he implied that Baku will insist that the proposed referendum on Karabakh's final status should exclude any variant that would not preserve Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and that it might not even grant the disputed region autonomy within Azerbaijan. Like Bryza, Ibrahim did not mention any time frame for conducting such a referendum, but the online daily zerkalo.az on May 28 quoted former Russian Minsk Group Co-chairman Vladimir Kazimirov as saying that it should be held no later than five years after the signing of a formal settlement, rather than waiting for 10-15 years.Mammadyarov on June 10 inferred that Azerbaijan's commitment to resolving the conflict peacefully, rather than militarily, itself constitutes a concession, and that the only other concession it would agree to would be to grant Nagorno-Karabakh any conceivable level of autonomy within Azerbaijan. In that context, the example he cited was that of Tatarstan within the Russian Federation.Nalbandian for his part told journalists in Yerevan on June 11 that he considers it imperative that representatives of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic participate in the ""final stage"" of negotiations on resolving the conflict, Noyan Tapan reported.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144594.html,East Poll Finds Fear Of Free Speech In Former Soviet Countries ,"June 11, 2008 11:53 GMT",,,"When the Soviet Union broke up nearly two decades ago, many in the West held out high hopes for its successors. But several of these countries have shown signs of resistance to democratic reform, and the Gallup Organization has conducted two polls to gauge the feeling of the residents of these countries. The news isn't good: the percentage of respondents in 10 of 14 former Soviet countries surveyed who say most or many fellow countrymen are afraid to speak openly of their political opinions actually increased from 2006 to 2007.Gallup says that in half of the 14 former Soviet countries, this proportion is now a majority of poll respondents. These countries -- ranging from the highest to the lowest percentage -- are Tajikistan, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Lithuania, and Georgia.The reasons? Christopher Walker -- an analyst with the New York-based Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group -- says there are ""antidemocratic winds"" blowing throughout Eurasia.Walker tells RFE/RL that leaders in the former Soviet states are putting increasing pressure on key institutions for democratic development, including civil society, the freedom to associate, and, just as important, the news media and other information providers.""These indicators, which we've monitored very closely at Freedom House over the last several years, suggest that institutionally there have been pressures emerging that have really contributed to this feeling of muzzling one's views and self-censoring at a number of levels,"" Walker says.In Tajikistan, for example, nearly 70 percent of those polled spoke of their fears of expressing themselves politically. Gallup pointed to President Emomali Rahmon, who has consolidated power since he came to power 14 years ago and marginalized the country's political opposition.In Uzbekistan, Gallup found more than 55 percent of respondents feared speaking out on political issues. Walker says he's not surprised. In the past two years, he says, the nongovernmental organizations that ordinarily would serve as what he calls a ""mediating force,"" have been shut down, making matters even worse there.As for Georgia, Gallup cites the country's political turmoil over the past year. Walker says that during and after the country's state of emergency in late 2007, citizens may have felt reluctant to express their political views freely.But Walker says he expects that the recent presidential election, which President Mikheil Saakashvili won only narrowly, may encourage Georgians to express themselves more freely.""The hope is that the elections -- certainly the presidential election -- would open the door for a wider range of views and reduce the feelings that people in the country might have of not being able to express themselves without constraints,"" he says.The poll found not only that most respondents in these seven countries say they're reluctant to speak openly, but that the number of such respondents is growing. In Tajikistan and Armenia, for example, the percentage rose from about 50 percent in 2006 to nearly 70 percent in 2007.In Moldova, the percentage ranged from just over 50 percent in 2006 to more than 65 percent in 2007. In Azerbaijan, it rose from less than 50 percent in 2006 to 60 percent last year.And the largest increases came in Georgia -- from less than 30 percent in 2006 to nearly 55 percent in 2007 -- and in Lithuania -- from less than 30 percent in 2006 to nearly 55 percent in 2007.So how can such fears be allayed, if the governments in these countries wanted to encourage their people to take part more fully in their own governance? Walker suggests a reform that has become standard remedy for closed societies: open the spigots of communication.""There's been a real focus by dominant power holders to restrict the information arteries that are critical for free speech and freedom of association, and by this I'm referring to civil society and the media sector,"" he says. ""If you look at those institutions in particular, there should be a refocusing on the ways in which both local reformers and outside organizations can refocus their energies to ensure that the ability of these institutions can be safeguarded.""(The Gallup report can be found here.)",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144571.html,Analysis Are ArmenianTurkish Relations Headed For Breakthrough  Or Breakdown ,"June 06, 2008 13:12 GMT",,,"Since his inauguration less than two months ago, Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian has been hobbled by a daunting set of challenges, ranging from internal political tension that shows little sign of dissipating to a looming economic crisis driven by sharp price rises for food and energy that is only expected to worsen in coming months.Yet even against this backdrop of internal challenges, there have been recent signs suggesting a possible new opportunity for a breakthrough in Armenia's strained relationship with its western neighbor, Turkey. Even before his election as president, Sarkisian outlined his vision of how Armenian-Turkish relations could be positively transformed by Turkey's admission to the EU. In an article published in December 2006 in ""The Wall Street Journal,"" and again in an interview with the ""Financial Times"" one year later, Sarkisian expressed support for Turkey's bid for EU membership, albeit for purely pragmatic geopolitical reasons, suggesting that EU membership would make Turkey ""more predictable"" and thus strengthen Armenia's national security. In a positively worded message on February 21, Turkish President Abdullah Gul -- one of the first foreign heads of state to congratulate the new president -- expressed the hope that Sarkisian's election victory ""will permit the creation of the necessary environment for normalizing relations between the Turkish and Armenian peoples, who have proven over centuries they can live together in peace and harmony."" ""I sincerely hope that...an atmosphere based on reciprocal trust and cooperation can be established that will contribute to regional peace and prosperity,"" Gul added. A subsequent letter from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan last month similarly noted the need for a new ""dialogue"" with Armenia. In response, the new Armenian prime minister, Tigran Sarkisian (no relation to the president), was quick to ""reaffirm"" Armenia's desire for a ""constructive dialogue and the establishment of normal relations without preconditions."" This was also echoed in a second formal response from Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian, who admitted that earlier efforts to bring about an Armenian-Turkish rapprochement ""failed,"" and called for a fresh approach and ""new style"" to be followed by unspecified ""positive steps."" Speaking in Brussels on May 28 at a session of the North Atlantic Council, Nalbandian again stressed that Armenia sets no preconditions for the normalization of relations with Turkey. He further noted that the preamble to the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) Armenia signed with NATO in 2005 affirms that ""Armenia seeks normalization of relations with Turkey and is determined to pursue constructive dialogue, including direct talks with Turkey, towards this end."" At one level, the exchange of letters and professed readiness to embark on a new dialogue seemingly reflect a renewed sense of optimism, especially as Armenia has reiterated that it has no preconditions to any normalization of relations with Turkey. Yet such optimism -- if indeed it is sincere, and not pro forma -- could prove misplaced in light of a sobering record of earlier half-hearted diplomatic initiatives and ill-fated unofficial attempts at forging a common ground between the two countries. Over the past 15 years, there has been only minimal contact between Armenia and Turkey. That absence of formal relations stems from two main impediments: Turkey's support for Azerbaijan in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh and its reaction to attempts by the worldwide Armenian diaspora to obtain broad international recognition of what they call the Armenian genocide of 1915. These two factors have come to dominate Turkish policy regarding its small neighbor, resulting in the imposition of an economic blockade in 1993 and a stubborn refusal to even establish formal diplomatic relations. But to date Turkey has gained little from that policy and, in fact, has actually lost significant diplomatic and economic opportunities. Moreover, many Turkish officials have privately admitted that Turkish foreign policy regarding Armenia has become far too limited and seemingly hostage to Azerbaijan's implacable opposition to any improvement in relations with Armenia. Despite the poor record of past initiatives, the potential benefits from even the most basic and rudimentary form of engagement are clear for each country. For Turkey, opening its closed border with Armenia would constitute a new strategic opportunity for galvanizing economic activity in the impoverished eastern regions of the country, which could play a key role in the economic stabilization of the already restive largely Kurdish-populated eastern regions and thus address a significant national security imperative of countering the root causes of Kurdish terrorism and separatism with economic opportunity. Likewise, an open border with Turkey would offer Armenia not only a way to overcome its regional isolation and marginalization, but also a bridge to larger markets crucial for economic growth and development. In addition, the commercial and economic activity resulting from opening the Armenian-Turkish border would foster subsequent trade ties between the two countries that, in turn, would lead to more formal cooperation in the key areas of customs and border security. And with such a deepening of bilateral trade ties and cross-border cooperation, the establishment of normal diplomatic relations would undoubtedly follow. Thus, the opening of the closed Armenian-Turkish border could not only bring about a crucial breakthrough in fostering trade links and economic relations, but may also serve as an impetus to bolster broader stability and security throughout the conflict-prone South Caucasus. Yet the divide between potential and reality seems as wide as ever, as participants at a one-day conference on Armenian-Turkish relations in Yerevan on May 20 acknowledged. Organized by the Yerevan-based Analytical Center on Globalization and Regional Cooperation with the support of the Eurasia Partnership Foundation and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the conference brought together several leading Armenian and Turkish experts and analysts for an open discussion of the prospects for a normalization of relations between the two countries and helped to dispel some of the more disturbing stereotypes of Turks that have come to drive Armenian perceptions. As one of the participants later wrote in the May 22 issue of the ""Turkish Daily News,"" the conference was able to forge a shared recognition of ""a lack of clarity and a gap between declarations and practice on both sides."" Highlighting a new sense of optimism, Diba Nigar Goksel, a senior analyst at the European Stability Initiative and the editor in chief of the English-language ""Turkish Policy Quarterly,"" went on to stress that ""it also seemed hopeful that the sides could move closer to a shared view of history, as long as they set reasonable expectations,"" adding that ""sometimes it takes a trip eastward to appreciate how far Turkey has traveled and the untapped potential it has for more influence."" But at the same time, the conference seemed to confirm that any breakthrough in Armenian-Turkish relations hinges above all on timing, given that in the past each side has on more than one occasion extended a cautious hand to the other, but those overtures have never coincided. This divergence has also assumed a new political dimension, as the new Armenian government is in desperate need of a strategic breakthrough in foreign policy as it struggles to overcome the ongoing internal political crisis. Yet even this imperative for progress from the Armenian side is not enough to overcome the stalemate in relations, as the truly revolutionary degree of change now under way within Turkey suggests little likelihood for a breakthrough. And while the dynamic process of redefining and reassessing the very tenets of Turkey's national identity and strategic orientation may present a new opportunity for modifying its failed policy toward Armenia, Turkey seems wary of alienating its traditional ally, Azerbaijan. As recently as May 26, the Turkish daily ""Zaman"" quoted Economy Minister Mehmet Simsek as saying that the border with Armenia will not be opened until Yerevan solves its problems with Ankara and with Turkey's ""regional ally,"" Azerbaijan. Simsek added that Armenia has more to gain than Turkey from establishing ""normal relations"" between the two countries, and therefore Armenia should take the first step toward rapprochement. Therefore, while it may seem attractive to blame Turkey for failing to seize the initiative and reap the benefits from a fresh approach toward Armenia, the real impediment lies in Turkey's desire to allay Azerbaijani concerns, at least in the short term.",,,

In a written statement, Ter-Petrossian's Popular Movement, an umbrella structure uniting more than two dozen opposition groups, offered to cooperate with the municipal authorities and the Armenian police in maintaining public order during the planned rally. Senior Ter-Petrossian aide Levon Zurabian told journalists that the organizers will formally ask the Yerevan mayor to authorize the gathering. But he made it clear they will urge supporters to converge on the city's Liberty Square even if that application is rejected. The date of the planned demonstration is just three days before the start of the June session of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) that will discuss Yerevan's compliance with a PACE resolution adopted in mid-April on the political situation in Armenia. One of the key demands of the resolution is the repeal of controversial legal amendments that enable the authorities to ban antigovernment street protests practically at will. The authorities have been keen to thwart such protests since the deadly March 1 clashes between security forces and thousands of Ter-Petrossian supporters protesting against official results of the disputed presidential election. The violence left at least 10 people dead and nearly 200 others injured, leading to the imposition of a 20-day state of emergency in the capital. The authorities initially maintained their de facto ban on opposition protests even after the end of emergency rule by enacting controversial amendments to the law on public gatherings, but in response to Western pressure, the Armenian parliament passed in the first reading in late May a bill easing those restrictions. Council of Europe officials have welcomed the move. However, the Ter-Petrossian camp insisted on June 3 that the changes are ""cosmetic."" Its statement said the administration of President Serzh Sarkisian has also failed to meet other demands included in the PACE resolution such as the launch of an independent inquiry into the March 1 violence and the release of political prisoners. Speaking at a news conference on June 3, Zurabian would not say what the Ter-Petrossian-led opposition will do if the police again cordon off Liberty Square and surrounding streets in the city center. He said only that the opposition would hold the authorities responsible for any ensuing violence. On May 30, Ter-Petrossian's movement praised the revised and final assessment of the February presidential election released by the Organization for Security and cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Whereas the initial assessment made public shortly after the ballot was largely positive, the final report concluded that serious irregularities during the vote count and recount ""devalued the overall election process."" ""While the 2008 presidential election mostly met OSCE commitments and international standards in the preelection period and during voting hours, serious challenges to some commitments did emerge, especially after election day,"" according to the OSCE final assessment. ""This displayed an insufficient regard for standards essential to democratic elections and devalued the overall election process. In particular, the vote count demonstrated deficiencies of accountability and transparency, and complaints and appeals procedures were not fully effective."" ""The OSCE has effectively abandoned its previous evaluations legitimizing Armenia's recent presidential elections, as the Popular Movement demanded,"" the opposition said in a statement commenting on the OSCE assessment. That statement said the OSCE observers' initial conclusion that the presidential ballot was administered ""mostly in accordance"" with democratic standards only emboldened the authorities to use lethal force against opposition protesters. ""Had the evaluations been objective right from the beginning, the regime would not have dared to take the criminal step of slaughtering its own people,"" it claimed.",,,0

The report helps determine whether the United States imposes sanctions or other punishments on countries that are seen as not doing enough to fight the practice. The report puts countries in one of three levels, or ""tiers,"" that represent how well the United States views such efforts: Tier 1 for those doing a good job, down to Tier 3 for those doing an unacceptable job. Virtually all of the nations of Eastern, Central, and Southeastern Europe are in Tier 2, while Russia and Tajikistan are on the so-called ""watch list"" of Tier-2 countries because they could slip to Tier 3. Uzbekistan is among four countries that have moved up. It used to be designated as a Tier-3 country, and now is on the Tier-2 ""watch list."" Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are in Tier 2, except for Turkmenistan, which is listed as a ""special case"" because of the lack of information from the country. Georgia in classified as Tier 1, while Armenia and Azerbaijan are on Tier-2 ""watch lists."" Afghanistan is classified as Tier 2. Iraq and Kosovo are listed as ""special cases"" due to their political transitions. On May 29, the UN issued a report declaring that the rate of crimes against people and property in the Balkans has improved to the point that the Balkans are considered safer than Western Europe. But the State Department report says human trafficking remains a problem in the Balkans, particularly in Moldova. ""Moldova fell to Tier 3 for the first time, reflecting its government's failure to tackle trafficking-related corruption, as reflected in the handling of several high-profile cases of complicity by government officials in trafficking,"" said Mark Lagon, the State Department's senior adviser on trafficking in persons. ""This failure created a significant impediment to the government's ability to fight trafficking overall."" May Lose Financial Assistance Lagon said the State Department hopes the new government in Moldova will root out corrupt officials, improve the country's weak law enforcement, and make other efforts to protect victims of human trafficking. Until then, Moldova -- along with Fiji and Papua New Guinea -- may lose some U.S. financial assistance that isn't involved in trade or humanitarian aid. In releasing the report, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice noted that since the United States began issuing the annual reports in 2000, an increasing number of governments around the world have given greater attention the problem of human trafficking. ""Today -- because of our efforts, the efforts of our allies, and reports like the one we are releasing today -- there is much greater global awareness about the brutality of human trafficking,"" she said. ""Globally, human trafficking is a multidimensional threat. It deprives people of their human rights and dignity, it increases global health risks, it bankrolls the growth of organized crime, and it undermines the rule of law."" But Rice said the more governments delve into the problem, the more trouble they find. Certainly, she said, traffickers have always found ways to kidnap and transport people for labor and prostitution, and there's never been a shortage of victims in regions such as Southeastern Europe, India, China, and the Philippines. But Rice said that even in countries where such practices are uncovered, the people responsible for this 21st-century slavery too often go free. ""For the first time, in this year's report we closely examined prosecution data and made a disturbing discovery,"" Rice said. ""Although more countries are addressing sex trafficking through prosecution and convictions, the petty tyrants who exploit their laborers rarely receive serious punishment. We see this as a serious shortcoming, and as we move our efforts forward, we and our allies must remember that a robust law enforcement response is essential."" NGOs Not Properly Trained What's equally disturbing is that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) -- which frequently offer the first refuge for victims who manage to escape the traffickers -- aren't trained or otherwise equipped to handle the victims. Lagon said that last winter he met two young Romanian women at a shelter in Bucharest for survivors of sex trafficking in Western Europe. They finally escaped to the care of an NGO in the West, then were repatriated to the Bucharest shelter. But Lagon said that once the two women were back in their native country, one was eventually found to have an advanced case of tuberculosis, and the other was suffering from severe syphilis. ""Why weren't these women given proper medical attention before they were repatriated? The time loss made their conditions immensely worse,"" Lagon said. ""Despite increased attention by law enforcement to sex trafficking, we are not seeing -- as the findings of this report [show] -- significant victim protection and victim services provided. This trend has to be reversed or we'll never be able to help significant numbers of victims become survivors. The dehumanized must be restored to their full humanity."" Lagon said the purpose of the report is to diagnose the problem of human trafficking and, from year to year, to track progress -- or lack thereof -- in combating it. In compiling the report, he said, he's highlighted five trends in worldwide human trafficking that need special attention by governments. ""Weak prosecution of labor-trafficking offenses. Secondly, weak trafficking-victim protection. Third, forced labor creeping into new growth industries. Fourth, domestic servitude, and luckily problems there are gaining recognition,"" Lagon said. ""And fifth, closing a window of vulnerability for migrant workers is an imperative."" But Lagon said the thread that unites these five trends is something even more disturbing -- the demand for slave laborers and sex workers.",,,

(Photolur) In recent days, Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian has dismissed both the head of the State Protection Service, Girgory Sarkisian (to whom he is not related) and national police chief Lieutenant General Hayk Harutiunian in what some observers believe is an attempt to distance himself from men who played a key role in the crackdown in Yerevan on March 1-2 on opposition demonstrators protesting the perceived falsification of the February 19 presidential ballot. At least 10 people died during or as a result of injuries received in that crackdown. by Ruzanna Khachatrian and Emil DanielianOther commentators, however, suggest that President Sarkisian has begun a methodical purge of senior officials with close ties to his predecessor, Robert Kocharian. The presidential administration issued a statement on May 27 announcing Grigory Sarkisian's dismissal, but did not offer any explanation for it. Sarkisian, who has headed the State Protection Service, which is responsible for the personal security of the country's most senior officials, since it was founded in 2004, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that he tendered his resignation several days previously ""because the president wanted it,"" and that he will be named to another, unspecified position. Asked whether he might head the police force, he replied, ""probably not."" Grigory Sarkisian was born and grew up in the then-Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, as was former President Kocharian, to whom he reportedly has close ties. He earlier served as head of Kocharian's bodyguard.Unconfirmed press reports claim that he is increasingly at odds with a third Karabakh Armenian, Vahe Ghazarian, who has long been responsible for Serzh Sarkisian's personal security. Grigory Sarkisian was present when police set about expelling opposition protesters from Liberty Square in Yerevan early on March 1, and former President and defeated presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian claims that Sarkisian served as mediator in talks between Kocharian and Ter-Petrossian later on March 1 that failed to prevent the renewed clashes that evening.On May 29, Sarkisian issued a decree firing Harutiunian, who was named interior minister in the wake of the October 1999 parliament shootings, but stripped of his ministerial status three years later while retaining responsibility for the police force. Again, no reason was cited for Harutiunian's dismissal.Sarkisian named to succeed Harutiunian as police chief Alik Sargsian, who occupied senior positions within the police departments in Yerevan and the southern region of Ararat prior to his appointment as Ararat regional governor in 2000. Sargsian is said to be close to presidential chief of staff Hovik Abrahamian, whose regional power base is Ararat.",,,

On May 23, Armenia's Court of Appeals upheld three-year prison sentences handed down to Ter-Petrossian supporters Simon Amirkhanian and Samvel Karapetian, who were sentenced last month for alleged interference in the vote count at a polling station in Gavar, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. The court similarly upheld verdicts against three Ter-Petrossian election campaign activists sentenced to between 18 and 30 months in prison on charges of assaulting a pro-government heckler during a campaign rally in the town of Talin, and on May 26 against Hovannes Harutiunian, a Ter-Petrossian proxy sentenced to 18 months in prison on charges of illegal possession of ammunition.The Abovian municipal court on May 23 sentenced Sos Gevorgian to one year in jail on charges of illegal possession of weapons, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Gevorgian's uncle Sasun Mikaelian is one of three opposition parliamentarians charged with plotting to overthrow the Armenian leadership in the wake of the disputed February 19 vote. Meanwhile, the Armenian authorities are planning to deport Zhirayr Sefilian, a prominent Lebanese-Armenian oppositionist jailed in late 2006. Sefilian and a fellow Karabakh war veteran, Vartan Malkhasian, were arrested in December 2006 just days after founding an unofficial pressure group opposed to resolving the Karabakh conflict through territorial concessions to Azerbaijan. They too were charged with calling for the violent overthrow of the Armenian government. A Yerevan court found Malkhasian guilty of that charge and sentenced him in August 2007 to two years in prison; Sefilian was acquitted on that charge but found guilty and sentenced to 18 months in prison for illegal possession of arms. His sentence is due to end on June 9.Both Sefilian and Malkhasian claim they were jailed for their pledge to fight to prevent fraud during the May 2007 parliamentary elections, and both subsequently endorsed Ter-Petrossian's presidential bid. Sefilian's defense lawyer Vahe Grigorian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that deporting Sefilian would be illegal as he has two underage children. Sefilian has appealed to Bako Sahakian, president of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, to grant him political asylum there, according to Arminfo on May 22. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation--Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), one of the four parties represented in the coalition government, has informed President Sarkisian of its objections to the decision, first to deny Sefilian citizenship of the Republic of Armenia, which he has twice applied for, and then to deport him, HHD bureau head Hrant Markarian told journalists in Yerevan on May 27, Noyan Tapan reported. On May 28, Armenia's Administrative Court rejected the police request to endorse Sefilian's deportation on the grounds that it was incorrectly phrased, according to Noyan Tapan.Meeting on May 24 with President Sarkisian in Yerevan, three visiting members of the U.S. House of Representatives -- Adam Schiff (Democrat, California), Wayne Gilchrest (Republican, Maryland), and Allyson Schwartz (Democrat, Pennsylvania), all of them members of the House Democracy Assistance Commission -- expressed their shared concern about the ongoing postelection crackdown, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on May 26. ""We are concerned with the problems that occurred during the election, the violence that occurred after the election,"" Schiff told RFE/RL after the talks. ""We consider ourselves very strong friends of Armenia. We want a good and successful future for Armenia, a democratic Armenia.... So we are here to try to assess the situation and talk with the Armenian government about how we can help move the government further in the direction of democracy,"" he said.Specifically, Schiff stressed U.S. concerns that at least some of those detained and sentenced in the wake of the postelection protests and the violent clashes on March 1-2 in Yerevan between police and security forces and Ter-Petrossian supporters were targeted purely because of their political affiliation. ""We've raised concern about the detention of anyone who was detained for political reasons, and we certainly hope that the government addresses these issues,"" he said. ""No one is advocating that people that committed violent crimes be released or not be subject to trial. But people should not be detained or put to trial for merely expressing their views.""The pro-Ter-Petrossian daily ""Haykakan zhamanak"" noted on May 24 that U.S. President George W. Bush has still not congratulated Sarkisian on his election as president. The overall pattern of repression has, however, been tempered by two positive moves on the part of the authorities. On May 23, Sarkisian's national-security adviser, Garnik Isagulian, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Ter-Petrossian will be invited to nominate a representative to Sarkisian's planned public chamber, which will comprise both pro-government and opposition politicians and will focus on key domestic and foreign-policy issues. Isagulian said he would call Ter-Petrossian's office personally ""and try to agree terms with them,"" and then, assuming the invitation was not rejected out of hand, meet personally with Ter-Petrossian's staff to repeat the offer.But Levon Zurabian, Ter-Petrossian's former presidential spokesman, told RFE/RL the same day that Ter-Petrossian will not embark on any talks with the authorities as long as his supporters remain in jail, as doing so would mean that ""the authorities have drawn us into the hostage trade...they would seek to extract a concession from us in exchange for the release of every hostage.""On May 26, state prosecutors agreed in what was termed a goodwill gesture to release opposition Nor Zhamanakner (New Times) party leader Aram Karapetian from pretrial detention, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Karapetian was arrested on February 24 for having circulated DVDs on which he posed incriminating questions to both Kocharian and Sarkisian, and hospitalized with heart problems on May 15.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144518.html,EU New Initiative Suggests East Is Edging Out South In Neighborhood Tussle ,"May 30, 2008 12:00 GMT",,,"Poland Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski is all smiles after tabling his Eastern Partnership initiative in Brussels on May 26 (AFP) BRUSSELS -- The so-called Eastern Partnership initiative may well come to mark the point when the European Union's center of gravity shifted decisively to the east. Initial reactions to the Polish-Swedish proposal, unveiled on May 26 at an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels, suggests the East is edging out the South in the struggle for recognition among the bloc's neighbors. The initiative has effectively short-circuited what has come to be known as the ""borders of Europe"" debate within the EU. Stockholm and Warsaw have forced the major players in the bloc to admit, at least tacitly, that their eastern neighbors -- Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan -- are all located in Europe. According to the principles laid out in the EU's own founding document, the Rome Treaty, they are legally eligible to apply for EU membership, should they so wish. True, in the short term, the Eastern Partnership idea may not go beyond tinkering with the practical workings of the existing European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), currently a catchall for the EU's various neighbors. But Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has left little doubt that sooner or later, the entire concept of the ENP must change. As he told his EU colleagues in Brussels on May 26, the EU has ""European neighbors"" in the east, whereas to the south, there are just ""neighbors of Europe."" Many observers agree that Poland and Sweden are forcing the EU to admit the obvious -- that the bloc's eastern neighbors cannot forever be denied a shot at EU membership. Even Germany and France, both skeptical of further enlargement, are coming around to the view that it may serve the EU's interests to acknowledge eastern ambitions sooner rather than later. European Identity, Aspirations Michael Emerson, a senior analyst with the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies, says Sikorski is essentially stating the obvious. ""Fundamentally, it is uncontroversial that the eastern neighbors -- which are all members of the Council of Europe -- have a certain European identity and aspirations and perspectives, possibly, for some of them,"" Emerson says. ""Whereas that is not the case for the Mediterranean Arab states."" Obvious it may be, but so far, the continental ""old"" member states -- afflicted as they are by enlargement fatigue -- have been loath to admit this. Still, this is changing. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, foreign minister of the EU's largest member state, Germany, spoke of the Eastern Partnership with approval on May 26. He said the EU has ""every interest"" in stabilizing Eastern Europe. He added, however, that that does not necessarily mean preparing its countries for accession. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said after the meeting that ""it is no sin to go east and south at the same time."" France has so far championed the EU's southern neighbors, securing for them two-thirds of the 12 billion euros earmarked for the ENP between 2007-13. (ENP participants include Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Syria, Tunisia, and Ukraine.) France's role is all the more significant as it will hold the next EU Presidency between July and December. Major Gesture Toward Ukraine There are suggestions that France is trying to placate eastern member states in order to win support for its own Mediterranean Union for the southern neighbors, endorsed by EU leaders in March. But there are signs Paris may have more noble motives. Diplomats in Brussels say France is preparing a major gesture during its presidency toward Ukraine, which has long claimed it is more than a mere neighbor. ""During the French presidency, we will be very open, especially for Ukraine, because we would like to get out of this negative position [the EU] had in the past,"" says Michel Foucher, a former senior French diplomat and currently a member of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a French think tank. ""And we think it's important to have a kind of open-door policy toward Ukraine, which is not to make decisions, not prescribe [solutions], but not to exclude [anything], if I may say so."" Ukraine, which is presently negotiating a new partnership accord with the EU, wants an Association Agreement. All new Eastern European member states had Association Agreements with the EU before they were given candidate status. Foucher said an Association Agreement is one option, adding that Paris at this stage is leaning toward the formulation ""privileged partnership."" This would evoke uneasy echoes of Turkey's travails, which is being offered just such a designation as an alternative to full EU membership. But according to Foucher, the idea that eastern neighbors are ""European"" and therefore theoretically eligible for EU membership is ""uncontroversial"" in Paris. ""The problem,"" he says -- mentioning Belarus, Armenia, and Azerbaijan by name -- ""is the timing and internal political situation"" of some of the countries. Attitudes Toward East Changing German analysts also bear out the impression that attitudes toward the East are changing on the continent. Joerg Himmelreich, a senior trans-Atlantic fellow at the German Marshall Foundation, says Berlin sees ""no problem"" in the idea that Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the South Caucasus belong to Europe. He says Germany has acted with caution, however, for fear of upsetting France. ""So far, it was always concern for France, [which caused] Germany to hesitate to pursue a more active integration and accession policy toward the eastern European neighborhood,"" Himmelreich says. ""And it is right, [therefore], that now the Polish foreign minister is taking up this [objective]."" Himmelreich suggests the Polish-Swedish initiative -- spearheaded by Sikorski and his Swedish counterpart, Carl Bildt -- may be viewed as serving as a proxy for Germany's own long-term interests, which Berlin is presently unable to act on. Himmelreich says the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats in the current German governing coalition are blocking ""all of each other's foreign-policy initiatives."" The situation is likely to remain at an impasse until the next federal parliamentary elections in December 2009. Himmelreich says Foreign Minister Steinmeier's Ostpolitik is ""fading."" Jan Techau, head of the Alfred von Oppenheim-Center for European Studies in Germany, notes the Eastern Partnership initiative addresses a plan left over from Germany's EU presidency in the first half of 2007. At the time, Germany spearheaded the launch of a Black Sea Synergy initiative, designed to engage the eastern neighbors, as well as Russia and Turkey. The idea, however, has stalled. Both Techau and Himmelreich suggest Germany will at some point overcome its present preoccupation with Russia -- which vies for primacy in the post-Soviet space -- and become more assertive in pursuing its own interests in the East. Himmelreich predicts this will be accompanied by a more active German stance in Georgia. Larger Realignment It seems hardly a coincidence that the Eastern Partnership initiative was unveiled on May 26, the same day EU foreign ministers approved strategic partnership talks with Russia. The Polish-Swedish proposal appears to be part of a larger realignment of the EU's Ostpolitik, which could lead to a more active stance in the future. This seems to involve encouragement by Berlin and Paris for a leading role for Poland among the new member states, even if under some notional Swedish tutelage. Poland's first test was the normalization of relations with Russia. It dropped its 18-month veto on the EU-Russia talks and negotiated an end to a subsequent Lithuanian veto. In return, Poland is being conspicuously consulted by France and Germany when it comes to contacts with Russia. After a four-day tour of Russia in mid-May, Germany's Steinmeier met Sikorski for a friendly lunch on May 25. And French President Nicolas Sarkozy was in Poland on May 28, just one day before a visit to Paris by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144498.html,Azerbaijan Newfound Wealth Hardens Bakus Bargaining Position On Karabakh ,"May 27, 2008 07:35 GMT",,,"Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov (Turan) To hear Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister tell it, the longstanding conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is fairly ""easy"" to resolve -- all Armenia has to do is accept that the region is Azerbaijani territory and all other negotiating chips will fall into place. Araz Azimov's statements, made during an exclusive interview with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service this week, reflect Baku's increased standing as a result of rising global oil prices and strengthened position ahead of negotiations between the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents scheduled for June 7 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Azimov says that after allowing Armenia's newly elected President Serzh Sarkisian and his government time to consider its course of policy on Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku is working from the understanding that ""Armenia is ready to continue talks on the settlement issues."" However, the deputy foreign minister adds, ""this readiness should be based on something."" ""Whatever different elements are under consideration, all of them in the end, logically and unavoidably, come out to one issue: this conflict is to be solved within the territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan -- period,"" Azimov says. Once Armenia was willing to accept this condition, Azimov predicts, the negotiation process would follow a logical, step-by-step process that ""will take us to the next stage."" The elaboration of concrete proposals, he says, will open the way for military-technical measures that lead to the end of Armenia's occupation of Azerbaijani territories. That, according to Azimov, will free things up for the rehabilitation of those territories and, in turn, provide for the return of the population of these territories, ""including the return of Azeris"" to Nagorno-Karabakh. Once the two peoples are ""tasting the fruit"" of mutual cooperation and coexistence, they will be ready to decide their future, he says. ""Then, within that new environment of peace and security, they will be able to participate within the legal and democratic process that will establish the status of the [Nagorno-Karabakh] region,"" Azimov says. Azimov's statements make crystal clear that Baku considers the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly in May upholding the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan as the starting point for any negotiations. But the deputy foreign minister's comments also distance Azerbaijan from international calls for the two sides to agree on an interim status for the disputed region until a referendum can be held sometime in the future. The OSCE Minsk Group, which is mediating the settlement negotiations, has had difficulties getting the two sides to sign off on what it calls the ""fundamental principles"" of a settlement. The principles, in general, call for the gradual liberation of Azerbaijani districts occupied by Armenian forces, the deployment of peacekeepers, the repatriation of Armenians, and the return of Azerbaijanis who were internally displaced as a result of the 1988-94 war. In March, OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs Russia, France, and the United States reiterated their support for the ""territorial integrity of Azerbaijan"" and stated that they ""therefore do not recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh, while holding that the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh is a matter of negotiations between the parties."" The co-chairs also stated that any settlement will require ""unavoidable compromises among the parties,"" and expressed their hope for a resumption of negotiations for a settlement of the conflict bases on the fundamental principles. Meanwhile, Armenian President Sarkisian told a meeting of EU ambassadors on May 22 that ""the possibilities for solution of the conflict still exist, if the talks based on fundamental principles continue,"" according to Interfax. Armenia's foreign minister, who said the same day that he hopes ""for a positive meeting between the presidents that will make it possible for us to continue the negotiating process on the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts,"" spent May 26 briefing a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation on the situation. Meanwhile, in his interview with RFE/RL, Azimov left his Armenian counterparts with something to think about. Touting Azerbaijan's recent economic success and ""participation in international life,"" he boasts that ""Armenia is not where Azerbaijan is today."" ""To reach that point, to where Azerbaijan is today, they have to do a lot -- they have to get the ticket to the train -- the train of legality, of peace, of good-neighborhood,"" Azimov says. ""If they want to be good neighbors to Azerbaijan, they have to respect territorial integrity."" This, he says, is what Azerbaijan expects from the new president of Armenia; if not, Yerevan ""will get something different than what Azerbaijan seeks."" The implication is that Armenia could find itself trying to match oil-rich Azerbaijan in another area: Baku is spending more than $2 billion on defense this year -- more than Armenia's entire national budget -- and is displaying much of its new military hardware for the country's Armed Forces Day on June 26.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1144495.html,EU Poland Sweden Breathe New Life Into Eastern Neighborhood ,"May 26, 2008 12:42 GMT",,,"Poland's Sikorski said the new program will hold out hope of future membership (RFE/RL) BRUSSELS -- Poland and Sweden have floated a plan to set up a new EU ""Eastern Partnership"" for Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The initiative, unveiled at an EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, seeks to reinforce the bloc's ties with its eastern neighbors -- with a view to putting at least some of them on the path to EU membership.It also reflects growing concerns among the EU's newer member states that the bloc is neglecting its eastern neighbors.Speaking ahead of the EU foreign ministers meeting at the European Policy Center on May 26, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said closer ties with countries like Ukraine and Moldova are hampered by what he called ""enlargement fatigue"" within the EU.The EU's current European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) makes no distinction between the bloc's eastern and southern neighbors. (ENP participants include Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Syria, Tunisia, and Ukraine.) Crucially, the ENP is designed to remain noncommittal about countries' future membership prospects.This is a circumstance Poland wants to change. Sikorski said Warsaw and Stockholm are looking for an ""ideological"" enhancement of the ENP.""We in Poland make a distinction between the southern dimension and the eastern dimension [of the ENP] and it consists in this -- to the south, we have neighbors of Europe, to the east we have European neighbors,"" Sikorski said. He said that this constitutes ""a big difference. These are countries -- Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova -- whose entire territories lie in Europe, and by the provisions of the [EU's founding] Treaty of Rome they all have the right one day to apply, to fulfill the criteria [for EU membership], and, perhaps, to become members.""Meanwhile, the EU's southern member states have secured two-thirds of the 12 billion euros ($18.9 billion) available to the ENP between 2007-13 for North African countries -- although they have already been deemed ineligible for EU membership. France is spearheading efforts to set up a ""Mediterranean Union"" to coordinate EU cooperation with the southern neighbors.Sikorski said the Eastern Partnership would be one of the main priorities of the EU's Polish presidency in 2011. But the initiative is likely to kick off even sooner.Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra told journalists as he arrived at the Brussels meeting that the Czech EU presidency in 2009 will also work to ""balance"" the EU's eastern and southern dimensions.""We support this Polish-Swedish initiative very much,"" Vondra said. ""It goes in the same direction that we want. And we see that the next year, we need to balance. This year, it is a Mediterranean year. So, the next year would be the eastern year.""Grand Bargain Within EUDiplomats say the EU's larger member states -- who often oppose the smaller ""new"" states over issues related to the former Soviet space -- are supportive of the Eastern Partnership initiative. France, which will take over as the next EU presidency in July, is motivated by the need to build support for its Mediterranean strategy among the eastern member states. Germany traditionally takes a close interest in the EU's eastern policy, while Britain is traditionally one of the staunchest supporters of continued enlargement.It also appears the Polish-Swedish initiative is part of a grand bargain within the EU that has seen Lithuania formally drop its objections to an EU-Russia strategic partnership deal. EU foreign ministers have agreed that the long-delayed talks with Russia can begin at the EU-Russia summit at Khanty-Mansiisk on June 26-27.Significantly, Poland and Sweden led the EU mediating effort earlier this month when Lithuania first stepped in to veto the talks. Vilnius's concerns -- ranging from trade complaints, the status of criminal investigations, and Russia's recent aggressive moves in Georgia -- are now to be addressed in the course of the EU-Russia negotiations.The Polish-Swedish initiative is unlikely to bring with it an immediate sea change in the EU's eastern policy. Reflecting the weight of the consensus within the bloc, the EU's external relations commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said on May 26 that she does not think it is a good idea to introduce distinctions between the eastern and southern neighbors.Instead, Ferrero-Waldner said the Eastern Partnership initiative would need to show it can ""add value"" to the existing Neighborhood Policy. ""In Eastern Europe, indeed, there are some issues which can suitably be addressed at a regional level -- for instance, on energy, transport networks, maybe cooperation on trafficking, [cooperation] against illegal immigration,"" she said.Ferrero-Waldner appeared particularly concerned the new plan could interfere with the EU's ""Black Sea Synergy"" scheme announced last year -- which also involves Russia and Turkey.Poland's Sikorski also stressed the importance of practical cooperation, but in a subtly different sense. He said Ukraine, Moldova, and eventually Belarus would be well-advised to follow the example of the Visegrad group, which was set up by Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary to pursue regional cooperation before those countries were granted entry into the EU. Sikorski noted that while eastern membership hopefuls ""cannot change the rules of accession, they can change the perceptions"" in the EU if they demonstrate an ability to work together and reform. This, in turn, could stand them in good stead when the EU ""catches its breath"" and recovers from the current enlargement fatigue.",,,
,E,https://www.rferl.org/a/1117535.html,Analysis RussianArmenian Gas Talks Inconclusive ,"May 23, 2008 11:38 GMT",Russian gas giant Gazprom doubles gas price for Armenia,,"By Emil Danielian and Liz Fuller http://gdb.rferl.org/518D8E4F-0487-45FD-BB5C-551ECC14309E_w203.jpg Where will Armenia get its energy now? (ITAR-TASS) The Armenian government and Russia's Gazprom energy giant have failed to reach a final agreement on the price of Russian natural gas for Armenia, which is due to rise significantly next year. The issue dominated talks in Yerevan on May 19 between President Serzh Sarkisian and Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian (no relation to Serzh), and visiting Gazprom CEO Aleksei Miller. Both Tigran Sarkisian and Energy Minister Armen Movsisian refused to comment on the talks when approached by RFE/RL on May 20. In January 2006, Gazprom nearly doubled the price of the gas it supplied Armenia, from $54 to $110 per thousand cubic meters. However, the cost for Armenian corporate and individual consumers remained virtually unchanged until this month due to a controversial April 2006 agreement that left more Armenian energy assets under Russian ownership. In particular, Gazprom consolidated its controlling stake in Armenia's gas-distribution network and paid $249 million for an incomplete but modern thermal power plant located in the central town of Hrazdan. By contrast, Gazprom raised the gas price for Georgia and Azerbaijan from $60 to $110 in early 2006, and again in November of that year to $230 per thousand cubic meters as of January 2007.The Armenian government has since used the money from the sale of the Hrazdan facility to subsidize gas prices, but admitted last month that those funds are almost exhausted and that subsidies would end as of May 1. This resulted in a 50 percent increase in the retail price of gas supplied to Armenian households and business entities. With another Gazprom price hike planned for January 2009, they will likely go up further. Karen Karapetian, chairman of the board of the Armenian natural-gas distribution company ArmRosGazprom, was quoted by Noyan Tapan on April 16 as downplaying the impact of the price hike on consumers. He said the 89,000 households that currently use up to 300 cubic meters per month will only pay an additional 700 drams ($2.20), while those consuming between 300-500 cubic meters will pay an additional 1,000-1,100 drams. The tariff for commercial consumers will remain unchanged at $159 per thousand cubic meters (compared with $257-$283 in neighboring Georgia.)Gazprom said last week that by 2011, Armenia will have to pay for Russian gas at world prices that are currently above $200 per thousand cubic meters. According to the press offices of the Armenian president and prime minister, Miller reaffirmed this during his meetings in Yerevan. President Sarkisian's office said the two sides have agreed that the gas price will be raised to that level ""step by step."" In doing that, it said, they will take into account the fact that Gazprom now owns 72 percent of ArmRosGazprom. A separate statement by the Armenian government said the first increase will come into effect on January 1, 2009. It said Miller and Prime Minister Sarkisian agreed that the extent of that price rise will be determined by Gazprom and the Armenian side through further negotiations that will be held within the ""shortest possible period."" ""The parties expressed confidence that a final decision on the issue under discussion will be taken soon,"" the statement added.The increased cost of natural gas has added to inflationary pressures on the Armenian economy mainly resulting from rising international prices of fuel, wheat, and other imported foodstuffs. Russian gas has become the No. 1 source of winter heating for the population. It is also widely used, in liquefied and pressurized forms, by public transport and private cars.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1117534.html,Analysis Armenian Coalition Partner Lambastes Former President ,"May 23, 2008 11:23 GMT",,,"Markarian blamed the violence in Yerevan on March 1-2 squarely on the opposition protesters (AFP) Addressing on May 21 a congress in Yerevan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD) whose governing bureau he heads, Hrant Markarian argued that the street protests in Yerevan in the wake of the disputed February 19 presidential election were part of a Western plot to stage a ""colored revolution"" as in Georgia or Ukraine, and that the police crackdown on supporters of former President and defeated presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian was therefore fully justified, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. ""What happened in the country [in the wake of the election] was an attempt at a colored revolution,"" Markarian said in a speech to hundreds of congress delegates, many from HHD structures in the worldwide Armenian diaspora. ""Under our noses there was formed an organized mechanism or, as they like to say, a network similar to [the ones created in] other states: Georgia, Serbia, Ukraine. It was formed with foreign orders and funding,"" and with the express objective of bringing Ter-Petrossian to power, Markarian alleged. He further defended the HHD's decision to remain part of a government which its presidential candidate strongly criticized during the election campaign. Markarian cited the need to help the administration of new President Serzh Sarkisian cope with the external challenges facing Armenia. ""As long as that danger is there, our being in the coalition is justified,"" he argued.Markarian laid the blame for the violent clashes in Yerevan on March 1-2 between Ter-Petrossian supporters and police and security forces squarely on Ter-Petrossian, who as president in late 1994 banned the HHD and had dozens of its members, including Markarian, arrested on tenuous charges of involvement in a terrorist organization, the existence of which was never proved. Markarian spent three years in jail before being released in early 1997. Commenting on Ter-Petrossian's election campaign speeches, Markarian claimed that ""he didn't come to wage a program-based and ideological struggle.... Rallying the headless opposition masses around him, he created an atmosphere in which ethical norms of struggle gave way to destruction, slander, hatred, and demagoguery."" Markarian implied that Ter-Petrossian's animadversions contributed to the poor election showing of HHD presidential candidate Vahan Hovannisian, who polled fourth with a little over 6 percent of the vote.Chairing a session on May 21 of the working group of senior law enforcement officials and parliament members tasked with ensuring the Armenian authorities implement the demands listed in a Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) resolution adopted in April, Sarkisian insisted that none of the Ter-Petrossian supporters taken into custody during and after the March 1 violence should be jailed simply on the basis of their political convictions, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. ""It is important that we be guided by criminal law and that there be no political decisions,"" Sarkisian said, adding that ""no one who committed a serious crime must remain unpunished.""The PACE resolution called for the ""urgent release of the persons detained on seemingly artificial and politically motivated charges"" in the wake of the Yerevan violence, but only a few of the up to 100 detainees have been released to date. Council of Europe Deputy Secretary-General Maud de Boer-Buquicchio told RFE/RL on May 20 after talks in Yerevan with top Armenian officials that she is ""still waiting"" for the ""good news"" that the others have been freed. On May 19, one Yerevan court prolonged by a further two months the pretrial detention of Nor Zhamanakner (New Times) party leader Aram Karapetian, who was hospitalized last week with serious heart problems, while a second court began the trial of Vartan Djahangirian, who was shot and seriously wounded at the time of his arrest on February 23. Djahangirian's brother Gagik, a former deputy prosecutor-general, publicly pledged his support for Ter-Petrossian and endorsed the latter's claims that the February 19 election was rigged to prevent a Ter-Petrossian victory. Meanwhile, a third attempt by opposition Zharangutiun party leader Raffi Hovannisian (no relation to Vahan) to bring the two camps together for dialogue fell flat, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on May 20. Hovannisian sent written invitations the previous day to President Sarkisian, Ter-Petrossian, and the leaders of the three junior partners in the ruling coalition to participate in a roundtable discussion of a reform program drafted by Zharangutiun, but none of the invitees showed up. The four-page program details measures to preclude fraud in future elections and advocates a sweeping reform of the judicial and law enforcement systems. Hovannisian offered twice before to bring Sarkisian and Ter-Petrossian together for talks.",,,0
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1117492.html,Analysis Armenian Opposition Issues New Ultimatum ,"May 15, 2008 15:26 GMT",,,"The standoff between the Armenian authorities and opposition that resulted from the flawed February 19 presidential ballot and the violent police crackdown 11 days later on opposition supporters who rejected the official election returns looks set to continue. Speaking on May 12 on Armenian Public Television, Levon Zurabian, who is an aide to former President and defeated presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian, said that unless the Armenian authorities revoke by June 20 the restrictions on public meetings and demonstrations enacted by parliament in March, the opposition Pan-National Movement that supports Ter-Petrossian will defy that ban and convene a meeting on Yerevan's Freedom Square. Former Justice Minister David Harutiunian, who now chairs the parliament commission on legal affairs, pledged on April 22 that the legislature will ease the restrictions by the end of May, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Freedom Square was the site of the mass protests that followed the announcement that according to official returns, the February 19 presidential ballot was won by then-Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian with almost 53 percent of the vote. Ter-Petrossian, who polled only 21.5 percent, claimed he had been denied an outright victory. The Freedom Square protests lasted until early on March 1, when they were broken up by police. A subsequent assault on opposition supporters later that day resulted in 10 deaths, including one police officer. Outgoing President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency that was lifted three weeks later, but the restrictions on public rallies enacted by the parliament on March 17 remain in force. Ter-Petrossian's supporters initially sought to circumvent those restrictions by staging ""protest walks,"" but police intervened. Then, on April 19, the Yerevan municipal authorities gave permission for a pro-Ter-Petrossian rally in Yerevan that was attended by several thousand people. But permission for a second such rally, to be held on May 5, was withheld. On May 2, Ter-Petrossian convened a congress of his Armenian Pan-National Movement (HHSh) in a government conference hall in Yerevan. In his 90-minute address to that gathering -- his first public address since March 1 -- Ter-Petrossian said, as he had done earlier, that while he does not consider Sarkisian the legitimately-elected president, he is ready to accept his invitation to dialogue provided that the authorities first comply with the demands contained in a resolution adopted on April 17 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). They include conducting an ""independent, transparent and credible inquiry"" into the March 1 violence; the release of persons detained in the wake of those clashes ""on seemingly artificial and politically motivated charges;"" and the immediate repeal of the legal amendments effectively banning opposition rallies. Ter-Petrossian's staff estimate the total number of those detained or arrested at over 100; according to the Prosecutor-General's Office, 59 people have been formally charged. Those still in detention include several of Ter-Petrossian's closest associates within the HHSh, among them former Foreign Minister Alexander Arzoumanian. Ter-Petrossian further told the May 2 congress that he thinks the only way to defuse the persisting tensions is to hold preterm parliamentary and presidential elections; at the same time, he admitted that neither the Armenian leadership nor the international community is likely to welcome that proposal, Noyan Tapan reported. And he argued forcefully that the HHSh should be restructured and strengthened, given that ""it is obvious that thanks to its broad public support, the...movement will play a permanent and decisive role in all future political processes in Armenia,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Ter-Petrossian further proposed that the two dozen mostly small opposition parties and groups that backed his presidential bid should form an alliance, to be called the Armenian National Congress, that might eventually coalesce into a single political party. But at least one of his backers was cool to such a merger: People's Party of Armenia leader Stepan Demirchian, who ran unsuccessfully against incumbent President Kocharian in the February-March 2003 presidential ballot, told journalists on May 9 that while the consolidation of opposition forces is welcome, it is ""too early"" to talk about merging parties, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Meanwhile, the Armenian authorities have agreed to the PACE demand for an independent investigation into the March 1-2 violence, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on May 12, quoting Avet Adonts, a members of Armenia's PACE delegation. Adonts said the commission will be formed by the end of this month and include representatives of both parliamentary and extraparliamentary parties and ""international forensic experts."" And in a further small gesture of goodwill, two close Ter-Petrossian associates arrested in the wake of the March clashes, former deputy parliament speaker Karapet Rubinian and Union of Painters of Armenia member Tigran Baghdasarian, were released from detention on May 13, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1109650.html,A Month In The Media ,"April 29, 2008 14:20 GMT",,,"Rumors of Putin's affair with Alina Kabayeva got ""Moskovsky korrespondent"" into hot water (AFP) The battle for media freedoms is waged daily, where&nbsp;governments resort to a variety of methods to undermine the independent press. But while reports of beatings or even the murders of journalists often reach the outside world, other less-sensational tactics are commonly employed at the state and local levels. The following examples, culled from the month of April, 2008, shed some light on some of these tactics -- from pressure from tax authorities, to intimidation of family members, to character assassination. Russia A week after publishing an article claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin had divorced his wife and was planning to marry a young, former Olympic gymnast, the tabloid ""Moskovsky korrespondent"" was closed down by its owner. ""Large costs"" and ""differences with the editorial staff over its concept"" are the stated reasons for the closure, but Putin's irritation with the April 11 article was clear in the days that followed the scandal. In an effort seen as a means of curbing the yellow press, the Russian State Duma is currently considering legislation that would expand the number of reasons for which a publication may be shut down for defamation. Chechnya Jane Armstrong, a correspondent for Canada's ""The Globe And Mail,"" was detained by Russia's Federal Security Service at her hotel in Grozny early on April 17, interrogated for several hours, fined 300,000 rubles ($12,710), and ordered to leave Chechnya immediately. Armstrong had authorization to travel to Chechnya from the Russian Foreign Ministry, had met earlier in Grozny with Chechen Culture Minister Dikalu Muzakayev and traveled to the southern Shatoi Raion to gather material for an article on Chechen customs, folklore, and history. Belarus Valery Shchukin, a journalist and human rights advocate, was accompanying the latest print run of the independent Belarusian newspaper ""Vitsebsky kuryer"" on April 24, when he encountered harassment. Upon his return from Russia -- where the newspaper was printed due to a local, state-owned printer's refusal to do so -- Shchukin was stopped by police, who confiscated the print run. Shchukin suffered chest pains in the course of the incident and was hospitalized for high blood pressure. Financial problems had prevented the publication of the newspaper in recent months, putting the paper at risk of losing its license if it did not publish within a year and forcing it to turn to the Russian printing house. Moldova Pending a court hearing stemming from a lawsuit filed by a former regional prosecutor, Moldova's influential opposition newspaper ""Jurnal de Chisinau"" found its bank accounts frozen. Former Donduseni district prosecutor Ion Neagu has accused the 30,000-circulation paper of damaging his reputation with the publication of two reports in 2003. Newspaper lawyer Vitalie Nagacevschi has characterized the lawsuit as ""proof of the death throes of the communist regime, and is aimed at abolishing the opposition press."" Azerbaijan Azerbaijani opposition journalist Aqil Xalil in early April filed a defamation lawsuit against four pro-government television stations that reported that attacks against Xalil had been carried by his ""homosexual partner."" The attacks on Xalil involved a stabbing by unknown assailants in March and an assault in late February. Xalil has claimed he was subjected to physical and psychological pressure by the authorities while undergoing questioning in relation to the attacks, and he has consistently accused security officers of complicity. Armenia The independent television station GALA encountered numerous obstacles after angering the Armenian authorities by airing comments made by a key opposition figure. The Gyumri-based station fell afoul of both the local and central governments in late 2007 after providing airtime to Levon Ter-Petrossian, who eventually finished second in the country's February 19 presidential election. The station was subsequently raided and fined for tax evasion and other alleged violations, and in a separate move was accused by Gyumri's mayoral office of illegally using the city's television tower. The station was able to raise some 27 million drams ($88,000) for paying off fines imposed for tax evasion, but its broadcasts were suspended temporarily after being ordered to vacate and remove its equipment from the city's old television tower. Bosnia-Herzegovina Following its criticism of the government of Republika Srpska, the magazine ""Patriot"" was recently forced to close its doors. Editor in Chief Slobodan Vaskovic says the authorities employed a number of pressure tactics that contributed to the magazine's demise, including attacks and threats made against him and his family members, monitoring his telephone calls, and discouraging companies from advertising with ""Patriot."" Vaskovic heads to court in May to argue his case in a defamation lawsuit filed by Republika Srpska's prime minister and says that, ""if nothing changes, the only solution for my family and me will be to leave the country.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1109631.html,Armenia Yerevan Moscow Set Up Uranium Venture ,"April 25, 2008 13:14 GMT",Armenia and Russia look to research uranium deposits,,"By Shakeh Avoyan The Armenian and Russian governments set up on April 22 a joint venture that will explore and possibly develop untapped uranium reserves in Armenia's southeastern Syunik region. ""The new joint venture will explore and ascertain our uranium reserves,"" Armenian Environment Minister Aram Harutiunian said after signing a relevant agreement in Yerevan with Russia's state-owned Atomredmetzoloto company, which mines and processes uranium. In accordance that agreement, the Russian firm will have a 50 percent stake in the venture and invest about $3 million in exploratory work to be conducted in Syunik during the first year of operations. The mountainous region bordering Iran was explored by Soviet geologists in the 1950s-70s and is estimated to contain 30,000 metric tons of uranium ore. Harutiunian said earlier this month that the Russian government will turn over to Yerevan classified Soviet-era data on the precise location and size of potential uranium deposits in the area. An agreement on a more extensive Russian-Armenian exploration of those deposits was reached during an April 2007 visit to Yerevan by Sergei Kiriyenko, head of Russia's Federal Agency on Atomic Energy (Rosatom). He was confident that Armenian and Russian specialists will discover commercially viable amounts of the radioactive metal used in nuclear power generation. Kiriyenko said Armenia could become one of the few countries of the world with a full uranium production cycle from extraction of the metal to its transformation into nuclear fuel. Some of that fuel would be supplied to the nuclear power station at Metsamor, he added at the time. The Soviet-era plant generates approximately 40 percent of Armenia's electricity. The Armenian government intends to replace Metsamor's sole functioning reactor with a more modern and twice as powerful facility before its anticipated deactivation in 2016. Russian energy companies have expressed strong interest in the construction of a new nuclear plant and, according to Kiriyenko, are well placed to win an international tender for the project to be called by the Yerevan government. Both Harutiunian and Atomredmetzoloto's executive director, Vadim Zhivov, stressed that the Russian-Armenian joint venture will concentrate on ascertaining just how rich Armenia is rich in uranium and has no plans for mining operations for the time being. Zhivov said Russian investments will rise to ""tens of millions of dollars"" if the exploratory work lives up to Atomredmetzoloto's expectations. A U.S. company, Global Gold, has been prospecting for uranium in another Armenian region for the past two years.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1109586.html,Armenia New Government Takes Shape Faces Big Challenges ,"April 17, 2008 13:42 GMT",,,"Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian (file photo) (ITAR-TASS) Armenia's new government is beginning to take shape, with the naming of six ministers this week. Only three will be new faces, however. Armenia's former ambassador to France, Eduard Nalbandian, has assumed the position of foreign minister. Seyran Ohanian, the former chief of Armenia's armed forces, has become the defense minister. The third new face has been known for more than a week, with the appointment of former Central Bank chief Tigran Sarkisian to the post of prime minister. Three ministers retained the positions they held in the outgoing government. Gevorg Danielian (Republican Party) will stay on as justice minister, while Armen Grigorian (Prosperous Armenia) will continue as minister of sport and youth affairs and David Lokian (Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun) as agriculture minister. Consultations Continuing The ruling coalition -- led by President Serzh Sarkisian's Republican Party and including Prosperous Armenia, Orinats Yerkir, and Dashnaktsutiun -- is continuing consultations, and a full cabinet is expected to be formed by the end of this week. The new government will have its work cut out for it in winning over a population still recovering from the bloodiest postelection violence Armenia has ever seen. After weeks of protests contesting the results of the country's February 19 presidential election, police on March 1 moved in with force to drive opposition supporters from the capital's Freedom Square. Dominated by backers of second-place finisher Levon Ter-Petrossian, the rallies were staged daily to voice the belief that the election was rigged and to call for a new vote. Ten people -- including protesters and two police officers -- were killed as a result of the chaos that followed the police action. Armenian authorities followed up by imposing a 20-day state of emergency, making mass arrests, introducing a ban on public demonstrations, and curtailing media freedoms. As a result of those steps, the new government also faces an uphill climb in restoring its image in the international community. The Monitoring Commission of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution on April 17 urging the Armenian authorities to implement a number of reforms aimed at improving the situation in the country. PACE suggests launching an independent inquiry into the clashes, releasing all prisoners who did not commit crimes, amending the law on public rallies, and engaging in a dialogue with the opposition. PACE warns that, unless those conditions are met, it will consider suspending the voting rights of Armenia during its next session, which takes place in June. 'Attempts To Increase Legitimacy' Alexander Iskandarian, the director of the Yerevan-based Caucasus Media Institute, says the Armenian authorities are well aware of the need to improve their image. ""Everything that the authorities are doing now represents their attempt to increase legitimacy,"" Iskandarian says. ""Be it through appointments of some neutral figures; through attempts to talk to the public and assure them that steps will be made to improve the situation; through appropriation of the opposition's slogans; through the removal of figures from the government who particularly irritate people; and so on. These are attempts to increase legitimacy -- attempts to make people trust the government and president more. The authorities are lacking this right now. Whether they will be successful in their attempts remains to be seen."" Most observers do not expect significant changes in the country's foreign or domestic policies. New Foreign Minister Nalbandian, is a 52-year-old career diplomat who, apart from France, has also served as the country's ambassador to Israel, Andorra, and the Vatican. He replaces Vartan Oskanian, a veteran diplomat who announced his resignation last week. ""At this moment, it is difficult to predict what the next president will do,"" Oskanian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service after his resignation. ""It's his choice, what kind of foreign policy he will implement -- whether he will maintain the notion of 'complementarity' [between Russia and the West] or not. But given my experience, I don't think Armenia's room to maneuver is very wide. Our options are limited. What can be done is simply to make some changes in accents, not necessarily in direction."" New Defense Minister Ohanian, who is 46, is a close associate of the new president, Serzh Sarkisian. Both men hail from Nagorno-Karabakh and have a longstanding friendship. ""Seyran Ohanian has a somewhat standard background for Armenian high-ranking officials,"" says Iskandarian. ""Just like nearly the entire political and, moreover, military elite of Armenia, his 'roots' are in the Karabakh war. He is a veteran of the war and has firsthand military experience. After that, he worked at various posts at the Defense Ministry."" The new administration's attitude on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh -- an Armenian-controlled and -populated enclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war in 1988-94 -- has perhaps gained the most clarity. In his first major foreign-policy speech on April 16, Armenia's president was uncompromising. ""Azerbaijan must understand the simple reality that the existence of the republic of Nagorno-Karabakh's independence is irreversible,"" Sarkisian said. ""The people of Nagorno-Karabakh have won their right to a free and independent life. And through our efforts, that right must be recognized by the international community.""",,,

""Taking the post of president,"" he said, ""I swear to act in accordance with the constitution; to respect the human rights and freedoms of citizens; to guarantee the independence, territorial integrity and security of the republic -- in glory of the Republic of Armenia and for the prosperity of the people of the Republic of Armenia."" The former prime minister made the pledges before a special parliamentary session held near the scene of large-scale protests that followed his February election victory. His inauguration took place inside the Yerevan Opera House, which stands adjacent to the square where the monthlong protests came to a violent conclusion 40 days ago. In the course of the ceremony, the new president also addressed the controversy surrounding his election, promising to reconcile with his opponents. ""This ceremony takes place about a month after painful events, which inflicted wounds that are still fresh,"" he said. ""Today, I urge everybody to look forward, together, to seek and find the way for reconciliation, development, and future of Armenia."" Eight People Killed On March 1, police moved in to break up rallies staged on Freedom Square by opposition supporters who believed Sarkisian's victory was rigged. Eight people, including one police officer, died in the violent clashes that ensued, leading the authorities to impose a 20-day state of emergency. As the April 9 inauguration ceremonies were taking place, hundreds of supporters of the man who finished second to Sarkisian in the February 19 poll, Levon Ter-Petrossian, gathered in the capital to lay flowers in memory of those killed. Police forces watched from afar, but some arguments between protesters and police forces were reported. Aram Abramian, political analyst and the editor in chief of the Armenian newspaper ""Aravot,"" says the opposition harbors significant animosity over the violence. ""There is an active group, among the youth especially, who attended Ter-Petrossian's rallies for 10 days in a row after the elections -- well, they are still significantly electrified,"" Abramian says. ""But I would not say that the whole society lives only with this memory. The society is preoccupied with its everyday concerns."" Sarkisian's ascent to the presidency led to widespread speculation that his predecessor, Robert Kocharian, might take over Sarkisian's post as prime minister. The two men are leaders of the so-called Karabakh clan, which critics claim is given preferential treatment within government circles. Both Sarkisian and Kocharian are from Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-controlled and -populated exclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war from 1988-94. But Sarkisian's position as prime minister is now expected to be filled by Armenia's Central Bank chief, 48-year-old Tigran Sarkisian, who is of no relation to the new president. Not Another 'Karabakhian' On April 8, Tigran Sarkisian's candidacy for the vacant post was backed by the country's ruling coalition, led by the new president's Republican Party. According to Abramian, the appointment of Tigran Sarkisian -- who is not from Nagorno-Karabakh -- could serve to distance the new president from allegations that he will pad his administration with officials from the region. ""I think this factor -- that [Tigran Sarkisian] is not from Karabakh -- did influence Serzh Sarkisian's choice,"" Abramian says. ""However, in reality, this is not the most important aspect. What's important is the policies that he will implement. But the fact that on a day-to-day level people will not say, 'Look, another Karabakhian was appointed' -- perhaps this really matters."" Serzh Sarkisian's fledgling presidency faces a stern test in repairing the Armenian government's image both at home and abroad. Delegations from 58 countries and 12 international organizations reportedly took part in the ceremonies, but criticism over the violence that marred the postelection rallies continues to linger. Western governments have stopped short of targeting Kocharian and Sarkisian specifically, saying that both the ruling authorities and Ter-Petrossian had a hand in the violence. But watchdog organizations have been less forgiving of the government's actions. In the run-up to Sarkisian's inauguration, the New York-based Human Rights Watch and the Brussels-based International Crisis Group released reports reiterating their condemnation of the violence, as well as recently passed restrictions on public demonstrations. 'Dramatic Steps' Needed U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza said in an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service on April 9 that ""dramatic steps"" are needed to restore a sense of confidence that the country is moving in the right direction. ""What happened on March 1 is unprecedented in the latest and, of course, permanent phase of an independent Armenia -- or in the South Caucasus,"" he said. ""After an election, despite all of the turbulence in Georgia and Azerbaijan and Armenia over the course of the last 18 years, or 17 years, something like this has never happened, with people being killed -- at least eight people killed."" Bryza said liberties such as freedom of the media and assembly should be restored, ""with the understanding that all such freedoms are a two-way street."" He also called on the authorities to release opposition figures who were arrested before and during the state of emergency that was declared after the violence. The European Union has kept a low profile on Armenia since the bloc's Slovenian presidency issued a statement on March 12 demanding an independent inquiry into the violence and asking all political parties to engage in dialogue. However, one EU diplomat told RFE/RL on condition of anonymity that the fact that EU foreign-policy chief Javier Solana put off sending a congratulatory letter to Sarkisian until this week was intended to convey the bloc's disapproval of the government's resort to violence.",,,

Scattered skirmishes broke out when hundreds of people gathered in downtown Yerevan to mark the end of emergency rule. RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported that a heavy police presence greeted people who turned out to honor eight people killed when security forces dispersed opposition-led protests three weeks ago. RFE/RL's Yerevan bureau said opposition figure Arakel Semerjian -- a relative of opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrossian, who claims his presidential bid was thwarted by official fraud in the February 19 election -- was detained by police in one of the confrontations. Ter-Petrossian remains under de facto house arrest, his movements restricted by security forces around his home. A senior U.S. official, speaking ahead of the lifting of the state of emergency, highlighted international concern over the risk of a collapse in that country's political dialogue, warning that Armenia still has work to do to ""get back on the democratic path."" Outgoing President Robert Kocharian declared emergency rule on March 1, when fatal clashes left at least seven civilians and one policeman dead in the worst civil violence in Armenia's post-Soviet history. Kocharian announced at a news conference hours before the clampdown was lifted overnight that there was ""no reason to extend the state of emergency"" and that ""normal life"" would return to the capital on March 21. A new law that was passed this week, however, gives authorities the right to ban demonstrations if they pose a threat to public order. Kocharian defended his decision to declare emergency rule and looked ahead to the upcoming transfer of power to President-elect Serzh Sarkisian. ""My task now is the stabilization of the entire situation. It should be brought back, in terms of manageability, to the condition that we had before the elections,"" Kocharian said. ""The question here, of course, is not about the psychological factor, which will require more time. [There is a] need to transfer power to the newly elected president under manageable conditions. And this is how it will be."" Security forces on March 21 guard a downtown site where demonstrators and police clashed three weeks earlierOfficial results showed Sarkisian, the current prime minister, defeating opposition candidate Levon Ter-Petrossian by a wide margin in the February 19 poll that critics say was marked by widespread falsification. The opposition has claimed the civilian death toll when security forces dispersed protesters on March 1 was much higher and that police initiated the violence. International Concern Watchdog groups such as Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have condemned the violence and called on authorities to investigate the use of force. Some international observers have warned that the fissure between the Armenian government and the opposition appears deeper and the danger of further violence much higher than in neighboring Georgia -- where street protests and a state of emergency preceded President Mikheil Saakashvili's reelection in the face of fractured opposition in January. In an interview with RFE/RL on March 20, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried urged Armenia to ""pull itself together and get back on a democratic path."" ""We welcome the lifting of the state of emergency, but there are other problems and these need to be addressed,"" Fried said. ""People who have been arrested for rioting and violent actions, that's one thing. But people who have been arrested for more questionable reasons need to be let go -- there needs to be normalization; there needs to be a dialogue with the opposition. Look, this is a troubling situation for all of Armenia's friends."" Coup Allegations Armenian prosecutors announced on March 19 that they had arrested 106 people for allegedly plotting to stage a coup during the postelection protests. Some 800 more have been brought in for questioning. Opposition leaders dismiss the coup allegations and say that many of those arrested were supporters of Ter-Petrossian whose arrests were politically motivated. Detainees include members of parliament and a former foreign minister. The state of emergency banned public gatherings and imposed press restrictions.",,,

Thirty nine countries voted in favor. But more than 100 countries abstained. Seven countries, however, including Russia, the United States, and France, voted against. The three countries are co-chairs of the Minsk Group, which is trying to facilitate a negotiated settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. They argued that, as mediators, they had to remain neutral. In a statement released on March 15, the Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the resolution, saying that its ""basic principles...meet only the interests of Azerbaijan."" Speaking to reporters in Baku, Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov said Moscow, Paris, and Washington ""have put themselves in a difficult situation."" Azimov added that ""the UN resolution is a serious message to Armenia and a warning for the co-chairs. We will cooperate with them on the basis of their position in the UN General Assembly."" Meanwhile, on March 13, Armenia's Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said President-elect Serzh Sarkisian was prepared to meet with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to discuss the Karabakh conflict. Oskanian said France, Russia, and the United States were trying to arrange the meeting, which could happen at the NATO summit in Bucharest in April. Yerevan and Baku have given conflicting reports about a clash that erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh in early March. Armenia said eight people were killed, while Azerbaijan said the number was 20. Armenian forces seized control of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding regions from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s, in a war that claimed an estimated 30,000 lives and forced about a million people to flee their homes. Nagorno-Karabakh has been under control of ethnic-Armenian forces since a 1994 cease-fire.",,,

Instead, many say they are witnessing the return of Soviet-era censorship after a central publishing house in the capital, Yerevan, blocked the printing of any newspapers featuring content seen as critical of the government or favoring the opposition. Aram Abramian, the editor in chief of the ""Aravot"" independent daily, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that the Tigran Mets publishing house refused to print the March 14 edition of the newspaper after hastily commissioned censors objected to coverage of a press conference held by opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrossian. ""A KGB censor was sitting in the room. They said they were from the National Security Service,"" said Abramian, referring to Armenia's KGB successor agency. ""My deputy was there; I didn't go. They closed the door and started calling one of their higher-ups. Then the officer told my deputy that [the article on] Levon Ter-Petrossian's press conference contains obviously false news and that the paper couldn't be printed."" Free To Print, With Conditions Under the 20-day state of emergency imposed on March 1, Armenian media could only cite the government and law-enforcement bodies when covering national politics. More than a dozen independent and opposition newspapers and online news services were forced to suspend their operations as a result. Kocharian appeared to reverse course on March 13, saying journalists could resume their work. But he added a caveat: ""obviously false or destabilizing information"" about domestic political affairs was forbidden, as were calls for Armenians to participate in unsanctioned demonstrations. In so doing, the outgoing Armenian leader evidently hoped to prevent a continuation of the mass public protests that followed the controversial election, in which the president's ally, Serzh Sarkisian, won a contested victory over Ter-Petrossian. The demonstrations ended in violence on March 1, when eight people were reported killed in clashes between protesters and police. Journalists on March 13 were critical of Kocharian's new conditions, saying they may serve as a smokescreen for government censorship. Mesrop Harutiunian of the Yerevan Press Club, an independent media watchdog, said the terms could be used ""for muzzling the independent and opposition press,"" and suggested that any report containing views differing from the official line could be construed by authorities as ""obviously false."" 'Dictatorship' Condemned Haik Gevorgian, the deputy editor of the popular opposition newspaper ""Haikakan Zhamanak,"" was among those to have his publication rejected by the Tigran Mets censors. ""The National Security Service officer was sitting there,"" Gevorgian told RFE/RL. ""He was happy to see us. He smiled. We made some jokes. He looked at the paper and then he reported by phone to wherever it was necessary to report. And as a result, the paper wasn't published in the morning."" Employees from at least 13 leading independent and pro-opposition newspapers and Internet news sites today signed a petition condemning the new media restrictions. An accompanying statement accused the Armenian authorities of seeking to ""prolong dictatorship."" Most Armenian Internet sites remain blocked despite Kocharian's new measures.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079627.html,Armenia Key US Diplomat Calls For Roundtable In Wake Of Clashes ,"March 12, 2008 16:13 GMT",,,"Opposition protesters in Yerevan on March 1 (Photolur) Armenians have been living under strict restrictions since March 1, when police cracked down on opposition supporters who were protesting against alleged fraud in the February 19 presidential election. The U.S. administration's chief diplomat for the Caucasus, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza, is calling for a roundtable meeting of Armenia's political leaders to resolve the crisis. Bryza spoke of his efforts with RFE/RL correspondent Andrew F. Tully. RFE/RL: Despite your calls on the Armenian government to stop arresting opposition activists, they're still being arrested. What can be done about it? Matthew Bryza: It's ultimately a problem that has to be repaired by the government of Armenia, of course, and we call on the government of Armenia to cease arrests of political leaders and to restore the democratic momentum that was what had characterized Armenia's political development until the period just after this last election. So it's really up to the government of Armenia to take steps to restore this democratic momentum. So, one way besides ceasing these arrests is to restore media freedom and then to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible, and then finally launch a nationwide roundtable -- and by nationwide I mean including all major political parties -- to chart the course forward to strengthen Armenia's democracy. RFE/RL: As many independent journalists have reported, opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrossian is technically under house arrest. There are indications that the government might arrest him formally. For example, today Armenian Minister of Justice Gevorg Danielian told the French news agency AFP that there is enough evidence to press criminal charges against him. Meanwhile, Armenia's general prosecutor said in his statement on March 7 that Ter-Petrossian ""hypnotized the people and used psychological sabotage, all kinds of psychological tricks, mechanisms of deception."" What is your reaction? Bryza: Wow, that's quite a statement. My reaction is that [regarding] Mr. Ter-Petrossian -- it's disputed whether he's under house arrest, if you talk to the government of Armenia. If you talk to him, he probably says he's under house arrest. I went to visit him at his house and found it a useful conversation in which I encouraged him to participate fully in dialogue with the government of Armenia to do what I mentioned before: to chart a way forward to restore democratic momentum in Armenian society. There is much criticism. People have been sending [criticism] in both directions -- both toward the opposition and Mr. Ter-Petrossian and the government -- in terms of what happened on March 1 with the violent demonstrations. Mr. Ter-Petrossian is obviously a very well-known politician who is very skillful in his oration, so he does have the ability to inspire people, and he was doing so through his repeated appearances at the demonstrations in Theater Square in Yerevan. So that's what he was doing: He was being a politician. And in the aftermath of what happened on March 1, as I said, there were a lot of allegations that both the government and the opposition sides were using violence. Now, no one accuses Mr. Ter-Petrossian himself of using violence, but there were people in the crowd who did use violence, and in many cases perhaps they would say ""provoked."" But in any case this wasn't an instance of a particular leader having magical powers. Mr. Ter-Petrossian was being a politician. RFE/RL: Armenian authorities say security forces used no firearms when they dispersed the demonstration on March 1. The opposition says Special Forces fired indiscriminately on demonstrators and that there are more casualties than the government has reported. There was a suggestion by the EU presidency to conduct an independent investigation. Do you support the idea? Bryza: We support the idea of an independent investigation, and it's useful. But, that said, I think it'll be very difficult ever to assess exactly how the tragically violent events transpired. Now what we need to do is move forward; to repair the damage of the election by prosecuting people who used violence unlawfully or who were violating election law. So that is looking back a little bit, but we need to get beyond the backward-looking and move forward.... We urge Mr. Ter-Petrossian to participate constructively in a dialogue with all the political leaders, including the government of Armenia, and find a way to repair the damage done by the election, and also chart a way to strengthen Armenia's democratic institutions. RFE/RL: There are only a few countries that block citizens' access to the Internet, and now Armenia is one of them. The media in Armenia is in fact not operational today. No opposition or independent newspapers can be published, only progovernment media. RFE/RL has also been prevented from broadcasting. Despite your requests, the Armenian government has shown no intention of lifting the media restrictions. In your interview with the Associated Press, you said, ""It seems clear that the reaction by the government was harsh and brutal."" Do you think it is time for President George W. Bush to get involved in solving Armenia's crisis? Bryza: I think we have a very useful and effective means of communication with the leadership of Armenia and the opposition. I also think it's essential, as does my government...that these media freedoms be restored. And I also have a feeling that in the government of Armenia, people are thinking through how to do that, and so we can only urge them to restore those media freedoms as quickly as possible. Brutality occurred on both sides, and I also tried to make that clear; in fact I've tried to make that clear in all of my interviews. The problem is that once people get into a confrontational situation in the street, and if there is not a free flow of information through an independent media, each side tends to demonize the other. And it's much more difficult to bring back under control the emotions that are stoked when government and opposition people are confronting each other in the street. So the brutality refers to what happened overall. Ultimately, of course, governments have responsibility for the use of government force against civilians. Civilians have a responsibility as well to protest peacefully and to use mechanisms within the rule of law to express themselves. So that's what we call on everybody to do, and again we underscore that to keep tension at the lowest possible level, it's important that there be free media so that all sorts of unfounded rumors don't percolate through society and raise tensions even higher. RFE/RL: And what about President Bush's possible involvement? Bryza: As I said, we have very effective channels of communication right now, we're communicating at many levels, so I'm comfortable that the way we're communicating now with the government is satisfactory. President Bush will make his own decision, and if he wishes to become involved, that's of course his decision. He's the head of our government, he is the ultimate determiner of our foreign policy, and it's up to him to decide when to get involved in any issue. RFE/RL: As you mentioned earlier, the United States is urging Armenians to start a dialogue, and a roundtable was suggested as a possible format of talks between the government and the opposition. Could you be more specific? Bryza: We would like to see representatives of all the largest political parties -- opposition, progovernment, coalition members -- we'd very much like to see them all coming together for a discussion representing all the voters of Armenia for talks about the future of Armenia's democratic institutions, and talks about how to strengthen those institutions. What the specific topics would be is up to the participants, of course, but the process of them resolving their country's political future through discussions at the bargaining table rather than in the streets is the way to build a healthy democracy. RFE/RL: What is Russia's role in this political crisis? Are you also talking with Moscow about the events in Armenia? Will Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raise the issue in her meetings with Russian officials when she visits Moscow later this month? Bryza: We talk to our colleagues in the Russian government and Russian diplomatic circles about many issues that have to do with the Caucasus. We remain in constant contact about developments in Armenia as well as in Azerbaijan, so of course we're in general contact. We're not coordinating, however, our overall diplomatic responses in terms of what step we think needs to be taken next. The United States has a clear vision of what developing a genuine democracy means, and we're pursuing that objective on our own, but in close collaboration with the private citizens and the government of Armenia.",,,

""I talked with approximately 20 or 30 people who had been beaten, who simply didn't have any way to escape,"" said Stepanyan, an eight-year veteran of RFE/RL. ""Many people had head and face wounds."" By midday, the crowd had swelled to thousands of people, and had moved to a nearby street in front of the French Embassy -- where, Stepanyan said, protesters thought the police would be more reluctant to use force against the public. But clashes once again broke out. ""It was impossible to disperse the rally, because people were very, very angry about the violence earlier in the day,"" Stepanyan said. ""The police and the demonstrators started to fight each other; the demonstrators fought with whatever they had -- stones, pieces of metal. I was caught in the middle, between the two sides; there was no way for me to get out. I felt that it was the end, that there was no way for me to escape."" Many of the policemen were oblivious to the journalists who were caught in the middle of the clashes, but one eventually helped Stepanyan to move out of danger. Her driver was badly beaten. That evening, Armenian President Robert Kocharian imposed a state of emergency. But it wasn't sufficient to prevent a final clash from escalating into gunfire, reportedly resulting in the deaths of seven civilians and a policeman. ""I've never seen such a situation in Armenia, where people hate each other so much that they are reduced to beating each other in a completely inhuman fashion,"" Stepanyan said. ""They're all Armenians; they're all citizens. They simply didn't realize what they were doing, because it was such a tense situation. There were people who had been really badly injured, and they wanted revenge."" A second correspondent, Karine Simonian, has been reporting on the crisis from the city of Vanadzor in northern Armenia. She says the state of emergency, which imposes strict limitations on non-state media, has made reporting extremely difficult. ""I can't record interviews; access to information is extremely hard to get,"" she said. ""I've tried just speaking to people informally, but they've refused to speak to me, saying they're afraid of being persecuted by the authorities."" Simonian said local police have also broken up several interviews. ""People are simply afraid to say anything,"" she added.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079586.html,Armenia Crisis Spotlights Karabakh Clan ,"March 05, 2008 14:01 GMT",,,"Serzh Sarkisian: ""Yes I am Karabakhian, but I am Armenian first"" (AFP) As Armenia's first post-Soviet president in the 1990s, Levon Ter-Petrossian brought in top officials from Nagorno-Karabakh to serve in his government. Today, as an opposition leader, Ter-Petrossian is the most outspoken critic of what he and his allies call the ""Karabakh clan,"" lambasting his former proteges for raiding the country's treasury, strangling the economy, and stifling democracy. The main targets of the broadside have been outgoing President Robert Kocharian and his preferred successor, Serzh Sarkisian, the current prime minister who defeated Ter-Petrossian in Armenia's February 19 presidential election. Both Kocharian and Sarkisian hail from Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled and populated enclave within Azerbaijan over which Baku and Yerevan fought a war in 1988-94. Speaking on the campaign trail in February, Ter-Petrossian accused Kocharian and Sarkisian of bringing their Karabakh allies to Armenia and handing them the crown jewels of the economy. ""Because of these two persons, 15,000 people have moved from Karabakh to Armenia, mainly Yerevan, in the past 10 years,"" Ter-Petrossian said. ""Each of them has been given a position. As if that wasn't enough, now the business sphere is also being given to them."" Sarkisian's pat response to the criticism has been to say: ""Yes I am Karabakhian, but I am Armenian first."" Armenia's controversial election has led to allegations of fraud, government resignations, violent street protests, a deadly police crackdown, and a state of emergency. It has also exposed a deep rift in society between those born in Armenia proper and those from Nagorno-Karabakh who have resettled in the country. Critics allege that Karabakh Armenians have benefited from government favoritism and that Kocharian and Sarkisian have dragged their feet on formally ending the conflict to advance their cronies' business interests. Yerevan-based political analyst Stepan Grigorian, who is sympathetic to Ter-Petrossian and the opposition, says having a president from Nagorno-Karabakh ""who governs Armenia very badly"" has fueled resentment. ""Certain negative feelings exist,"" Grigorian says. ""They do not extend to ordinary people of Karabakh, but refer to those people who came to Armenia from there. Robert Kocharian brought many people with him, and appointed them to high positions. This created more caution. So yes, certain tension exists, of course."" The Karabakh Oligarchs Armenia had control of Karabakh when a cease-fire was reached in 1994. But the victory came with a price, as Armenia's borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have remained sealed. Ter-Petrossian, who became Armenia's first post-independence president in 1991, brought Sarkisian -- who was a senior military official in Nagorno-Karabakh -- to Yerevan in 1993 to serve as defense minister. In 1998, he named Kocharian, who served as chairman of Nagorno-Karabakh's State Defense Committee and later as president, Armenia's prime minister. It was a decision Ter-Petrossian soon regretted. He proposed a compromise solution to Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh that Kocharian staunchly opposed. Ter-Petrossian was forced to resign over the issue in February 1998 and Kocharian won a special election to succeed him. Under Kocharian, Sarkisian served in a number of posts including defense minister, interior minister, national-security minister, presidential chief of staff, and most recently, prime minister. Aram Abramian, editor in chief of the Yerevan-based daily newspaper ""Aravot"" and who has roots in Nagorno-Karabakh, says Kocharian and Sarkisian brought in associates from the territory who took over state posts and dominated the business elite. ""There are 20, 30 families -- oligarchs -- people who, thanks to the opportunities that are provided to them by the authorities, became rich, and have wide possibilities of avoiding taxes and custom fees,"" Abramian says, adding that well-connected moguls were able to gain ""monopolies"" over fuel, sugar, and other commodities. ""Others, who are less powerful, do not have this right,"" Abramian adds. ""Not all of these people are from Karabakh. It does not matter where they come from -- the most important thing is for them to serve the authorities."" Among those identified by analysts as part of the Karabakh clan are Kocharian's son, Sedrak, who reportedly controls mobile-phone imports; Barsegh Beglarian, who dominates the gas-station market; Mika Bagdasarov, who controls oil imports and heads the national airline; and Karen Karapetian, head of the Armrusgazard gas company, a joint venture with Russia's Gazprom. Closed Borders Abramian and other analysts say these oligarchs benefit from the lack of a final resolution to the Karabakh conflict and the closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan. ""This is one of the reasons why these issues are not being solved, because to have open borders with Europe, Asia, and so on -- in [that] case, the flows of goods, in either direction, will be wider, and it will be more difficult to control them,"" Abramian says. ""Now, however, when one narrow flow comes through Georgia and another, even narrower, comes via Iran, controlling these flows of goods is much easier."" Observers say such arrangements also stifle local production, hinder small business development, and ultimately harm the country's economy. And that is a major reason why one of Ter-Petrossian's main bases of support is among small and mid-level entrepreneurs. ""This kind of economy -- when the high-ranking officials are importing goods -- leads to these same officials not being interested in promoting local production,"" Grigorian says. ""And, because of this, it is in very difficult shape now. So during the elections, mid-size and big business wholly supported Ter-Petrossian."" There are slight cultural differences between native-born Armenians and those from Nagorno-Karabakh, according to analysts. Abramian says Karabakhians are more ""favorably oriented toward Russia,"" are more likely to speak the Russian language, and are less religious than Armenians, for example. He adds, however, that it is the dominance of Kocharian and Sarkisian's allies that has fueled resentment against people from Nagorno-Karabakh, few of whom have benefited from the largesse. ""Armenian people, our compatriots who live in Karabakh -- or, like me, have roots there -- have nothing to do with this,"" Abramian says. ""They are Armenians just like everybody else. However, two people who have kept power throughout a decade -- and plan to do so for many more decades -- they indeed provoked certain negative attitude within the Armenian population. For it was not only them, but their relatives, acquaintances -- tens, hundreds of them -- arrived here, and occupied high-ranking positions and had successful business careers. This triggers a natural reaction.""",,,

Officials on both side confirmed multiple casualties, including two Azerbaijani soldiers killed. The fighting appeared to be the most serious violation in years of the cease-fire agreement between Baku and Yerevan over the territory, which is dominated by ethnic Armenians and located within Azerbaijan. The mood in Armenia was already tense, with a 20-day state of emergency declared in response to opposition-led protests over a presidential election in mid-February. Skirmishes broke out in two separate districts of northwest Karabakh, with gunfire and shelling reported in three villages in the Terter and Goranboy regions. Armenian and Azerbaijani officials have each blamed the opposing side for initiating the clashes amid conflicting reports about how they began. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Azerbaijani forces were responsible for initiating a ""serious challenge to Armenian forces"" and suggested more substantial military hardware was involved than had been in any previous violations of the 1994 cease-fire agreement that brought an end to major hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh. Oskanian accused Baku of striking at a moment when Yerevan is particularly vulnerable, with the state of emergency in place since government troops and police forcibly dispersed opposition protesters in clashes on March 1 that left at least eight people dead. ""We condemn this challenge, and we think that this is an attempt by the Azerbaijani side to exploit the current situation in Armenia,"" Oskanian said. ""Perhaps they thought we had focused all of our attention on our internal situation, and that this could provide them with a psychological advantage, but this hasn't proved the case."" Baku, meanwhile, rejects the accusation from Yerevan, saying it was Armenian forces who began the fighting. Foreign Ministry spokesman Khazar Ibrahim told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service that he believed authorities in Yerevan devised the conflict in order to divert attention from the weekend chaos. ""This is a clear provocation by Armenia,"" Ibrahim said. ""They are trying to use the situation which is taking place in Yerevan after the elections and are trying to divert the attention of their citizens and population from the internal and domestic issues in order to seek an external enemy."" Tension has been chronic between Yerevan and Baku over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Internationally monitored negotiations to resolve the conflict have scored minor achievements, but a final resolution appears distant. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces clashed over the territory in a 1991-94 war that displaced some 600,000 Azeris and left as many as 25,000 people dead. Both sides continue to claim the territory as their own. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has used his country's mounting oil wealth to stoke tensions further. He has funneled more than $1 billion into bolstering the country's defenses. On a trip to western Azerbaijan on March 3, Aliyev told reporters that diplomatic efforts ""are not enough,"" adding that, ""to resolve the Karabakh conflict, we have to be strong, we have to be ready to liberate our lands by military means, and we are ready."" The U.S. State Department reports that between 30-40 people die each year in Karabakh as a result of violations of the cease-fire. If confirmed, however, these latest clashes would be the worst fighting seen in the disputed territory in years, and come at a particularly delicate time in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. Matthew Bryza, the U.S. co-chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group, which oversees negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh, is currently in Baku, as is Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk, the personal representative of the OSCE chairman in office.

Seven protesters and one police officer were reported killed in clashes late on March 1 after demonstrators defied a state of emergency and regrouped in a central square in the capital, Yerevan. Earlier in the day, police and Interior Ministry troops had used truncheons, tear gas, and electric stun guns to disperse thousands of opposition protesters. The weekend violence erupted at a point when the daily demonstrations had already begun to lose momentum, after swelling to at least 35,000 people earlier in the week. RFE/RL regional analyst Liz Fuller says the government, in authorizing the use of force, might have inadvertently given the protests a longer life than they would have had otherwise. ""They might not have died out for another week, or two weeks, or three weeks,"" she says, ""but if the authorities had simply turned a blind eye, I would think that within two weeks you would have seen a falling off in the number of people out there in the streets -- people would have simply given up hope."" The First Stone The government and opposition are now fighting over different versions of how the violence began. The police say they had to use force to quell a group of demonstrators who had looted downtown stores and were barricading streets with city buses and assembling gasoline bombs. The opposition, meanwhile, accuses the government of sending provocateurs into the crowd. Fuller calls ""exceedingly doubtful"" the authorities' claims that they were forced to act because protesters were gathering weapons. The timing of the first round of crackdowns, moreover, showed possible signs of forethought, she says. ""I think the timing of the initial police action was significant -- the early morning of the day before the presidential elections in Russia,"" she says. ""If everything had gone smoothly, without violence, then possibly the international community would barely have registered what had happened, and perhaps this is what the Armenian authorities were hoping for."" Media Blackout Incumbent President Robert Kocharian imposed a state of emergency following the initial wave of violence on March 1, 11 days after the contested vote. The state of emergency bans mass gatherings and requires media outlets to use only official information when reporting on the domestic political situation. It also restricts the movement of citizens and allows authorities to search vehicles. The measure has effectively muzzled the country's already largely compliant media. There has been virtually no news coverage inside Armenia regarding the clashes and deaths. (RFE/RL's Armenian-language broadcasts have been banned from the airwaves since March 1, and its website has been blocked.) Opposition figure Levon Ter-Petrossian, whose failed bid in the February 19 election sparked the protests, remains under virtual house arrest. His home is surrounded by police and he says he has not been permitted to leave the grounds. Ter-Petrossian has accused Kocharian of using the 20-day state of emergency to paralyze his ability to continue rallying the opposition. ""Losing the square means losing the connection to the people,"" he told reporters from his home on March 2. Kocharian's preferred successor, current Prime Minister Serge Sarkisian, won the election in a vote warily characterized by Western observers as basically free and fair. Ter-Petrossian and his supporters contest the official results, saying fraud and pressure were rampant and that he, not Sarkisian, is the rightful winner. Heikki Talvitie, a special envoy for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is continuing talks in Yerevan with Kocharian and Sarkisian on preventing further violence. In Washington, the State Department announced that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza would travel to Armenia to help ""facilitate discussions"" between the government and the opposition. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said that the United States does not want ""people to move from peaceful expressions of political opinions and engage in violence,"" but is in no way signaling its support for a crackdown.",,,0

Artur Baghdasarian, who finished third in Armenia's recent presidential election, has taken Sarkisian up on his offer to participate in a coalition government.While other members of his Orinats Yerkir party have attended and even addressed ongoing rallies against the outcome of the February 19 vote, Baghdasarian chose to stay away while also decrying the election as deeply flawed.But with his announcement on February 29 that he intends to take up the post of Security Council secretary in the next government came a clear reversal.""In the presidential elections of 2008, 1,100,000 people are standing behind the result of our political agreement, which is around 70 percent of the voters,"" Baghdasarian said.Sarkisian, in turn, was equally cordial toward his former opponent-turned-political partner. ""I think this [appointment] will give full opportunity to Mr. Baghdasarian to engage fully to the system of governance of our country, fully participate in the process of development of our country,"" he said.Despite the apparent boost Baghdasarian's decision will give to Sarkisian's efforts to gain acceptance for his first-round victory, second-place finisher Levon Ter-Petrossian is unlikely to drop his protest against the result.On February 28, the former president -- who insists election fraud prevented him from scoring a first-round victory -- told his supporters that ""the fate of democracy in Armenia is in the hands of the West."" He said Western election observers should choose between supporting the Armenian people, or a ""rotten, kleptocratic regime.""The election-observer mission of the Organization For Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in its initial assessment declared the election ""mostly in line"" with Armenia's international commitments, while also noting the need for ""further improvements.""The vote-counting process was assessed negatively at about 16 percent of the polling stations visited by observers from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).The elections have been endorsed by the European Union and the U.S. State Department has congratulated the Armenian people on an ""active"" and ""competitive"" election.On February 28, the U.S. Mission to the OSCE issued a statement noting ODIHR's assessment of the vote, but also expressing concern over problems cited in the election-observer mission's initial report and ""certain steps taken by the authorities in the post-election period.""The Armenian authorities have warned that their patience with the protests in central Yerevan is running out, and have alleged that those behind the rallies plan to seize power illegally. There is large police presence in the center of the capital, and government buildings and embassies remain cordoned off.Several prominent opposition figures close to Ter-Petrossian have been arrested. At least six have been placed in pretrial custody on a string of criminal charges, including illegal arms possession and assault.On February 27, Ter-Petrossian met in Yerevan with the EU special ambassador to the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, and told him that he intends to ""fight to the end,"" but also to act exclusively within the framework of the constitution and law.",,,0

Addressing some 10,000 supporters in Yerevan on February 26, Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, who according to official results won the February 19 presidential election with almost 53 percent of the vote, appealed to his defeated rival candidates and their supporters to cooperate, and possibly form a coalition government, but Ter-Petrossian responded just hours later by demanding that Sarkisian and outgoing President Robert Kocharian resign. Claiming that he received 65 percent of the vote, rather than the 21.51 percent confirmed as the final tally by the Central Election Commission on February 24, Ter-Petrossian has told supporters that he will leave Freedom Square, where his supporters have assembled daily since February 20, only to move into the presidential palace. Ter-Petrossian's rejection of the ballot as less than free and fair is not entirely unfounded, nor is the anger and resentment of many of the tens of thousands of Armenians who support him. The election monitoring mission organized by the OSCE and the Council of Europe registered the lack of a ""level playing field"" during the election campaign, in particular Sarkisian's use of the administrative resources available to him as prime minister and the equally blatant bias shown by pro-government media against Ter-Petrossian. The actual vote, too, was marred by isolated instances of violence, intimidation, and procedural violations such as ballot stuffing, while the vote count and tabulation was assessed as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" in 16 percent of polling stations where international observers were present. (The comparable figure for the preterm Georgian presidential ballot was 25 percent, and for the 2003 presidential election in Azerbaijan more than 50 percent.) On February 25, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), whose presidential candidate, Vahan Hovannisian, placed fourth with 6 percent of the vote, issued a statement implying that Ter-Petrossian's supporters too resorted to vote buying and other irregularities. Ter-Petrossian's supporters allege that the turnout figure of 1.7 million, or almost 70 percent of registered voters, was inflated, and that only some 1.1 million voters cast ballots. But it remains an open question whether, as Ter-Petrossian's supporters claim, the violations were of a magnitude to reduce Sarkisian's share of the vote to below the 50 percent plus one vote required to avoid a runoff. The mass popular support for Ter-Petrossian reflects not simply a rejection of an election outcome perceived to have been manipulated, thereby negating voters' legitimate choice. At another level, it is a protest against the widespread official corruption, embezzlement, and mismanagement that Ter-Petrossisan lambasted repeatedly in his campaign speeches. Speaking at a press conference on February 26, leading HHD member Armen Rustamian stressed that the Armenian leadership should be asking themselves the pertinent question: ""What have we done wrong, that so many people have aligned with Levon Ter-Petrossian?"" Finally, it is an expression of confidence in a man who spearheaded the drive for Armenia's independence, and who, while he undoubtedly failed during his six years as president to curtail similar corruption among his own entourage, is widely regarded as personally honest. To that extent, it reflects the degree to which politics in Armenia is dominated not by political parties or by issues, but by individual politicians. Despite the procedural violations registered during the voting and vote count by international monitors, the international community has accepted the election outcome as valid. Several heads of state have congratulated Sarkisian personally, although the U.S. State Department congratulated the Armenian people on holding an ""active and competitive ballot."" Both the U.S. State Department, and Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis in his capacity as president of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, and visiting Finnish Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairman in Office Ilkka Kanerva have praised the Armenian authorities' ""restraint"" in the face of the ongoing mass protests and stressed the need for the two opposing sides to resolve their differences within the framework of the constitution. In light of statements by the international community endorsing the official results of the ballot, the Armenian leadership has every incentive to avoid any escalation that could end in bloodshed. And Ter-Petrossian and his supporters risk forfeiting any international support they may be counting on if they embark in their demands for new elections on any action that could be construed by the authorities as an attempt to seize power. Outgoing President Robert Kocharian ordered senior military, National Security Service and Interior Ministry personnel on February 23 to take measures to avert any such ""unconstitutional"" moves. Meanwhile, a February 23 offer by defeated HHD candidate Hovannisian to mediate between the two sides has gone unregarded. Ter-Petrossian is almost certainly waiting for the Constitutional Court to respond to his formal appeal to invalidate the outcome of the February 19 vote and schedule new elections. The court must do so within 10 days of the appeal, which was made on February 25. He may also be hoping that more senior government officials will defect and join his camp, as some 10 Foreign Ministry personnel and two department heads from the Trade and Economic Development Ministry have already done. But the scale of those defections cannot be compared with the massive withdrawal of support, especially by 40 of the 96 deputies from the majority Hanrapetutiun parliament faction, that apparently proved decisive in impelling Ter-Petrossian to step down as president 10 years ago. Ter-Petrossian claimed on February 27 that ""thousands"" of civil servants and some members of the presidential administration are on his side, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Even if Ter-Petrossian did not plan from the outset to use in order to seize power the tactical and logistical skills in inspiring and mobilizing tens of thousands of people that he acquired 20 years ago as leader of the Karabakh Committee, his ignoring of Hovannisian's offer to mediate and his implicit rejection of Sarkisian's offer of cooperation only serve to substantiate Kocharian's allegations that this is his ultimate intention. As his rhetoric becomes bolder, and popular support for him shows no sign of abating, the options available to both sides for avoiding a violent confrontation are diminishing with each passing day.",,,0

They are loudly voicing their belief that former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, who finished second in the February 19 poll, lost only because the election was rigged. Ter-Petrossian has vowed to file a complaint with the Constitutional Court, and is demanding that a new vote be held. The protests have gained momentum in recent days, with several government officials coming out in support of the opposition. Many of them, including nine high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials, have reportedly resigned. In the last few days, several key opposition activists were arrested in separate incidents. Among those arrested were the leader of one political party and a former deputy prosecutor-general. Fears were raised that the authorities might resort to force to break up the peaceful protest after outgoing President Robert Kocharian held a meeting on February 23 with top military and security officials. He described the opposition protests as an ""attempt to seize power by illegal means"" and said that ""law and order"" was to be enforced. His instructions were followed up with the detention of the opposition figures on February 23-24 and with the deployment of a large police presence in central Yerevan on February 24. On February 23, police detained former Deputy Prosecutor-General Gagik Jahangirian, who had resigned in protest a day earlier. Gunfire was reportedly exchanged after officers stopped the vehicle in which Jahangirian was traveling, and authorities said a search of the vehicle uncovered four pistols and a hunting rifle. The next day, police detained Aram Karapetian, leader of the opposition party New Times, and politician Sambat Ayvazian, a former tax chief. Armenian officials said both Ayvazian and Karapetian were detained for possessing illegal weapons. The New Times' offices were subsequently searched and computers confiscated, according to RFE/RL's Armenian Service. RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported that Petros Makeyan, chairman of the opposition Democratic Homeland party, was detained early on February 25. The circumstances of his detention are unclear. ""I would evaluate the situation very negatively,"" says Mikael Danielian, chairman of the Armenian Helsinki Association. ""Even though the authorities are not resorting to wide use of force, these permanent arrests of Levon Ter-Petrossian's supporters -- which sometimes look like kidnappings, with the detainees allowed to meet their lawyers only the following day -- all this indicates that the authorities are trying to stifle the movement, by use of force."" RFE/RL Caucasus analyst Liz Fuller says the recent detentions may be part of the outgoing president's attempts to tie the protests to a conspiracy plot. If the allegations of illegal weapons possession ""are not true, then they are clearly intended to substantiate Robert Kocharian's allegations, when he met with police and army commanders on Saturday that Ter-Petrossian is plotting to seize power by illegal means, the implication being that he would not stop at violence,"" she says. Ter-Petrossian has claimed that the arrests are politically motivated. ""First of all, this is clearly political matter,"" he said. ""Apart from this, I think the authorities are trying to frighten other state officials, so that they do not follow Jahangirian's example."" Among the nine Foreign Ministry officials who have resigned are Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Bayburtian, and the ambassadors to Italy (Ruben Shugarian) and Kazakhstan (Levon Khachatrian). A diplomat posted in Ukraine, Razmik Khumarian, and a ministry spokesman, Vladimir Karapetian, were also dismissed. The opposition has vowed to make the protests a ""permanent feature"" in central Yerevan unless a new vote is held. But as analyst Fuller explains, the government seems willing to wait the situation out, believing it has the support of the international community. ""Serzh Sarkisian has a reputation as a gambler,"" she says. ""One would therefore suspect that he has very, very strong nerves, and he is waiting for the other side to blink first. I suspect that Sarkisian and Kocharian are firmly convinced that the international community is on their side, and that if they simply wait, in a week, or two weeks -- or even longer -- the protests will fizzle out."" In its preliminary assessment, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) election-monitoring body, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), has said the vote was ""mostly in line with the country's international commitments, although further improvements are necessary."" The vote-counting process was assessed negatively at about 16 percent of the polling stations visited by ODIHR observers. Nevertheless, the elections have been endorsed by the European Union and, while not congratulating Sarkisian personally, the U.S. State Department has congratulated the Armenian people on an ""active"" and ""competitive"" election, while also noting ""significant problems with electoral procedures.""

Meanwhile, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reports that a total of nine high-ranking officials with the country's Foreign Ministry have announced their resignations in protest of what they called the government's fraudulent conduct in the February 19 presidential elections. Official results from the poll gave 52.9 percent of the vote to Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian. But the main opposition challenger, former President Levon Ter-Petrosian -- who won 21.43 percent in the official tally -- has demanded a rerun, alleging that dozens of his activists were beaten and that ballot stuffing, multiple voting and voter intimidation were widespread. Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have described the presidential vote as ""mostly"" in line with international standards.

Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian has claimed that he is the rightful first-round winner of the February 19 ballot, which he alleges was tainted by widespread fraud, intimidation, and violence.Official results released by the Central Election Commission show that Sarkisian, who received vocal support from outgoing President Robert Kocharian, won nearly 53 percent (52.78) of the vote. Ter-Petrossian, who served as Armenia's first post-Soviet president before being forced to resign in 1994, received 21.5 percent.But on February 21, two members of the Central Election Commission representing opposition parties refused to endorse the official results, according to RFE/RL's Armenian Service.And on February 22, the opposition's stance was bolstered with the resignation of a deputy parliament speaker and support offered by a deputy prosecutor-general. The resignation of deputy parliament speaker Vahan Hovannisian came as a surprise, as he was considered to be relatively close to the government. He ran in the February 19 election as a candidate for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun.Explaining his disappointment in the way in which the elections were carried out, Hovannisian said, ""I made my personal decision and decided to resign.""Deputy Prosecutor-General Gagik Jahangirian also joined the fray, telling cheering demonstrators that, while he had seen many elections in Armenia, he had ""never seen the level of violations and violence as this time.""He told RFE/RL on February 22 that votes must be defended.

""You will have the right to complain only about yourself.""In a later interview, Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian's spokeswoman Sona Truzian requested that President Kocharian dismiss Jahangirian over his involvement in politics.The authorities have said that law enforcement bodies will be sent in to quell any violence or illegal actions in the course of the protests. But Ter-Petrossian has said the protests will remain peaceful. After the February 21 rallies, some supporters began pitching tents on Liberty Square, where the unsanctioned rallies are being held.Ter-Petrossian told his supporters the same day that two prominent generals with high-ranking posts in the Defense Ministry had assured him that they would not permit the army to be deployed against them.The claim that Deputy Defense Ministers Manvel Grigorian and Gallik Melkonian had made such promises has been denied by the Defense Ministry.

His nearest rival, Ter-Petrossian, had just 21.5 percent, and former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian finished in third place, with 16.6 percent of the vote. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) election monitors issued a lukewarm assessment of the vote, saying it was ""mostly in line"" with international commitments. The self-nominated Ter-Petrossian is alleging widespread violations during the vote, including ballot stuffing and physical intimidation and physical assaults on his supporters. Ter-Petrossian threatened ahead of the vote to take his grievances to the street, and his supporters gathered in the capital's central square, near the election commission's headquarters.

The most vocal were the two leading opposition candidates -- former President Levon Ter-Petrossian and former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian.After casting his vote in central Yerevan, the self-nominated Ter-Petrossian told RFE/RL that the election was fraught with violations, and predicted a first-round victory.Asked if he was happy with the way voting is going, Ter-Petrossian said, ""No, according to my information, a lot of bad things are taking place.""Later in the day, Ter-Petrossian's campaign secretary, Arman Musinian, expounded on the allegations. In addition to widespread cases of ballot-box stuffing and vote buying, he also claimed that dozens of the former president's supporters were beaten or intimidated at numerous locations in Yerevan. Separately, the campaign headquarters of Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based State) candidate Baghdasarian issued a statement in which it complained of voter intimidation and ballot-box stuffing and called on law enforcement authorities to investigate.There are also reported incidents of attacks on journalists. Ahead of the vote, Ter-Petrossian had vowed that he would rally his supporters to take to the streets for peaceful protest on February 20 in the event of vote rigging.After casting his vote at a public school early on February 19, leading candidate Serzh Sarkisian, who is the sitting prime minister and has received the backing of current President Robert Kocharian, said the integrity of the elections superceded the results.""For me, the most important thing is that these elections go well, and that people trust the results that emerge,"" Sarkisian said. Regardless of ""whether it's the first or second round.""A first-round victory would require more than 50 percent of the vote. Going into the election, such a result was viewed as a possibility for Sarkisian, while Ter-Petrossian and Baghdasarian were seen to be fighting for second place, which would place them against Sarkisian if the election were to go to a second round. Ahead of the vote, Tom de Waal, Caucasus editor for the London-based Institute For War And Peace Reporting, said the outcome of the election and the possibility of protests was difficult to predict.""I think it's actually quite a worrying situation in Armenia, because I think the opposition will probably not accept a Serzh Sarkisian victory in the first round, and I think they are already preparing to demonstrate against this,"" de Waal said. ""And so it's quite an unpredictable situation.""Welfare and social issues were the main domestic issues addressed by candidates during the campaign.Sarkisian touted the country's double-digit economic growth, in contrast to the dismal economy during Ter-Petrossian's reign as Armenia's first post-Soviet president.Ter-Petrossian, meanwhile, targeted widespread corruption, and promised a better and transparent future for a country in which more than one in four people lives below the poverty line.The status of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, over which Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a bloody war from 1988-94, was also a hot-button topic. Ter-Petrossian and Sarkisian have long-standing differences over how to tackle the issue of formally resolving the conflict.The issue has gained traction among voters after another so-called ""frozen conflict,"" that between Serbia and Kosovo, entered a new phase with Kosovo's declaration of independence on February 17.The initial results are expected on February 20, and the final results must be released within seven days of the vote.The vote is being monitored by hundreds of observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as dozens of monitors from the Council of Europe and other organizations.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079498.html,Armenia FAQ About Februarys Presidential Election ,"February 18, 2008 15:31 GMT",,,"Billboard in the capital touts candidate and current prime minister, Serzh Sarkisian (AFP) RFE/RL regional analyst Liz Fuller discusses some of the key questions and main candidates associated with Armenia's February 19 presidential election. There is virtually no expectation that the February 19 election in Armenia will be free or fair. Is there at least a degree of choice? The problem is that Armenia has had just one presidential election that was perceived as free and fair, and that was in October 1991 when Levon Ter-Petrossian was first elected president. In September 1996, when he came up for reelection, the results of the first round were rigged to preclude a runoff between him and his former Prime Minister Vazgen Manukian. Then, after Ter-Petrossian's ouster in 1998 and 2003 -- both times when the candidate of the party of power was Robert Kocharian -- on both occasions, the election went to the second round, and both times the opposition called foul and insisted that the ballot was rigged in Kocharian's favor. Therefore, people are not enthusiastic. Since Kocharian came to power ten years ago, a small group of people, a small elite, has accumulated enormous economic power. And it goes without saying that this small elite, clustered around Kocharian and Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, are not going to give up power, the huge fortunes and the economic influence that they have. And all the indications that we have seen in the past few months is that the authorities are preparing to engineer an outcome that would bring Serzh Sarkisian to power as president. The use of economic resources, the way that budget employees are being told 'if you don't vote for Serzh Sarkisian, then you won't get your salaries,' the way that the state-controlled media has consistently pushed Serzh Sarkisian's candidacy, while denigrating the rival candidates, in particular former President Ter-Petrossian."" How have Armenia's elections compared with others in the region in recent history? Armenia has had just one election that was seen as free and fair, and that was in 1991. Since then, all the elections in Armenia -- whether parliamentary or presidential -- have been marred by some degree of rigging, but not to the extent that the OSCE has come out and said ""these elections were not free and fair."" The formulation used has always been something like 'they were not totally consistent with the requirements for'... They were fudged. The degree of falsification in Armenia over the past 10 years has been less than in Azerbaijan, where the authorities have openly and blatantly moved to rig the elections. Even in the presence of OSCE observers, when the votes were being counted, they would manipulate and overstate the number of votes cast for either the incumbent president or the ruling party. [In] Georgia -- the 2004 elections that brought Mikhail Saakashvili to power were viewed as free and fair. But again, there were questions over last month's ballot, when Saakashvili, according to official returns, just managed by the skin of his teeth to win the reelection in the first round. So the entire region has a pretty checkered history. And the number of ballots that have been considered as free and fair has been minimal. Claiming he is the only true challenger, Ter-Petrossian has expressed his anger with opposition candidate Artur Baghdasarian's decision not to support him, and has said that Baghdasarian is essentially backing Sarkisian. Does Baghdasarian have a chance to make it to the second round in his own right? Yes, he does have a chance. He's the youngest candidate -- he's 39 -- he's charismatic, he's populist. He's made some very populist economic promises in terms of residing salaries and cutting taxes. The question is whether the authorities decide to go for broke and engineer and outcome in the first round that would preclude a second round; or whether they will finesse it and give Serzh Sarkisian just under 50 percent of the vote in the first round, in order to demonstrate that they are really being fair. In which case it would be very, very difficult to predict who the second candidate would be, whether it would be Baghdasarian or Ter-Petrossian, who apparently does have huge support. How much has the failure of the opposition to unite behind a single candidate harmed its chances against Sarkisian? It's very difficult to say, without having some idea of exactly how many people will turn out and vote, or how many people is so disenchanted that they won't vote. In a fair election, the failure to unite behind a single candidate could work in the opposition's favor, if all the opposition candidates together managed to deprive Sarkisian of the 50 percent in the first round. Do you expect the election to go to a second round? I honestly would not like to predict at this stage. There was an opinion poll conducted, I think, last week or the week before by a British company that gave Sarkisian marginally over 50 percent of the vote. And the margin of error is such that it's very difficult to say. It could go either way. Given that [in] the last two elections there has been a runoff, it would seem logical that there should be one this time round as well. Especially as this time you have two strong challengers -- you have Baghdasarian and Ter-Petrossian, rather than simply one. A cynic would say that whether or not there is a second round would depend wholly on whether or not a second round would make an ultimate victory for Serzh Sarkisian appear more natural or convincing. How is it that Ter-Petrossian, the man who oversaw Armenia's victory in Nagorno-Karabakh as president, is now perceived by his opponents as being ""defeatist"" on the issue of formally resolving the conflict? This perception has arisen from the way in which first, not so much Ter-Petrossian's rivals as commentators and even the international community have interpreted the comments that Ter-Petrossian made, first at a press conference in September 1997, and then in his long article called ""War Or Peace,"" which was published in November. In July 1997, the OSCE Minsk group came up with a draft peace proposal that Armenia accepted but Nagorno-Karabakh rejected. They came up with a second draft proposal in September -- again, Nagorno-Karabakh rejected it. It was because of these two rejections by the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians -- partly because of that -- that Ter-Petrossian began to argue 'look, time is not on our side; the only way to resolve this conflict is through a compromise; and the longer we wait to resolve it, the weaker Armenia will be economically, the stronger Azerbaijan will be economically. And, in five or 10 years' time, we could be in a position where the offer that's made to us is far less favorable than what's on the table now.' He didn't argue specifically for giving up any claims for Karabakh independence. The circumstances of Ter-Petrossian's resignation in February 1998 were always ambiguous. He never said, in his resignation speech, ""I am resigning because people don't like my Karabakh policy."" It was deliberately fudged, and everyone assumed that it was because Robert Kocharian and Serzh Sarkisian were opposed to the Karabakh policy that they decided to oust him. Ter-Petrossian's closest adviser has hinted that there were other reasons entirely, but he has never gone public with them. This is something we may never know, or we may only know it 10 or 20 years' time. Following a visit to Moscow last week, where he reportedly met with president in waiting Dmitry Medvedev, Ter-Petrossian claimed to have secured Russia's backing for his presidential bid. This followed a visit by Russian officials to Armenia, which was taken by many as evidence of the Kremlin's support for Sarkisian? How big a role does Russia's backing play in this election? It's not so much a question of Russia's backing, as that Russia has huge interests in Armenia. The Russian military base in Armenia is the only one that Russia has left in the South Caucasus, now that it's pulled out of Georgia. And secondly. Russia has huge economic interests in Armenia. The Russians have bought up most of Armenia's industrial enterprises that could be turned round and really made a profit. There's a big Russian economic interest there. Russia is interested in stability, and the last thing that Russia wants to see in Armenia is another Orange Revolution that would sweep Serzh Sarkisian away, and bring back Ter-Petrossian, possibly with a new team of people. Russia has a vested interest in seeing a smooth transition of power. We don't know for an absolute certainty that Ter-Petrossian actually did meet with Dmitry Medvedev, and we certainly don't know what sort of assurances -- if any -- Ter-Petrossian managed to get from the Russian leadership. I would suspect that his trop to Moscow was a P.R. stunt, and it may not have turned out the way he hoped it would. Ter-Petrossian has vowed to take to the streets on Wednesday if there is an attempt to falsify the vote. Sarkisian, meanwhile, has said that peaceful demonstrations will be tolerated but that any violence will be countered by law-enforcement ""with all its power."" How real is the threat of violence? It is not in the interest of either side -- either of Ter-Petrossian, or of the Armenian authorities -- for any potential standoff to degenerate into violence or bloodshed. Ter-Petrossian is already a legend, by virtue of the role that played in the Karabakh movement, and the fact that he was the first president of an independent Armenia. It's not in his interests to risk compromising that reputation by triggering violence. For that reason, I would suspect that Ter-Petrossian himself will be circumspect that if you have tens of thousands of people out there on the streets, rallying in your support, it's terribly, terribly easy for one of Ter-Petrossian's supporters to start throwing stones at police, and then for the police to react violently, and Ter-Petrossian would be blamed. I would very much hope that there is no violence. It's certainly not in the interests of Serzh Sarkisian for there to be violence. The Armenian authorities, one would hope, would have learned a lesson from the international community's reaction to the violence, suppression by police in Tbilisi last November of what were more or less peaceful protests. Both sides will need to keep a very cool head, and one would hope that there won't be any violence or bloodshed. What next for Kocharian? This is one of the big unanswered questions. There has been lots of speculation that Armenia would duplicate the Russian scenario, and that Serzh Sarkisian would appoint Robert Kocharian his prime minister after the election. But Serzh Sarkisian has not yet said anything, either that would even hint at that, let alone confirm that possibility. So this is simply one of the things they are going to have to wait and see how things turn out.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079496.html,Armenia Race For Presidency Offers New Debate Over Old Taboo ,"February 18, 2008 14:09 GMT",,,"Candidate Ter-Petrossian on the stump in early February (AFP) In many ways, Armenia's presidential election on February 19 is more about the past than the future. Ten years ago this month, Armenia's first president fell victim to a dismal economic situation and Nagorno-Karabakh. Having served one term and half of another at war with Azerbaijan over the Armenian-populated province, Levon Ter-Petrossian's calls for compromise were branded ""weak"" and ""defeatist"" by his political adversaries. And with those words, he was gone. ""The government bodies known to you have presented me a resignation demand,"" Ter-Petrossian said. ""Taking into account that the execution of the constitutional power of the president in the situation that has been created could pose serious danger to the stability of the country, I accept that demand and announce my resignation."" At the time, Ter-Petrossian said his resignation was due to ""deep problems"" connected with what he called ""the alternative between peace and war."" In short, he told Armenians, ""the party of peace and respectful reconciliation has been defeated."" Once Burned After 10 years in seclusion, where he quietly busied himself in academia, Ter-Petrossian returned to active politics in September to take on two of the men largely responsible for his ouster in 1998. One of them, Robert Kocharian, is now ending his second term as president. His preferred successor, fellow Nagorno-Karabakh native and current Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, is the second. Some Frequently Asked Questions about the vote through the eyes of RFE/RL analyst Liz Fuller With his return, Ter-Petrossian significantly altered the political status quo, dominated by Kocharian and Sarkisian. He has also provided new stimulus to one of the most emotional issues in Armenia: Nagorno-Karabakh. In an interview with RFE/RL on February 17, Ter-Petrossian stood by his view that international mediators' current proposals to end the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are remarkably similar to their 1997 peace plan, which he strongly advocated and which was rejected as ""defeatist"" by his political adversaries. ""After having wasted so many years, the current authorities of Armenia have quietly and secretly agreed to a plan that they had diligently presented as defeatist and treacherous in the past,"" Ter-Petrossian told a rally in Yerevan in October. The authorities argue that the current plan differs significantly from that plan in that it makes clear that Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be determined through a referendum on self-determination. And harkening back to 1998, Kocharian and Sarkisian routinely accused Ter-Petrossian of ""selling"" and ""betraying"" the disputed region 10 years ago to Azerbaijan, and warn that in the event of victory, Ter-Petrossian will ""surrender Karabakh."" Ter-Petrossian has countered by accusing Kocharian of complicity in ""great conspiracy against the republic of Armenia"" by agreeing in 1999 to a land swap with Azerbaijan. The purported deal, according to Ter-Petrossian, would have stripped Armenia of its vital land border with Iran in exchange for Nagorno-Karabakh. Ter-Petrossian backs his claim by saying Kocharian attempted to get then-Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian (no relation to Serzh) to accept the idea in the presence of a U.S. official, just hours before Vazgen Sarkisian and seven other officials were assassinated in parliament in October 1999. Ter-Petrossian alleges Sarkisian rejected the proposed peace deal with Azerbaijan and stormed out of the meeting. Kocharian, who has campaigned stridently in support of Serzh Sarkisian, strongly denies Ter-Petrossian's allegations about the alleged land-swap agreement. ""I don't swap Armenian land [for] Armenian land,"" Kocharian told major television stations on February 17. ""We have not lost a single square meter [of land] during my presidency."" Tom de Waal, Caucasus editor for the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting, calls the accusations ""exaggerated,"" saying they are more a reflection of electioneering than reality. ""This rehearsal of the plans from the past, which the public knows about, they are all coming out in the open.,"" de Waal says. ""Both sides are making rather exaggerated accusations, and both sides accusing the other of trying to sell Armenian interests. And it does very much look like electoral politics, more than the reality of the actual plans."" Competing Visions Much of the feuding between the two Armenian camps stems from differing approaches to settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that were considered after a cease-fire was reached in 1994. The so-called ""phased"" approach -- the advocacy of which played a major part in Ter-Petrossian's ouster -- calls for tackling the issue step-by-step. Among the issues that would have to be resolved before a settlement could be reached would be ensuring the security of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population, the return of tens of thousands of Azeri refugees, and the withdrawal of Armenian forces occupying seven Azerbaijani districts bordering Karabakh. The ""package"" solution -- initially backed by Kocharian and Serzh Sarkisian -- advocates resolving all outstanding issues in one fell swoop, with the aim of legitimizing Karabakh's secession from Azerbaijan. Aghasi Yenokian, a Yerevan-based political analyst, says that over time, the ""phased"" approach has emerged as the preferred basis for a solution. Interview: RFE/RL Talks To Ter-Petrossian ""History has shown that a package solution, as such, does not exist. Ten years have passed since Ter-Petrossian was removed from power. And throughout all these years, every initiative that emerged was based on a step-by-step principle,"" Yenokian says. ""The package solution was impossible, be it from a political or a technical perspective."" De Waal agrees, saying the main difference between the two political camps in Armenia today lies in their general approach to resolving the dispute. ""I think Ter-Petrossian is different in approach, he says that 'this is an issue in which time is not on our side, an issue which we never solved, issue which we have to tackle,'"" de Waal says. ""And I think this is the important difference, because the others are basically saying, 'Yes, we do want to solve the Karabakh problem, but, basically, we won the war, so let the other side do most of the talking, we are fairly comfortable.'"" This, de Waal adds, is the important distinction: ""It's not about the technical details, but about how urgently they think the problem needs to be solved."" The More Things Change... To some observers, the fact that the past is being so actively revisited during the presidential campaign could signal that the issue of resolving the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh through compromise with Azerbaijan may no longer be a taboo topic in the minds of the Armenian public. While Sarkisian is still widely considered the front-runner in the race, Ter-Petrossian's ability to attract tens of thousands of people to his rallies suggests that his views on Nagorno-Karabakh are not without considerable support. But Stepan Grigorian, director of the Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in Yerevan, notes that divisiveness on this ""very sensitive question"" leads Ter-Petrossian to tread carefully. ""Because of all this, in his campaign, Levon Ter-Petrossian, when speaking about the necessity to improve relations with Azerbaijan or the necessity to accept compromises in relation to solving of the Karabakh conflict, does not provide many details,"" Grigorian says. ""Because as soon as he tries to do this, a hostile campaign is launched against him, even though significantly large segments of society are now accepting the idea of compromise."" For de Waal, if the Armenian public appears more open to compromise on Nagorno-Karabakh, it has more to do with Armenians waking up to new realities than to any major shift in their feelings on the issue. ""I think 10 years ago -- when Ter-Petrossian gave his famous press conference, and then published an article called 'War or Peace,' talking about the need to compromise -- there was mass hostility to his ideas, partly because he did not make the case very well. He also said, 'There are only six people in Armenia who understand the Karabakh problem,' which was a statement that was guaranteed to annoy the public,"" de Waal says. ""Ten years later, I don't think things have changed that much, but maybe people are aware that Azerbaijan is going much stronger, their military budget is growing, that they have oil revenues. So I think maybe there is a little more acceptance in Armenia that this is a topic which won't go away, and that we should take another look at it."" De Waal stresses that the establishment of a real peace process over Nagorno-Karabakh is still a distant prospect, as Armenia's and Azerbaijan's positions remain far apart. ""This is a subject which is capable of mobilizing the public like no other issue in both countries,"" he notes. ""So it would be quite dangerous for any leader who wants to make any compromises on this issue. There will be demonstrations on the street, there will be threats. It will be a very, very difficult issue to handle.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079486.html,Armenia Will Murder Allegations Impact On Presidential Vote ,"February 15, 2008 18:23 GMT",,,"Levon Ter-Petrossian (Photolur) Mutual recrimination has been an integral component of electioneering at least since the elections to the Roman senate in the first century B.C. But while accusations of corruption, mismanagement, and inefficiency are commonplace, it is exceptional for a candidate openly to implicate one of his rivals in murder, as former Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian has done in the run-up to the February 19 presidential ballot. Addressing a campaign rally on January 24 in Charentsavan, Ter-Petrossian implicated outgoing President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, widely regarded as the favorite in the February 19 ballot, in the October 1999 parliament shootings in which a group of disaffected gunmen killed eight senior officials, including then-Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian and parliament speaker Karen Demirchian. Two weeks later, on February 9, Ter-Petrossian told tens of thousands of supporters in Yerevan that those two men were killed because of their objections to a U.S.-backed proposal for resolving the Karabakh conflict that would have entailed Armenia ceding its southernmost Meghri district in exchange for formal international recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Armenia. Ter-Petrossian claimed that Kocharian, Sarkisian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian all approved that option.Such allegations of a connection between the alleged proposed territorial exchange and the 1999 parliament shootings are not new: they were discussed in detail in the August 3, 2000, issue of the Armenian daily ""Aravot,"" and three months later, on November 10, 2000, Yerevan Mayor Albert Bazeyan claimed he had been recently informed by oppositionist Ashot Manucharian that the OSCE Minsk Group, which since 1992 has sought to mediate a solution to the Karabakh conflict, proposed such an exchange to Kocharian. According to Manucharian, Kocharian approved the idea but Sargsian and Demirchian opposed it, whereupon the OSCE co-chairs -- not the Armenian leadership -- engineered their deaths in the parliament shootings. Senior Armenian officials, including both Kocharian and Oskanian, have made no secret of the fact that a territorial swap was one of various approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict that has been discussed and then abandoned as unacceptable and/or unworkable. Kocharian disclosed in February 2000 that international mediators had again proposed the prospect of a territorial exchange to resolve the Karabakh conflict, and that he discussed that possibility during one of his meetings with his Azerbaijani counterpart Heidar Aliyev. But both Kocharian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian subsequently said repeatedly that the Armenian side rejected such a territorial exchange out of hand. On November 22, 2000, then-Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ara Papian was similarly quoted by ""Zhamanak"" as saying that the OSCE proposed a territorial swap first in 1992 and then in 1999, but that both the Armenian authorities and the leadership of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic rejected it on both occasions. A spokesman for Kocharian rejected Ter-Petrossian's allegation on February 9 as a cheap pre-election ploy. Then on February 13, Oskanian, who has served as point man for the Karabakh peace process since 1997, went on record as affirming that that none of the three draft Karabakh peace proposals submitted by the OSCE Minsk Group to the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan since Ter-Petrossian's ouster in February 1998 contained any mention of the possibility of Armenia ceding Meghri to Azerbaijan in exchange for international recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as Armenian territory. Oskanian pointed out that the idea of a territorial swap was the brainchild in 1992 of former U.S. State Department analyst Paul Goble, but that what became known as the ""Goble plan"" never figured officially as a component of any OSCE-drafted peace proposal. Oskanian accused Ter-Petrossian of acting immorally, suggesting that he ""will stop at nothing to achieve his political goal of [again] becoming president of Armenia,"" Novosti-Armenia reported.There is an element of irony in Ter-Petrossian's attempt to use Sarkisian's purported involvement in the 1999 parliament shootings and his alleged willingness to cede Armenian territory as a means of undermining his credibility with voters. Conventional wisdom has it that it was Ter-Petrossian's conciliatory approach to resolving the Karabakh conflict that motivated Kocharian, Sarkisian, and Vazgen Sargsian to engineer his forced resignation in February 1998, although Ter-Petrossian's former adviser Zhirayr Libaridian implied in his ""The Challenges of Statehood"" that other factors entirely were behind that decision.Even prior to Ter-Petrossian's February 9 allegations, Sarkisian warned that unnamed candidates who engage in slander will be held legally responsible once the election is over. But setting aside the moral and legal implications of Ter-Petrossian's statements, the question arises: why did he wait to go public with them until so late in the election campaign? Two days earlier, Ter-Petrossian filed a formal request with the Constitutional Court to order measures to remove ""obstacles"" to his campaign activities, specifically the consistently negative coverage of his campaign by major state-controlled television channels. Under the provisions of Armenia's election law, failure to remove such obstacles necessitates the postponement of the election by two weeks. The Constitutional Court on February 11 recognized Ter-Petrossian's complaint as valid and ordered the ""obstacles"" to be removed, but declined to order a postponement of the vote, after which Ter-Petrossian flew to Moscow where he reportedly met with top Russian officials. The purpose and timing of that trip is likewise puzzling: is Ter-Petrossian aware of some Russian involvement in the 1999 parliament shootings, and might he have presented Russian leaders with an ultimatum: drop your support for Serzh Sarkisian, or I go public with this damaging material?Two other factors may have influenced the timing of Ter-Petrossian's trip to Moscow: a fire during the night of February 8-9 badly damaged the top two stories of the Armenian Justice Ministry building, including much of the evidence and records from the investigation into the parliament shooting. Firefighters called to extinguish the blaze made only token efforts to do so, an eyewitness told RFE/RL. And second, February 9 was the last day on which any of the nine registered presidential candidates could step down and pledge their support for another. Despite rumors that he would do so, former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian failed to pull out of the race and endorse Ter-Petrossian, although RFE/RL's Armenian Service quoted him as saying on February 11 that he might still do so on February 15 or 16.It remains unclear how, eight years after the event, Ter-Petrossian's allegation of Sarkisian's partial responsibility for the parliament shootings will resonate with those voters who are still undecided. Ter-Petrossian's rival candidates, almost without exception, have focused primarily in their campaign statements on the need to eradicate corruption, raise living standards, and create new jobs, issues that are presumably closer to the hearts of much of the electorate than unsubstantiated allegations of murder and willingness to cede Armenian territory. Finally, even if widely held suspicions that Armenia's current elite fully intends to rig the outcome of the ballot to ensure the transfer of presidential power from Kocharian to Sarkisian are unfounded, some members of that elite may have been so angered by Ter-Petrossian's allegations that they might intervene in the process of vote tabulation to ensure that the official election results show minimal support for him.",,,

Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov tells RFE/RL that the PKK issue was the main focus of his talks on February 14 with visiting U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State on Terrorism Frank Urbanchik.""We suggested that this issue be watched closely,"" he says. ""These issues will be more broadly discussed, I believe, in the next round of talks between Azerbaijan and the United States.""Like Turkish officials, Azimov describes the PKK as a ""terrorist group."" But Azimov stops short of confirming Turkish state media reports that allege the PKK has already moved from northern Iraq into the Azerbaijani districts of Fuzuli and Lachin. Both of those districts have been occupied since the early 1990s by ethnic-Armenian forces who waged a separatist war in Azerbaijan's breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh.But Azimov does suggest that PKK fighters are moving closer to Azerbaijani territory. ""Lately, we have been watching [PKK] activities...very closely,"" he says. ""Due to the problems that Turkey is facing, we have been very vigilant. According to the information we are receiving from different sources, the activities of this organization are approaching our country.""More specifically, Azimov says the PKK is building ""close relations"" with ""terrorist groups and organizations"" that are enemies of both Turkey and Azerbaijan -- a remark seen in Baku as a reference to Armenia or ethnic-Armenian forces.Government officials in Yerevan have consistently denied Turkish media reports that PKK militants have moved into the districts of Azerbaijan that are occupied by ethnic Armenians.Independent and opposition media in Azerbaijan also report that PKK militants are now active in parts of Azerbaijan. Those reports alleged that ethnic-Kurdish officials in Azerbaijan's government have been backing the PKK -- a claim that Baku also denies.U.S. Regional ConcernsJonathan Henik, a public-affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in Baku, confirms that the United States and Azerbaijan have been discussing the threat of PKK militancy. He says most of Washington's previous discussions on the issue had been with Turkey or with European governments. But Henik says the United States is increasingly concerned about what appears to be growing ties between the PKK and other groups in the Caucasus that have been deemed terrorist organizations. He says Washington is also worried about the threat the PKK poses to energy infrastructure in the Caucasus. Click image to enlargeThose concerns focus on a 1,770-kilometer pipeline that carries Caspian oil from Baku through Georgia and on to southeastern Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.About 20 million ethnic Kurds are scattered mainly in northern Iraq, Syria, Iran, Turkey, and Azerbaijan.

More than 30,000 people have been killed in that fighting, most of them ethnic Kurds.Though the PKK declared a cease-fire in 1999, fighting by separatists resumed in southeastern Turkey in 2004. Authorities in Ankara fear that the Kurds in northern Iraq plan to set up their own state -- a move that would stir tensions and lead to increased calls for autonomy by Turkish Kurds.Turkish President Abdullah Gul raised the issue during talks at the White House in early January with U.S. President George W.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079457.html,NagornoKarabakh Azerbaijan Up For A Fight But Armenia Unbowed ,"February 08, 2008 16:37 GMT",,,"Ilham Aliyev (right) with his Armenian counterpart Robert Kocharian (Photolur) YEREVAN -- EU officials touring the South Caucasus this week were confronted by heated words from President Ilham Aliyev, who told them Azerbaijan is ready to ""wage war"" with neighboring Armenia over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan's recent windfall of oil and gas revenues appears to have persuaded Aliyev that he could turn the tables on Armenia, which has long held the military upper hand in the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic-Armenian territory located within Azerbaijan. In talks on February 4 with Slovenian Foreign Minister Dmitrij Rupel, who was representing the current EU Presidency, Aliyev indicated Baku was contemplating waging war for control of the disputed territory, which together with a strip of adjacent Azerbaijani territory has been under Yerevan's control since a 1988-94 war between the two countries. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU's external relations commissioner, tells RFE/RL that Brussels firmly rejected Baku's ""inflammatory"" rhetoric. ""I clearly said, not only to the authorities, but also at the press conference, that I think it is highly important that they avoid any inflammatory speech at the moment of presidential elections,"" she says.Both countries are holding a presidential vote this year -- Armenia on February 19, and Azerbaijan in October. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has spent more than 15 years mediating talks between the two sides, has indicated an election year is not likely to see major progress on the issue. Baku, however, appears impatient. The Azerbaijani leadership, Rupel said, appears to feel that ""time is not on Armenia's side."" Nor is money. Azerbaijan's defense budget this year will exceed $1 billion; Armenia's is just one-third of that figure. Azerbaijan has enjoyed spectacular economic growth over the past few years. The country's GDP grew by 25 percent in 2007, almost exclusively on the strength of oil and gas exports. Azerbaijan's minister for economic development, Heydar Babayev, says he expects his government to generate upward of $150 billion in oil and gas revenues by 2015.Armenia, meanwhile, has no lucrative natural resources. It is landlocked, blockaded by neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan, and -- at Baku's behest -- bypassed by oil and gas pipelines, as well as rail and road projects, which originate in Azerbaijan.'Winning The Peace'But, as Rupel notes, Armenia has ""alliances that speak for it."" This is a reference to Russian backing. Throughout the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia is rumored to have given Armenia military equipment worth $1 billion. Russia provides for most of Armenia's energy needs and has bought up most of its energy infrastructure.The Armenian government did not appeared cowed by Baku's fighting words. Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian tells RFE/RL that Armenia is confident of its military capability. ""No matter how strong the Azeris will be in the next 15 years, even with this kind of spending, even [if it] doubled every year, to catch up with Armenia's commitment to defend itself and Karabakh, that will require [as a] minimum 15-20 years,"" he says.Oskanian says that Armenia would not be intimidated in any event. More importantly, he adds, he does not believe there can be a military solution to Nagorno-Karabakh. ""We fought twice with the Azeris, we prevailed, but we never claimed that we won the war,"" he says. ""Unless we win the peace, we will never claim that we won the war.""Oskanian acknowledges, however, that the chances of ""winning the peace"" are receding and that Azerbaijan's positions in the OSCE-mediated peace talks have hardened.Rupel -- an old OSCE hand, having chaired the organization in 2005 -- also fears the Minsk Group, which oversees the mediation efforts, may face increasing obstinacy from Baku.Nagorno-Karabakh is a key issue in both countries' election campaigns, and establishment candidates are expected to win in both countries, meaning novel approaches to the problem are not likely to be forthcoming.Taking a longer-term view, Rupel says the conflict is rooted in the region's Soviet past, when Josef Stalin arranged their borders in a way apparently designed to exacerbate ethnic strife. Rupel says both Armenia and Azerbaijan need a ""generational change."" ""You know, a new generation, younger people, [would] deal with problems like Nagorno-Karabakh in an easier way,"" he says. ""I think we have to rely on a new generation of politicians on both sides. There has been some generational change in Azerbaijan, as you know. We'll see how it happens here [in Armenia]. Certainly, it is not a pleasant situation.""And what of the EU's role? Rupel says the EU's Neighborhood Policy is ""as balanced as possible"" between the two countries. The EU, he says, is ""very careful not to upset one side or the other,"" with even its economic assistance being as ""similar"" as possible.But money appears to be no object in this standoff.

Ambassador Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, the Dutch diplomat who heads the international vote-monitoring mission deployed in Armenia by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said Sarkisian's ""use of the position of prime minister in the election campaign"" could obstruct the proper conduct of the vote. ""There is no international rule that would prevent a prime minister from participating as a candidate in a presidential race,"" Ahrens told RFE/RL in an interview. ""But such a situation, of course, puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of the prime minister not to use his office to promote his candidacy."" ""Of course, it is a matter of concern when the line that should not be overstepped is being overstepped,"" he said. Sarkisian has come under opposition fire for capitalizing on his personal control -- and that of the Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) which he heads -- over many government bodies to gain extensive coverage by leading television stations and ensure high turnout at his campaign rallies across the country. Speaking in parliament on February 6, Sarkisian argued that the Armenian Electoral Code does not explicitly bar him from combining his prime-ministerial duties with election-related activities. ""As you know, elections in Armenia are monitored by numerous observers,"" Sarkisian said in response to a question from an opposition parliamentarian. ""And if the observers say that I, as you claim, have blatantly violated the law and inflicted great damage on the country, I will think about this issue."" Sarkisian went on to deny local media reports that schoolteachers, students, and other public-sector employees are forced to attend his campaign rallies. ""You can try and meet those people [attending Sarkisian's rallies] and ask whether they are kept there by police or army cordons,"" he said. ""The reputation of Armenia's future president is very dear to me and I will do everything in my power to ensure that Armenia's future president has a good reputation,"" a statement that seemingly reflects supreme confidence in his election chances. Addressing a cabinet session on February 7, Sarkisian warned the heads of local HHK branches local government officials to be scrupulously careful to comply with election-related legislation, Noyan Tapan reported. Sarkisian's campaign spending is another source of controversy. According to the Central Election Commission, it totaled 26.3 million drams ($85,000) as of January 31, well below the 70 million-dram limit set by the Electoral Code. Opposition politicians dismiss the figure as fraudulent, saying that such a modest sum could not have enabled Sarkisian to flood Yerevan and just about every Armenian town and village with his campaign billboards and posters. Ter-Petrossian's camp has also cried foul over Sarkisian's December 4 decision to form a special government commission to address citizens' grievances, saying that its activities amount to vote buying. They claim that voters needing financial and other assistance are being referred to the commission by Sarkisian's campaign offices. Ter-Petrossian on February 5 accused the OSCE observers of turning a blind eye to this and other alleged violations. ""They don't see or don't want to see that,"" he said. ""At least, there have been no preventive steps, no statements on their part."" Ahrens, however, said the observer mission is looking into Ter-Petrossian's claims. ""If this is the case, then this would of course be a way of using administrative resources that would not be acceptable,"" he said. Ahrens also expressed concern about violence that marred a Ter-Petrossian election rally on February 6 in Artashat, 30 kilometers south of Yerevan. A group of pro-government youths there scuffled with Ter-Petrossian's loyalists and pelted them with stones in an apparent attempt to disrupt the gathering. Ter-Petrossian condemned the incident, which was witnessed by two OSCE observers, as a government ""provocation"" aimed at derailing his campaign. Law-enforcement authorities claimed, however, that Ter-Petrossian and his allies themselves provoked it by making ""offensive"" remarks about Deputy Prime Minister Hovik Abrahamian, Sarkisian's Artashat-based campaign manager. ""We will certainly investigate this incident,"" Ahrens said. ""We have long-term observers everywhere in the country. They will talk to all those involved and then submit a report to us. Then on that basis we can form our judgment on this incident."" ""Whoever is to blame, any such incident is deplorable,"" he added.",,,

Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, who is one of eight opposition candidates running against the heavily favored Sarkisian, wrote to the Constitutional Court to complain about the ""insurmountable obstacles"" his campaign has encountered at the hands of the authorities. Specifically mentioning the negative coverage he has received over the past three months from Armenian State Television, Ter-Petrossian formally asked the court to remove those obstacles.If the court, chaired by a man who served as vice president in Ter-Petrossian's administration in the early 1990s, rules in his favor, the February 19 election could be postponed for two weeks. If after that time the obstacles have still not been removed, a new election must be scheduled after a 40-day interval. Just ahead of Ter-Petrossian's move, international election observers, too, voiced their concerns about Sarkisian's heavy reliance on government levers in his campaign, and pledged to investigate a brawl that nearly disrupted a campaign rally by Ter-Petrossian. Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, the head of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's international election-monitoring mission deployed in Armenia, tells RFE/RL that Sarkisian's ""use of the position of prime minister in the election campaign"" could hamper the proper conduct of the vote.""There is no international rule that would prevent a prime minister from participating as a candidate in a presidential race,"" Ahrens says. ""But such a situation, of course, puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of the prime minister not to use his office to promote his candidacy.""Sarkisian has denied accusations that his position as prime minister and his Republican Party's powerful role in the government has led to unfairly extensive television coverage and the abuse of administrative resources. Replying to a question posed by an opposition parliamentarian, Sarkisian this week pledged to do everything in his power to ""ensure that Armenia's future president has a good reputation.""""As you know elections in Armenia are monitored by numerous observers,"" Sarkisian said. ""And if the observers say that I, as you claim, have blatantly violated the law and inflicted great damage on the country, I will think about this issue.""Sarkisian is the anointed successor of incumbent President. Robert Kocharian, who is barred from seeking a third term under the constitution. Since announcing his candidacy, most observers have considered a Sarkisian win to be inevitable.Other candidates vying for the post are Artur Baghdasarian, a former parliament speaker who was forced to resign after feuding publicly with the president over NATO membership; Vahan Hovannisian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun; and National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian, who ran unsuccessfully in the presidential elections in 1998 and 2003.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079399.html,Armenia Presidential Campaign Gets Under Way ,"January 25, 2008 16:07 GMT",,,"The nine candidates in the February 19 presidential ballot made public their respective manifestos and held their first meetings with voters on January 21, the first day of the election campaign. Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian was the first to hit the campaign trail, with other major opposition candidates contenting themselves with news conferences and other indoor meetings. For his part, Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, widely regarded as the frontrunner, visited several of his campaign offices in Yerevan on January 21, before heading the following day to the southern district of Vayots Dzor, where he assured voters that if elected, he will double household incomes within five years. Ter-Petrossian spent January 21 touring towns and villages in central Armenia in a motorcade of about 40 cars that carried leaders of various opposition groups who support his presidential bid. His meetings attracted considerable interest from local residents who turned out to hear their former president speak publicly for the first time in over a decade. Addressing a crowd of several hundred at his first meeting in the town of Artik, the starting point of the campaign swing, Ter-Petrossian recalled the severe hardships people suffered during the first years of Armenia's independence, which coincided with the war in Nagorno-Karabakh and broader turmoil in the region. ""I know that during my rule I did not live up to all of your expectations and hopes,"" he said. ""There were disappointments, there was discontent, there were very harsh criticisms. I accept all of that.... And if you think that I am to blame for that, I apologize for my guilt,"" Ter-Petrossian added. The ex-president issued a similar public apology at a big rally in Yerevan last November. He made it clear at the same time that he believes that the deprivations of the early 1990s were the inevitable cost of the Armenian military victory over Azerbaijan. ""I have not come here to ask or beg for votes. That's Serzh's business because he has no votes in Armenia,"" Ter-Petrossian claimed on January 21, prompting chants of ""Levon! Levon!"" from the crowd. Ter-Petrossian again sounded supremely confident of his victory as he spoke at a similar rally held in another small town, Aparan. ""It's you, not me, who will win on February 19,"" he claimed in the town square opposite Sarkisian's local campaign headquarters. ""I congratulate you on your victory in advance."" Ter-Petrossian's campaign office in Aparan is run by Razmik Petrosian, a former town mayor and a veteran of the Karabakh war. ""Ter-Petrossian remains my commander-in-chief,"" he told RFE/RL. Other local residents too evoked Ter-Petrossian's wartime leadership of the country. ""We have had only one victor in our history and that person is Levon Ter-Petrossian,"" said one man. ""I will vote for Levon because he is an intelligent man,"" said another. On January 22, thousands of Ter-Petrossian supporters braved freezing weather to stage a rally in Yerevan's Freedom Square followed by a march through the city streets. Addressing the rally, Ter-Petrossian again branded Armenia's leadership ""a thieving and anti-popular regime"" and said he and his political allies are ready to suffer ""any deprivation and sacrifice"" for the sake of regime change. ""We have reached a turning point where words end and deeds take hold,"" he said, describing the February 19 election as a ""real opportunity to build a normal state."" Another major opposition contender, former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian, kicked off his campaign under the slogan ""A civic movement for new Armenia,"" with an official presentation of his 32-page election manifesto in Yerevan. ""My victory will eliminate corruption and embezzlement rooted in the country,"" he told journalists and activists of his Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based State) party on January 21. ""My victory will mean equality before law, a drastic rise in the living standards of the people of Armenia."" Baghdasarian dismissed claims by government loyalists that the Armenian opposition cannot prevent the handover of power from outgoing President Robert Kocharian to Sarkisian because it has failed to close ranks and back a single presidential candidate. ""There are and there will be alliances,"" he said without elaborating. ""As for the authorities, they are not united either,"" he added, pointing to the participation in the ballot of a candidate from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation -Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), a junior partner in the governing coalition. HHD candidate Vahan Hovannisian held a similar campaign event in Yerevan later on January 21 at which he listed as his primary objectives dismantling the existing system of economic monopolies, promoting intensive economic development, increasing exports, enhancing the role of the armed forces, and securing the participation of representatives of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the ongoing talks aimed at resolving the Karabakh conflict, Noyan Tapan reported on January 22. Also meeting journalists on January 21 was another opposition candidate, National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian. Rather than outline his campaign program, Geghamian again focused on attacking Ter-Petrossian and denouncing what he called a ""barbaric"" smear campaign waged against him by opposition newspapers. Some opposition media outlets have suggested that Geghamian was bribed by the authorities to enter the fray with the sole aim of discrediting Ter-Petrossian. Geghamian's opposition credentials were also questioned over the weekend by the Zharangutiun (Heritage) party of Raffi Hovannisian (no relation to Vahan), a major opposition group that has so far declined to endorse any of the presidential hopefuls. ""Mr. Geghamian's recent political behavior raises questions about his being in opposition and reinforces the government's positions,"" Hovsep Khurshudian, a Zharangutiun spokesman, told RFE/RL.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079371.html,Armenia Mutual Animosity Mistrust Overshadow Presidential Election ,"January 18, 2008 16:02 GMT",,,"The Armenian presidential election on February 19 will determine whether incumbent President Robert Kocharian, who is barred by the constitution from serving a third consecutive term, succeeds in handing over power to his anointed successor, Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, whose Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) won a majority of seats in the parliament elected in May 2007. Six months ago, Sarkisian's victory in the first round of voting seemed beyond doubt in light of his control of administrative resources and the absence of any credible challenger, but the October decision by Kocharian's predecessor Levon Ter-Petrossian to participate in the ballot opens the possibility that, as was the case in 1998 and 2003, a runoff will be required. Ter-Petrossian's decision also effectively demolished the possibility that the opposition might field a single challenger to Sarkisian. The leaders of five opposition parties met in August 2007 to explore that option, but failed to reach any agreement. Ter-Petrossian, who is 63 and an oriental scholar, spent a decade in obscurity writing a history of the Crusades after being forced by Kocharian and Sarkisian in February 1998 to resign. In two key addresses, on September 21 and October 26, announcing his comeback bid and intention to run for president, Ter-Petrossian excoriated the present leadership as ""an institutionalized mafia-style regime that has plunged us into the ranks of third-world countries"" and jeopardized all chance of achieving a settlement of the Karabakh conflict on terms acceptable to Armenia. He further accused Kocharian, Sarkisian, and their inner circle of personally controlling the most lucrative forms of economic activity through direct ownership of businesses or ""state racketeering."" Kocharian retaliated on October 31, accusing Ter-Petrossian and his Armenian Pan-National Movement of destroying the country's economy within a few years of coming to power and bequeathing him in 1998 ""a country with a ruined economy."" Sarkisian for his part on November 10 advised Ter-Petrossian to ""repent and apologize to the Armenian people"" for his errors. Then on November 16, Ter-Petrossian apologized to the Armenian population for having committed ""disastrous errors of judgment,"" during his tenure as president from 1991-98, of which he identified as the most serious having brought Kocharian and Sarkisian from Nagorno-Karabakh to occupy senior posts in the Armenian government. Even before that, Armenian tax and law enforcement agencies began systematically harassing people and media outlets that openly supported Ter-Petrossian. Last month, tax inspectors impounded thousands of campaign flyers as a member of Ter-Petrossian's campaign staff took delivery of them from a Yerevan printing firm. Noyan Tapan's veteran political commentator David Petrossian noted in a December 2 analysis that Ter-Petrossian's campaign team was distributing DVDs of his addresses of September 21 and October 26 in a bid to obviate the refusal of virtually all Armenian television channels to give him air time. Of a total of 12 candidates who initially sought to register, nine succeeded in doing so. U.S.-born former Foreign Minister and Zharangutiun (Heritage) party Chairman Raffi Hovannisian was denied registration on the grounds that he acquired Armenian citizenship only in 2001; Armenia's election law stipulates that presidential candidates must have been citizens of the Republic of Armenia for a minimum of 10 years prior to the ballot. Zharangutiun subsequently declined to throw its support behind another candidate. Nor Zhamanakner (New Times) party leader Aram Karapetian was similarly denied registration as he has not lived permanently in Armenia for the past decade. No explanation was given as to why that requirement did not render him ineligible to register for the 2003 presidential election, in which he polled fourth with 2.95 percent of the vote. In addition to Sarkisian and Ter-Petrossian, the remaining seven candidates are Orinats Yerkir party Chairman Artur Baghdasarian, who was constrained to resign as parliament speaker in May 2006 following a public polemic with Kocharian over NATO membership; opposition National Democratic Union Chairman Vazgen Manukian, who served under Ter-Petrossian in the early 1990s as defense minister and prime minister and was his main challenger in the 1996 presidential election; Vahan Hovannisian (no relation to Raffi) of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), whose party, although aligned with the HHK-led coalition government, declined to back Sarkisian's candidacy; National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian, who ran unsuccessfully in the presidential elections in 1998 and 2003; People's Party Chairman Tigran Karapetian; National Accord Party (AMK) Chairman Aram Harutiunian; and Arman Melikian, who was foreign-policy adviser to Arkady Ghuksian, the former president of the unrecognized republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. Of those seven, two -- Geghamian and Hovannisian -- are vying to be acknowledged as the ""third force"" capable of creaming off enough votes to deny the frontrunner the 50 percent-plus-one vote required for a first-round victory and thus force a second round, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on December 13. Hovannisian told journalists that ""it is unfortunate that Armenia is entering the election period with two hostile poles.... A three-horse race will totally change the situation. It will expose the real force."" At the same time, Hovannisian implied that the HHD will not pull out of the government in the event that he is elected president. While Hovannisian has every reason to resent both Ter-Petrossian, who banned his party in December 1994 and had Hovannisian arrested on terrorism charges, and Sarkisian, who as Ter-Petrossian's interior minister was personally involved in that crackdown, he nonetheless hopes for a strong election showing that would cement the HHD's position within the coalition government. Geghamian's primary motive in registering for the ballot was to thwart Ter-Petrossian's comeback plans, AMK Deputy Chairman Aleksan Karapetian told journalists on November 27. Geghamian has repeatedly attacked Ter-Petrossian as a ""political lightweight"" whose loyalists he claims plan to provoke violent unrest at polling stations and thus unleash ""civil war,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on December 13. Some observers believes Geghamian's campaign is being financed by Sarkisian with the aim of splitting the opposition vote. Opinion polls, however, show that Baghdasarian stands the greatest chance of forcing Sarkisian into a runoff. An impressive number of small political parties and public organizations have nonetheless pledged support for Ter-Petrossian, including former Prime Minister Aram Sargsian's Hanrapetutiun party and the People's Party of Armenia headed by Stepan Demirchian, who lost to Kocharian in the second round of the February-March 2003 presidential election. But several other opposition leaders clearly share Geghamian's misgivings about the former president. Both Manukian and Baghdasarian rejected Ter-Petrossian's November 16 appeal for their support. Manukian told journalists in Yerevan on November 20 that while he would dearly like to see the present Armenian leadership replaced, he does not think a return to power by Ter-Petrossian would improve the situation. ""There are people who consider Levon Ter-Petrossian the lesser evil, but there are also many, many people who consider Serzh Sarkisian the lesser evil. And I don't rule out the possibility that if Levon Ter-Petrossian and Serzh Sarkisian go into a second round, Serzh Sarkisian will emerge as the legitimate president,"" Manukian said. Manukian was pessimistic about the chances of any opposition candidate defeating Sarkisian given the latter's control of ""administrative resources, financial resources, and the entire election process."" In mid-December, the pro-Ter-Petrossian newspaper ""Haykakan zhamanak"" published what it claimed were excerpts from Manukian's private papers confiscated by security forces during the crackdown that followed the 1996 presidential election. The notes allegedly made by Manukian stress the need to recruit informers within the government during the election campaign to provide him with confidential information and advocate heightening existing tensions, if necessary by resorting to assassinations and acts of terrorism in the run-up to the vote. The HHD distanced itself from Ter-Petrossian in late October, when the party's de facto head Hrant Markarian dismissed Ter-Petrossian's criticisms of the present leadership as too radical and lacking in self-criticism, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on October 30. In his landmark address of November 1, 1997, analyzing the prospects for resolving the Karabakh conflict, Ter-Petrossian defined the choice facing Armenia as between ""the bad and the [even] worse."" Many Armenians who recall the economic collapse they experienced during Ter-Petrossian's presidency and the allegations of spectacular corruption surrounding some of his close associates may now view the upcoming presidential ballot in the same terms.",,,

In its annual ""Freedom Of The World"" report released today, the New York-based group Freedom House found that one-fifth of the 193 countries it studied suffered setbacks last year. None of the states that earned the lowest designation, ""not free,"" in 2006 showed any improvement last year, and it was the first time in the report's 15-year history that a two-year decline had been recorded.The countries of the former Soviet Union were among the worst performers, with parliamentary elections late in the year in Russia, rated ""not free,"" highlighting the perilous environment in the region's most influential state.""It's fair to say that freedom is seriously lacking in this region or unit, that is to say the former Soviet Union,"" Freedom House Director of Studies Chris Walker told RFE/RL. ""Of the 12 non-Baltic former Soviet republics, seven of those are assessed by Freedom House as 'not free,' four are 'partly free,' and one is 'free' [Ukraine]. So, it's a very challenging landscape for freedom in that part of the world.""Belarus, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are among the ""worst of the worst"" countries in the world in terms of human rights, and are joined on the list of ""not free"" countries by Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.Two countries looked upon as examples of positive democratic change, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, both rated ""partly free,"" took steps backward -- with Russia's influence in obstructing reforms being noted in the case of Kyrgyzstan.""There were big hopes for Kyrgyzstan and Georgia that if new people came to power, then [the new governments] would apply democratic principles by their actions and pressure [on the opposition] would stop,"" Ilim Karypbekov, director of the Media Representative Institute in Kyrgyzstan, tells RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service. ""However, if you look at Georgia, protest rally participants were beaten up again,"" Karypbekov continues. ""At the same time, international observer missions showed that the [Georgian presidential] election was held under enormous pressure [on the opposition] and with the use of administrative resources. The same happened in Kyrgyzstan's [early parliamentary elections in December 2007].""Joining Kyrgyzstan and Georgia among the former Soviet states considered ""partly free"" were Armenia and Moldova.The best of the bunch is Ukraine, which Walker says remains ""free"" because it has competing factions with well-defined positions, and a population that accepts the results of well-conducted elections.Democracy in Georgia, rated ""partly free,"" suffered in 2007 due to President-elect Mikheil Saakashvili's ability to dominate the political scene. The imposition of a state of emergency and a violent police crackdown on opposition rallies late in the year served to highlight the country's problems, according to Freedom House, but Walker notes that there is room for vocal dissent in the country.'A Semblance Of Freedom'Russia is a different matter altogether, according to Walker.""2007 was a pivotal year for authoritarian consolidation in Russia in part due to the manipulated parliamentary elections in December, and the managed succession process which really revealed itself by the end of the year where it became very clear that there would not be an opportunity for ordinary Russians to have an open and fair selection of their next president,"" Walker says.A man in Nizhny Novgorod, who requested anonymity, tells RFE/RL's Russian Service that ""I've never been to other countries, so I can't say how the situation in our country is different from theirs. But compared to the Soviet Union, I don't see any radical changes.""""We never had freedom even though they tried to create it in the 1990s,"" the man adds. ""What we are left with now, at least in my opinion, is a semblance of freedom.""A man in Yekaterinburg, meanwhile, tells the service that freedoms in Russia cannot be compared with those in European countries.""I think we're at the level of Central Asian countries where rights and freedoms basically exist on paper but in reality [are not upheld],"" he says. ""The presidential election campaign has exceeded all limits because there is a cult of personality, and that is taking us back to the past.""Of the former communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe, most advanced on the road to freedom, according to the report. Only Latvia -- rated ""free"" -- and Bosnia -- rated ""partly free"" -- showed signs of moving backward during 2007.Aneta Grosu, editor in chief of the weekly investigative magazine ""Ziarul de Garda,"" describes the situation in Moldova, which retained its ""partly free"" rating.""Year by year it is more difficult with freedoms in Moldova: with press freedom, freedom of different opinions, human rights,"" Grosu tells RFE/RL's Romania-Moldova Service. ""And for us, journalists, it is more and more difficult to do our job in these circumstances. Access to information is more limited, there is tougher punishment for what the authorities call libel, sometimes we face threats or acts of revenge from people we write about.""The report characterized Iran as ""not free"" and called it a ""dictatorship,"" accusing it of not only suppressing the rights of its people, but also of imposing its influence on other countries through the support of Muslim militants.Iraq, too, is rated ""not free"" because it has limited freedom, given the persistent sectarian fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims that poisons daily life in much of the country.Government BacklashWalker says the annual report is meant to be studied by all those with influence in the countries that are rated, from government officials to members of the local news media. The point: to spark debate about how freedoms can be improved.Sometimes, however, governments react with hostility, Walker says, again pointing to Russia as an example.The work of nongovernmental organizations, including Freedom House, has been increasingly scrutinized in Russia, which argues that some countries use such entities work to spread their influence in Russia.Recently Russia opened branches of its own Institute of Democracy and Cooperation in Paris and New York, with the intention of improving Russia's image abroad.The organization's chairman, Anatoly Kucherena, recently told ""The Moscow Times"" that the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation has ""no desire to copy the behavior of organizations like Freedom House...which has only one goal: to publish data which was assembled using methodologies that nobody understands, in order to draw attention to themselves.""Walker says that ""attacks on our findings"" aren't based on the substance of the report.And, he says, too often governments criticized in the report fail to debate such findings with the country's opposition.""The local civil society in the country like Russia should have a right to talk about these findings without fear of reprisal and the hope is that it will help identify areas of concern, areas where there are problems, areas where there are possibilities for improvement so that domestic institutions can take the steps to make those improvements,"" Walker says.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079335.html,Armenia Former President Unveils Election Manifesto ,"January 10, 2008 10:36 GMT",,,"Former President Levon Ter-Petrossian made public on January 7 his election campaign manifesto for the presidential ballot on February 19, pledging to turn Armenia into a ""normal"" state where governments are formed as a result of free elections and respect laws, human rights, and free enterprise. The 16-page document also reaffirms his earlier bitter criticism of the country's current leadership, affirming that an election victory for Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian's would be ""tantamount to a national disaster."" One week earlier, Ter-Petrossian's national campaign headquarters, to be managed by former Foreign Minister Aleksandr Arzoumanian, opened in Yerevan. Its coordinating council, which comprises representatives of some of the opposition parties allied with Ter-Petrossian, held its first meeting and appointed the heads of its territorial branches in Yerevan on December 29. As of January 8, Ter-Petrossian has opened local election headquarters in each of Armenia's 11 marzes (provinces), Noyan Tapan reported. It was decided that the Ter-Petrossian campaign in Yerevan will be run by Khachatur Sukiasian, a wealthy parliamentarian who has been facing a government crackdown on his businesses ever since expressing support last September for Ter-Petrossian's comeback bid. Sukiasian will oversee the work of Ter-Petrossian campaign offices in each of the city's 10 administrative districts. Among the heads of those offices are former Interior Minister Suren Abrahamian and Pargev Ohanian, a prominent judge who was controversially dismissed by President Robert Kocharian last fall after acquitting two businessmen who accused the State Customs Committee of corruption and extortion. Ter-Petrosian's preelection speeches so far have analyzed in depth controversial episodes from his 1991-98 presidency as well as the current Armenian government's track record. Those evaluations, coupled with a retrospective look at the last few decades of Armenian history, make up a large part of the published manifesto. Ter-Petrossian, who turned 63 on January 9, again denounces the Kocharian administration as a corrupt and criminal regime that tolerates no dissent and is motivated by self-enrichment at the expense of a downtrodden population. The document also lays out his vision for Armenia's future. It says that, if elected, Ter-Petrossian will strive for the ""dismantling of the existing kleptrocratic system"" and the establishment of ""full-fledged democracy"" anchored in free elections, protection of human rights, and judicial independence. In addition, law-enforcement bodies and the military would no longer be used as tools for government repression. Ter-Petrossian's longtime critics, however, see few fundamental differences between him and Armenia's leaders. They point, among other things, to the Ter-Petrossian administration's failure to hold a single election recognized as free and fair by the international community. Ter-Petrossian's socioeconomic agenda is based on three key principles of market-based economics that he believes are absent in Armenia: a level playing field for all businesspeople; fair economic competition; and absolute protection of private property. While pledging to retrieve what he says are huge amounts of money ""stolen from the people"" by wealthy businessmen with ties to the government, Ter-Petrossian says that if elected, he would not seek a massive ""redistribution of property."" Ter-Petrossian further commits himself to launching a crackdown on widespread tax evasion that he says should primarily target large corporate taxpayers that are believed to grossly underreport their earnings thanks to government patronage. ""According to foreign experts, only 22 percent of the state budget's tax revenues is currently paid by large entrepreneurs, whereas [that proportion] should have stood at 75 percent,"" his campaign platform claims. In that regard, the document reaffirms Ter-Petrossian's pledge to help abolish a government-drafted law that took effect on January 1 and that will make it much harder for small Armenian firms to qualify for so-called ""simplified tax."" Payment of that tax has exempted them from other, heftier duties. According to Ter-Petrossian, these and other economic measures contained in his platform would double Armenia's gross domestic product and triple its state budget in the next five years. ""Needless to say that in the event of the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the lifting of the economic blockades [of Armenia,] and the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border, much more impressive results could be expected,"" reads the platform. During the 1996 presidential election campaign, members of the Ter-Petrossian leadership poured scorn on rival candidate Vazgen Manukian's pledge to raise GDP by a similar amount. Responding to Ter-Petrossian's grave allegations, Kocharian and Sarkisian have been particularly scathing about his handling of the first years of Armenia's painful transition to the free market. The Armenian economy shrunk by half in 1992-93 following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of wars in Karabakh and elsewhere in the South Caucasus. Kocharian has charged that the Ter-Petrossian administration was primarily responsible for turning Armenia into ""one of the poorest countries"" in the world. In his manifesto, Ter-Petrossian reaffirms his belief that the collapse of the Soviet economy was inevitable and that it was more drastic in Armenia than in other former Soviet republics because of the Karabakh war and the crippling blockades imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as turmoil in Georgia. But he admits that many Armenians do not and will not accept this explanation. ""When a person is worse off today than he was yesterday, no logical explanation can satisfy him,"" he says. The document is far less specific on foreign-policy matters, with Ter-Petrossian saying only that he would strengthen Armenia's relations with Russia, Georgia and Iran and promising ""constructive efforts"" to normalize ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey. On the Karabakh conflict, the manifesto says Ter-Petrossian would display the ""political will"" to achieve a compromise peace deal with Azerbaijan that would enable the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to exercise their ""right to self-determination."" It does not specify Ter-Petrossian's position on international mediators' existing peace proposals.",,,

Authorities in host country Azerbaijan say the gathering is intended to strengthen ties between Turkey and five Turkic-speaking countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Summits bringing together the six countries have been held since 1992. The congress, hosted by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, is due to draw more than 500 other delegates from some 30 regions and countries -- including Mongolia, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia and Kosovo. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel are also due to attend. A general agreement on further cooperation will likely be signed at the end of the summit on November 19. Without giving details, Azerbaijani officials say the summit will also discuss the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian-speaking enclave in Azerbaijan that unilaterally declared itself an independent republic in 1991. The discussions will also address the divided island of Cyprus and the status of Turkic-speaking minorities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The issue of repatriation for Ahiska Turks will also be discussed at the Baku summit. Ahiska Turks -- who say that Georgia is their homeland -- were exiled by Soviet leaders during World War II to Central Asia, Russia, and Ukraine. Strengthening Ties With Turkey Vafa Quluzade, the president of the Baku think tank Political Studies for the Caspian Region, told RFE/RL that despite their broad and ambitious agendas, most of the Turkish-speaking nations' summits have never been able to implement their agreements and declarations, and that they were nothing more than ""speeches, declarations, and applause."" Quluzade said, however, that Turkic-speaking countries can use such meetings to build closer relationships with Turkey, which shares ""the same culture and almost the same language."" Quluzade said Turkey is the only truly democratic country among the Turkic nations, and that could serve as a good example to the others. ""Now there is a great importance in establishing good relations with Turkey because Turkey's much [further ahead] than the former Soviet republics on issues like democracy, on issues like Western orientation, and the economy,"" Quluzade said. He added that Turkey offers a positive model for the Turkic-speaking countries in the CIS. Quluzade said Turkey could also play an important role as an alternative transit route for the energy-rich countries in Central Asia, making them less dependent on Russia. However, Quluzade pointed out that the former Soviet republics do not need Turkey as a new ""big brother"" to replace Russia. In the 1990s, Turkish leaders as well as some of the Central Asian countries suggested creating a commonwealth or union of Turkic states. Quluzade said the idea of equal cooperation and partnership between Turkey and the other Turkic-speaking countries would be a more realistic goal.

But the findings and goals laid out by the Caucasus-Caspian Commission, meeting in London, are likely to be overshadowed by the recent political upheaval in Georgia. Although Georgia has until recently shown a clearer sense of purpose than most of its neighbors in its pursuit of EU membership, it now seems to risk backsliding into instability. The events there come as a timely reminder for the European Union, if one was needed, that leaving the Caucasus region and its Caspian hinterlands to their own devices is not a wise move.The report promises insights, in the words of its authors, into possibilities of ""upgrading"" the region's relations with the EU.Yet the EU has long made clear that it does not wish to move beyond the cooperation offered under the aegis of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP). And EU officials readily admit that the ENP does not give the EU enough leverage to influence basic policy choices in the most enthusiastic country in the region, Georgia. Offering Georgia prospects for EU membership would give the bloc greater influence -- but that has no backing among most EU member states.Little Engagement In Georgian UpheavalAlthough the EU has criticized the state of emergency declared last week by President Mikheil Saakashvili, it has done so in deliberately distant tones. Its statements have been no different in content or ambition than those normally issued about events in Latin America, South Asia, or elsewhere.Some in Brussels believe that what triggered the Georgian crackdown on the opposition was the realization that the country's bid to start on the path toward NATO membership will be rebuffed by the alliance at its next summit, in Bucharest in April 2008. Without prospects of further rapprochement with the EU, progress toward NATO membership remained the only major deliverable, and Tbilisi may simply be trying to mitigate an inevitable domestic backlash, or so goes the thinking in Brussels.The limitations the EU has put on its own policy options in the region can only hamstring the work of bodies like the Caucasus-Caspian Commission. Its chairman, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, said in an interview published on the commission's website in June that the report will be ""complementary"" to the efforts already being made by the EU. In other words, the report will not offer seismic revelations, but is instead likely to limit itself to building on existing policy.Rupel traces the familiar outlines of the conundrum facing the EU in the region. Its location and energy reserves make it important for the EU, and the EU recognizes that only external pressure can thaw the ""frozen conflicts"" continually destabilizing the region, but the bloc is in no position to dramatically increase its involvement.A preview of the main recommendations of the Caucasian-Caspian Committee's report on its website notes that ""it is critical for the region to diversify and better balance both politically and economically its relationships with both regional and global players -- such as Russia, China, Europe, India, Iran, and the [United States].""In the absence of prospects of integration with either the EU or NATO, the countries in the region must fall back on what they have -- and the key asset shared by most countries there is energy resources, or strategic locations in terms of their transit. Tellingly, the Central Asian countries have already adopted the very posture advocated by the report. They will try to keep friendly relations with all neighbors and sell their gas and oil to the highest bidder. Azerbaijan is taking a similar course, although less enthusiastically, because its resources will run out sooner than those of its Caspian neighbors.That leaves Armenia and Georgia. Armenia has already been removed from the energy game, and must make the best of a very difficult situation. Georgia will remain important to the EU as a transit country, and Brussels will doubtless continue to seek accommodation in this respect with whomever may be in power in Tbilisi.Looking ahead, Slovenian Foreign Minister Rupel -- whose country will take over the EU's rotating presidency in the first half of 2008 -- proffered a sobering assessment of the report's likely impact. ""If we can make a positive impact, fine; our endeavor will be well worth it. If not, we will each go back to our day jobs and try to do the best we can from there,"" he said.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079035.html,Armenia Azerbaijani Politicians Mull Implications Of TerPetrossian Comeback ,"October 26, 2007 15:27 GMT",,,"Levon Ter-Petrossian -- preparing for a comeback? (file photo) (ITAR-TASS) October 26, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- The possibility that Levon Ter-Petrossian, who served as Armenian president from the fall of 1991 until his forced resignation in February 1998, may announce his candidacy for the Armenian presidential ballot due in early 2008 has not only sent waves of shock and alarm through the incumbent Armenian leadership. It has also triggered speculation in Azerbaijan that the United States may back a presidential bid by Ter-Petrossian in the hope that he would adopt an unequivocally pro-Western position and help to undercut Russia's influence in the South Caucasus. Asked to comment on the possibility that Washington may seek to return Ter-Petrossian to power by means of a new ""colored revolution"" such as catapulted Viktor Yushchenko into the presidency of Ukraine, analyst Rauf Radjabov told day.az on October 24 that Washington would have to secure, first, the agreement of Ter-Petrossian -- who won a convincing and overwhelming victory in the 1991 presidential ballot -- to return to power by means of a revolution, and then to the complicity of Armenia's security services, which are currently under the firm control of Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian. Incumbent President Robert Kocharian has already identified Sarkisian as his preferred successor, and few doubt that he will be elected. The Armenian Constitution bars Kocharian from seeking a third consecutive presidential term. The 'Karabakh Clan'Radjabov suggested that what he branded the ""Karabakh clan"" is determined to cling to power, and would only admit defeat if given cast-iron guarantees of immunity from prosecution and that its members would not be stripped of the fortunes they amassed while in office. Moreover, Radjabov noted, Russia would be unlikely to condone any move by Washington that would call into question the future of its military base in Armenia. Radjabov did highlight one perceived dangerous consequence for Azerbaijan in the event that Washington does manage to engineer Ter-Petrossian's return to power, namely that the United States might exert pressure on Baku to accept a solution to the Karabakh conflict that is damaging to its interests. Asim Molla-zade, who heads the Party for Democratic Reforms, similarly stressed that it is unlikely that the ""Karabakh clan"" would voluntarily cede power. He went on to argue that it is to Azerbaijan's advantage that they should not do so, given the favorable comparison between the present Azerbaijani leadership and a clan that he described as accustomed to resorting to ""terror, bestial murders, and the harsh suppression of dissent"" to retain power. (Eldaniz Quliyev of the Movement of Intelligentsia of Azerbaijan similarly reasoned on October 3 that Ter-Petrossian's chances of being elected president are ""minimal,"" and that it would be to Azerbaijan's advantage if Sarkisian, whom Quliyev described as ""leading Armenia toward the precipice at a Stakhanovite pace,"" were to succeed Kocharian. Quliyev also dismissed the argument that Ter-Petrossian might adopt a more conciliatory stance on resolving the Karabakh conflict than Sarkisian.) At the same time, Molla-zade cautioned against speculation about a possible colored revolution, noting that Ter-Petrossian has still not formally announced his intention of running for president, and it remains unclear how much popular support he enjoys. Molla-zade also questioned the perception that Ter-Petrossian is pro-U.S., recalling the close military and economic ties with Russia cemented while Ter-Petrossian was president. To date, the only Azerbaijani official to have commented on the possibility of a colored revolution in Armenia is Foreign Ministry spokesman Xazar Ibragim. In an October 24 interview with day.az, Ibragim noted that any discussion of such a revolution only serves to highlight the weakness of the Armenian state and its leaders' inability to implement an independent policy. That weakness, he continued, is the fault of the incumbent leadership, and can be overcome only by a shift in foreign policy, liberating the districts of Azerbaijan currently occupied by Armenian forces, and seeking peaceful coexistence with all the states of the region. Ibragim further cautioned against focusing on specific political figures, including Ter-Petrossian, reasoning that ""for Armenia, much depends not on who is elected president but on what position he adopts with regard to foreign policy."" But he did not rule out the ""hypothetical possibility"" that a pro-U.S. politician could come to power in Armenia, resulting in ""a certain degree of support"" for Armenia in resolving the Karabakh conflict. Ibragim warned, however, that unlike Armenia, Azerbaijan is ""immune"" to any such pressure from world powers.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1079015.html,Taking Your Country To Court ,"October 24, 2007 15:00 GMT",,,"October 24, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- The story is a familiar one in the postcommunist world. Moldovan journalist Petru Poiata wrote two articles in 2002 that implicated a Communist parliament deputy of influence-peddling in the public transport business. A Moldovan court then ordered Poiata to pay a fine and apologize for his articles. Despite Poiata's protest that his allegations were backed up by statements from bus drivers and the managers of a bus company, Moldovan courts rejected his appeals against the defamation verdict. But on October 16, Poiata received the redress that he sought. The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Poiata and awarded him and the newspaper 4,570 euros ($6,495). Poiata is one of tens of thousands of people from the Council of Europe's 47 countries that lodge complaints with the European Court of Human Rights. ""It was more difficult for me to get a 'no' from Azerbaijani courts than a 'yes' from the European Court of Human Rights."" -- Sheyda Nasibova They seek redress against their governments for a wide range of offenses, from police abuse to nonpayment of pensions to press freedom violations and failure to fulfill court judgments. A rising share of these applications come from countries that joined the Council of Europe in the 1990s following the Soviet collapse, and where justice is often still shaky. Last year, the court received 112 cases from Georgia, 641 from Moldova, and 4,146 from Ukraine. The judgment, Poiata says, is a victory for all Moldovan journalists amid a tightening media clampdown. ""These days I work for the 'Flux' newspaper, and almost every day I hear this or that colleague has been sued for doing nothing more than quoting other people's opinions. All we journalists do is give people a chance to use their right to express their opinions,"" he says. Freedom Of Speech And Assembly One of the latest plaintiffs to win a case at the European Court of Human Rights is Sheyda Nasibova, an Azerbaijani citizen who heads a press freedom organization called Journalist Inquiry Center. She filed an application to the court after Azerbaijan's Justice Ministry refused to grant her group state registration. Nasibova turned to the Strasbourg-based court after a protracted and fruitless legal battle in her own country. ""It was more difficult for me to get a 'no' from Azerbaijani courts than a 'yes' from the European Court of Human Rights,"" she told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service. ""Cases drag on forever in Azerbaijani courts. In the end, I was able to appeal to the European Court."" The European Court of Human Rights on October 18 unanimously ruled that Azerbaijani authorities had violated Nasibova's right to a fair trial and to freedom of association. The court ordered the government to award her $4,260 in damages. But like most plaintiffs, Nasibova says money matters less than moral reparation. The European Court is also taking on an increasing number of complaints from Armenia. This year, it passed its first-ever ruling against the Armenian government, condemning it for arresting opposition politician Armen Mkrtchyan during a street protest. One of the pending cases was filed by Armenia's A1 Plus television channel, which was pulled off the air in April 2002 after losing its broadcasting frequency in a tender organized by a president-appointed body. A1 Plus says it has filed a dozen applications for a new broadcasting license to the National Commission on Television and Radio. All have been rejected. ""We complained about two violations -- one concerning human rights, the other freedom of speech,"" says Mesrop Movsisian, the owner of the company that founded A1 Plus. ""Now we are waiting for the court's decision. We are very eager to be back on the air, because we feel there's an information vacuum."" The Council of Europe and international rights groups have criticized Armenian authorities for closing the channel. This year saw a raft of Strasbourg court rulings holding Russia responsible for atrocities committed by federal troops in Chechnya. Setting A Precedent One of the Chechen plaintiffs to recently win a case was Marzet Imakayeva, a woman whose 25-year-old son and husband disappeared after being detained by Russian forces in 2000 and 2002 respectively. ""I thought that applying to the Strasbourg court could help me find my son,"" she told RFE/RL's North Caucasus Service. ""I thought that maybe he would be given back to me in order to avoid a court case. I told them that no money in the world would compensate for my son, that I would lodge an application in the hope that they return him to avoid a precedent. That's how I prepared the documents and sent them to the court."" Imakayeva said an official came to her home and threatened her with dire consequences if she didn't withdraw her complaint. The court ordered Russia to pay $128,000 to Imakayeva, who has since emigrated to the United States. Both her son and husband are still missing and are feared dead. In July, the court held Russia responsible for the death of 11 civilians killed in the Grozny suburb of Novye Aldy during a Russian military operation in 2000. The raid killed at least 60 people. The court awarded damages to relatives of two other civilians killed by Russian forces the same year in the Chechen village of Gekhi. In total, Russia was ordered to pay more than $350,000 in compensation.

On the agenda is a natural-gas pipeline between the two countries and other energy issues. Federico Bordonaro, a Rome-based senior analyst with the Power and Interest News Report, spoke to RFE/RL about the geopolitical implications of the growing ties between Armenia and Iran. RFE/RL: Given the problems between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Shi'ite like Iran, why is Iran so eager to forge good ties with Armenia? Federico Bordonaro: Contrary to the expectations of those who follow the theories of Samuel Huntington [the author of ""The Clash of Civilizations""] we can see in this case that it is not really civilizations that drive alliances or strategic partnerships, but sheer geopolitical arrangements. Iran does not want a very strong Azerbaijan -- first of all, because Azerbaijan is pro-United States, and second, because the Azeri minority in Iran must be checked by the Tehran central government. RFE/RL: Ahmadinejad's visit comes shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to Tehran. Moscow also has its own interests in Armenia. Is a three-way partnership developing here? Bordonaro: Russia finds in Armenia and Iran a kind of axis that projects Russian influence in the [Persian] Gulf. And of course, Russia has the same problem with Azerbaijan. The problem is that Azerbaijan is becoming too pro-NATO and pro-Western for Moscow. RFE/RL: So this is part of the larger geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West for influence in the region? Bordonaro: A Russian-Armenian-Iranian strategic partnership in terms of energy security, energy projects, and intelligence sharing is very profitable for Russia if Russia is to check the U.S. and NATO penetration in the South Caucasus. I think that the alignment that we are seeing today is dictated mainly by energy routes and by the fact that Russia and Iran find it interesting to put yet another irritant in the geo-strategy of the West. But I think it is more tactical and could be reversed. RFE/RL: Why would it be reversed? Bordonaro: Russia for the moment sees Iran as more of a cooperator than a competitor in Armenia. But I would say in the medium to long term, Iran is a competitor to Russia in the Caspian region. So I would not be surprised to see a reversal. I would not be surprised [if] Russia drops Iran once Russia, for example, has succeeded in negotiating something with the United States in Eastern Europe or the South Caucasus. RFE/RL: Armenia's position here is also quite interesting since they have good relations with the United States and the West. Can you comment on that? Bordonaro: Armenia is very interesting because it does not reason in terms of bloc against bloc. Armenia is also pro-Western, we should not forget this. There are many reasons. There are cultural reasons. There are successful Armenian diasporas in the United States and France, for example. Armenia is sympathetic to the European Union. But at the same time, Armenia is not scared by Russia and Iran in the same way that the West is. So it is a very complex and interesting situation. RFE/RL: How does Armenia's geographic situation explain Yerevan's readiness to work so closely with Moscow and Tehran? Bordonaro: It is a landlocked country. When you are landlocked, you need access to the sea via [another country]. This is a powerful drive in the foreign policies of landlocked countries. And Armenia has no strategic resources. It is very dependent upon Russia and Iran. This is why Armenia cannot afford to make as dramatic a pro-Western turn as Georgia or Azerbaijan.",,,

The nonbinding resolution, narrowly approved last week by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has threatened to damage Washington's already-frayed relations with Turkey.In response to the committee's vote, Turkey recalled its envoy to Washington and threatened to cut military cooperation with the United States, which uses an air base in Turkey as a resupply hub for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.U.S. President George W. Bush, the State Department, and an array of former senior U.S. diplomats strongly oppose the measure. Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, who begins an official visit to Washington today, will have a chance to hear the administration's view on the issue when he meets with Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The resolution had appeared to have the necessary backing from Democrats to win passage in the full House of Representatives. But on October 17, a group of prominent Democrats suddenly withdrew their support. Waning Democratic SupportThey urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Democrat, California) not to go ahead with her plan to bring the measure to a full House vote. The group included Florida Representative Bob Wexler, who said the issue is not about Turkey or Armenia, but about the United States. Congress, he said, has a responsibility to act in the best interest of its soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that means protecting U.S.-Turkish relations.""What we are asking is our own leadership to do what is right for the American, national, and strategic interest,"" Wexler told a news conference. ""This is an extremely difficult issue. All of us feel extraordinary sympathy with the plight and the catastrophic death that the Armenian community suffered in the World War I period. But our responsibility, the bottom line, is to do what is right for our national security, well being of our troops.""Also withdrawing his support for the resolution was Pennsylvania Representative John Murtha, a leading opponent of the Iraq war. Murtha said the United States needs all the help it can get in the Middle East and should not be risking the support of a key ally. ""You take Iraq, we've got a coalition of the willing -- there's nobody left,"" Murtha said. ""We need every ally we can get. They're important to our effort in Iraq. We've got 160,000 troops in Iraq. This is important to the U.S. effort in Iraq, period."" Turkey denies that a systematic slaughter of Armenians took place, saying Armenians and Turks alike were killed in the clashes after Armenian groups sided with Russia in World War I. Relations With Turkey 'Critical'Bush, speaking at a news conference in Washington on October 17, reiterated his opposition to the resolution, warning that the measure would deal a blow to U.S. military interests in the region. ""One thing Congress should not be doing is sorting out the historical record of the Ottoman Empire,"" he said. The resolution on the mass killings of Armenians beginning in 1915 is counterproductive. Both Republicans and Democrats, including every living former secretary of state, have spoken out against this resolution. Congress has more important work to do than antagonizing a democratic ally in the Muslim world, especially one that's providing vital support for our military every day.""The Democrats who withdrew their support said they did so to preserve good U.S. relations with Turkey at a critical time. But even as they spoke, Turkey's parliament was voting to give its government military authority to enter northern Iraq to do battle with several thousand Kurdish guerrillas based there -- a move Washington opposes.Norman Ornstein, a foreign-policy scholar at Washington's American Enterprise Institute, says the U.S. government is right to be concerned about potential fallout from the resolution. Ornstein adds that he believes the resolution will be withdrawn because the potential margin of victory is so small, and because the damage caused by a vote would outweigh any benefits that might be achieved. He said a one- or two-vote margin of victory wouldn't even please the Armenian-American constituency, which has lobbied so hard for it.""The fact is, we've got soldiers in Iraq who could be put in more jeopardy if Turkey decided to withdraw some of the cooperation they give to us,"" Ornstein said. ""And this issue is clearly one of such enormous, intense, emotional interest to the Turkish government and to people in Turkey that you can imagine a kind of response from their government that would be injurious to us in the short run. And I think it's that fear that really motivated the people in Congress who were going to vote for this, to think twice.""",,,

Speaking in Moscow on October 13, Rice appealed for restraint against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. Ambassador Recalled Rice also called for restraint in Turkey's response to a vote by a U.S. congressional panel describing the massacre of Armenians during World War I as genocide. Washington has warned that any such incursion would further destabilize the situation in Iraq. Turkey has recalled its U.S. ambassador for consultations after the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives voted on October 10 to approve the nonbinding resolution. The move came as the Turkish government is expected next week to formally seek parliament approval for an operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants in northern Iraq. Seeking Cooperation In a telephone interview with RFE/RL's Afghan Service on October 12, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad said cooperation is key to resolving the issue. ""There has to be a solution to the presence of terrorists elements, including the PKK, in those areas [in northern Iraq],"" he said. ""The best way to deal with this is through cooperation with the Iraqi [central authorities], and the regional authorities in the Kurdish region of Iraq, and with Turkey."" On the controversial congressional resolution, Khalilzad said the U.S.-Turkey strategic alliance should not be undermined at any price. ""I hope that we deal with this issue -- and the [U.S.] administration has clearly taken a position against the passage of the resolution that is being debated in Congress -- that Turkey and the United States can sustain the strategic alliance, close cooperation, and the kind of closeness that has served both countries quite well in the Cold War and during the period after the end of the Cold War,"" he said.

GUAM, which groups Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, is just one of the myriad alliances that arose from the ashes of the Soviet Union and are now vying for control of the region. The GUAM youth summit comes just days after a gathering in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, of officials from the 12 former Soviet republics that form the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS. The CIS summit featured sideline meetings between additional regional groupings. The six-member Eurasian Economic Community, or Eurasec, held talks. The Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, signed an important agreement to pool resources. Alphabet Soup The dizzying assortment of regional alliances -- together with their perplexing acronyms -- is one of the legacies of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some of these groupings, like the CIS, followed in the immediate wake of the USSR; others in the late 1990s. Some are concerned with security and defense, while others focus mainly on economic development. Only close observers are likely able to recite the membership and official aims of all of the groups. But Alexandre Rondeli, the head of the Georgian Foundation for Strategy and International Studies in Tbilisi, makes it simple. All of these organizations, he says, can be roughly split into two camps. ""Any alliance or organization that doesn't include Russia or that isn't dominated by Russia is considered an enemy, hostile [by Moscow]."" -- analyst Alexandre Rondeli ""Some countries try to defend themselves and form alliances to counter Russian threats and even Russian economic pressure,"" Rondeli says. ""Other alliances and groups are created by Russia, or Russia's close allies, to restore a post-imperial space under Russian domination."" Under that model, GUAM -- which stands for the name of its four members, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova -- would fall into the first category. Although its leaders insist the group is not directed against any other state, the westward-leaning ambitions evident in varying degrees in its members have contributed to its reputation as an anti-Moscow alliance. Lately, GUAM has focused on extending an oil pipeline from Brody in Ukraine to the Polish city of Gdansk, which would enable Azerbaijan to pump oil directly to Western Europe, bypassing Russia. The leaders of Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, and Lithuania are expected to discuss the project today at an energy summit in the Lithuanian Baltic Sea town of Klaipeda. Also high on GUAM's agenda are plans to create a multinational peacekeeping force that would replace the Russian contingent currently deployed in the Moscow-backed separatist regions of Transdniester in Moldova, and of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia. 'Anti-Russian' Expectedly, Russian officials have consistently accused the alliance of being anti-Russian and denounced it as an instrument used by the United States, a GUAM sponsor, and other Western nations to try to undermine Russia's clout in the region. ""The geopolitical context of this organization is definitely anti-Russian,"" says Konstantin Zatulin, the head of the CIS Institute in Moscow and a State Duma deputy for the country's Unified Russia ruling party. ""Some are making use of the unfulfilled ambitions or internal problems of certain countries which, for a number of reasons, do not or cannot work with Russia like others. The West needs this organization to compensate for Russia's influence and revival, to contain it."" Others, like Rondeli in Tbilisi, say Moscow is simply riled by the efforts of GUAM member states to break out of Moscow's orbit. ""Russia has always seen GUAM as a menace,"" Rondeli says. ""Any alliance or organization that doesn't include Russia or that isn't dominated by Russia is considered an enemy, hostile. [Russia] is trying to destroy it by influencing certain countries, for example [former GUAM member] Uzbekistan and Moldova."" The pro-Western presidents of Ukraine and Georgia, Viktor Yushchenko and Mikheil Saakashvili, both swept to power after mass protests that toppled Moscow-friendly regimes. Both are at loggerheads with the Kremlin. While Moldova also leans increasingly westward, Azerbaijan has retained a more conciliatory position, avoiding confrontation with Moscow. All four heads of state have called for increased cooperation between GUAM and NATO and the European Union. Yushchenko's rise to the presidency has also poured cold water on Moscow's hopes of creating a common economic space comprising Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week during the Dushanbe CIS summit that Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan will launch a customs union in 2011 within the framework of Eurasec. He said the union may later grow to embrace the three other Eurasec members -- Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Three of the four GUAM members -- Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova -- have meanwhile threatened to desert the CIS altogether. Many Commonwealth member states have aired frustration with what is seen as Moscow's domineering role in the group. A number of policy watchers have seen the deepening rifts within the CIS as signs heralding its disintegration. But Alexander Rahr, a CIS expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, says shifting alliances are only natural in the context of transition. The SCO groups Russia and China with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (official site) ""One thing has changed. In the 1990s, post-Soviet countries were poor; they were dependent on the West or on Asia for resources. Today, the situation has dramatically changed,"" Rahr says. ""These countries have reached unexpectedly high levels of economic growth, so they will develop their own interests in each other, their own way of building the future together."" Rahr nonetheless upholds the view that shifts within the CIS are crystallizing into two camps, with GUAM countries increasingly setting their sights on the West. The result, he says, is that Russia is rallying allies in the East. ""Russia has understood that it has no future building a new reintegration model with countries like Ukraine or Georgia, which are heading westward,"" he says. ""So Moscow is moving toward the east, toward the Central Asian states, which are eager to have some kind of alliance with Russia. I think the idea of a gas cartel that would include this region's energy-rich countries is something that Moscow is envisaging for itself in the near future."" Still, there are other regional groupings that bring Moscow and some of its dissenters to the table. The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group, or BSEC, brings together 12 countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine, with the expressed aim of fostering stability and integration in the Black Sea region. There is also the informal grouping of the Caspian Sea littoral states, which comprises Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. Tehran is due to host the next Caspian Sea summit on October 16.",,,

Addressing the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in Brussels, Oskanian admitted that there are ""outstanding issues"" in the countries' relations, but said that none should stand in the way of dialogue. Armenia and Turkey continue to disagree over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed ethnic-Armenian region in Azerbaijan, and are clearly at odds over the interpretation of the mass killings of Armenians that took place in Ottoman Turkey between 1915-18. Oskanian's comments mirror those he made last week in New York, where he attended the 62nd session of UN General Assembly and met with his Turkish counterpart, Ali Babacan. They also come as a U.S. Congressional committee prepares to consider on October 10 a draft resolution that would define the World War I-era killings as genocide. Oskanian appealed to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee to put more pressure on Turkey to open a dialogue with Armenia. He said land-locked Armenia is particularly keen to see Turkey lift the border blockade it imposed against Armenia in the early 1990s. ""The border opening is not only important for Armenia, but it's also important for the European Union, because Turkey is the natural bridge between the Caucasus and Europe, and the European Union,"" Oskanian said. ""Without Turkey's equitable and even-handed policy vis-a-vis our region, our relationship is not as effective as it could have been under conditions of normal ties between Turkey and Armenia."" An Urgent Issue Oskanian's call was met with some sympathy among the European deputies in attendance. The chairwoman of the European Parliament's delegation for the South Caucasus, Marie Anne Isler-Beguin, said the bloc was not putting enough pressure on Turkey during EU-accession talks. Isler-Beguin said opening the border would greatly benefit both sides. An impact study on the effects of the border closure on both Armenia and Turkey found that it is ""really urgent to open the border for the good of the populations on both sides,"" she said. The European Parliament is scheduled to hold a hearing on the issue in early November, during which the study will be made public. Oskanian criticized the EU for its ""neutrality"" on the issue, an attitude he said was understandable, but misplaced. He claimed that while Armenia has no preconditions to pursue closer links between the two countries, Turkey does. He dismissed Ankara's concern that Armenia harbors territorial claims against it, saying the border between the two countries is ""clearly marked"" and conforms to the boundary set out in a 1922 treaty between Turkey and the Soviet Union. Oskanian also said Armenia's conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic-Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh does not involve Turkey and should not be raised by Ankara in a bilateral context. He also rejected a call by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to set up a commission to study the events of 1915-18. He said talks on the issue remain impossible as long as Turkey's penal code continues to criminalize any depiction of the mass killings as ""genocide."" Oskanian also said dialogue was impossible as long as the border between the two countries is closed. Balancing Between East And West Armenia's difficulties with Turkey undermine much of the country's policy of ""complementarity,"" its balancing act in relation to its neighbors and global players with an interest in the region. Oskanian explained the policy as a refusal to ""choose between East and West"" in other countries' disputes and conflicts, and to remain ""considerate"" to everyone's interests. ""For countries like Armenia there is no reason to choose between one [side] and another. We will benefit from all the opportunities that are available from all sides in security terms, energy terms, economic, and otherwise, so that we augment the end product as much as we can,"" Oskanian said. Oskanian defended Armenia's heavy reliance on Russia in security and energy issues, saying both were necessitated by blockades imposed by neighbors. He also described as ""absolutely inappropriate"" Azerbaijan's attempts to discuss Nagorno-Karabakh at the United Nations. He said Armenia believes the OSCE Minsk Group remains the only appropriate venue for talks on the frozen conflict. Oskanian said the OSCE talks have revealed ""serious prospects of resolution,"" noting that only four issues remain from a three-page document addressing the ""basic principles"" of resolving the conflict. Oskanian said that so far the two countries' leaders have been unable to come to a consensus on the four issues, but expressed hope that the differences could be overcome before Armenia's presidential elections in February 2008.",,,

A coordinated migration policy and improved economic cooperation topped the agenda. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev -- whose country holds the rotating CIS presidency -- said the leaders of the member countries have agreed to coordinate labor migration in the region, as well as the legal and social protection of the migrants. Seventeen documents were signed during the meeting, including agreements on the creation of a free-trade zone and a coordinated customs system. The summit also approved Russian Sergei Lebedev as the new CIS executive secretary, replacing countryman Vladimir Rushailo. Criticized As Ineffective The CIS was initially formed by Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The loose alliance is often criticized as an ineffective talking shop. It now brings together 12 former Soviet republics. It has been strained by disputes between Russia and other member states, including Ukraine and Georgia over Russian gas prices. Some Central Asian countries have sought closer ties with the United States and China, while Georgia and Ukraine have expressed a desire to enter the European Union and NATO. Russia has sought to maintain its influence in the former Soviet countries through other, smaller regional alliances, including the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). The CSTO brings together Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia. Linking With SCO Shortly before the summit of the heads of the CIS member states, the CSTO signed an agreement to link with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a China-led regional security body. Nikolai Bordyuzha, the CSTO general-secretary, said confrontation with NATO is not in his group's plans. ""We don't see NATO as a rival, and certainly not as an enemy,"" he said. ""As you know, we have offered our cooperation to NATO in many areas, including [combating] illegal drug trafficking. So I think it is a mistake to say that the document we signed today on systematic cooperation between the CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is an attempt to rival or counteract NATO."" Although the membership of the two regional groups overlaps to some degree, the move is seen as a sign of Russian and Chinese determination to strengthen security links with each other and energy-rich Central Asia.

""So Kazakhstan has the following stance on the issue: the liberalization of legal labor migration -- which means those migrants who get official registration in a timely and well-defined manner -- and a tough stance against illegal migration.""

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1078864.html,CIS Real Action At Summit Likely To Be On Sidelines ,"October 04, 2007 13:44 GMT",,,"Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) wants to use the CIS summit to discuss natural gas with Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov (file photo) (AFP) October 4, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Migration policy, counterterrorism, and military cooperation will all be on the official agenda when the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) holds its summit on October 5-6 in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. But the real action will be on the sidelines. In a statement released last week, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that in addition to the 20 items on the agenda, CIS officials will also discuss a proposal to reform the organization. But analysts say they do not expect any consequential decisions to come out of the summit. This is because the CIS has become an increasingly less cohesive organization in the 15 years since it emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union. ""I think the main action will be in bilateral meetings,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the journal ""Russia In Global Affairs."" ""This is connected to the fact that the CIS's general function has changed. It is no longer a format to make decisions, but rather a platform to conduct negotiations."" Energy Likely To Dominate Ghodratollah Shahidi, director of RFE/RL's Tajik Service, is in Dushanbe covering the summit. Shahidi explains that one of the key items on the informal agenda will be energy, as is often the case when Russia meets with its former Soviet neighbors. ""Russia has been pushing very hard to sign bilateral contracts and agreements with several countries in the region,"" Shahidi says. In what analysts describe as a key meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to get together with Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov to discuss the transport of natural gas. Russia has controlled Turkmen natural-gas exports since the Soviet breakup because the only pipelines exporting gas out of the country -- other than a small pipeline to Iran -- pass through Russia. ""Turkmenistan has strongly signaled to the West that it is interested in different [gas] routes. For Russia, this is a question of principle. If the European Union and the United States manage to break up Gazprom's monopoly on the Eurasian territory, then everything changes."" -- Fyodor Lukyanov, ""Russia in Global Affairs"" In May, Putin, Berdymukhammedov, and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev agreed to build a pipeline along the Caspian Sea coast to transport natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe via Kazakhstan and Russia. But the United States has been pressing Berdymukhammedov to participate in a project to build pipelines under the Caspian Sea that would bypass Russia and deliver Turkmen gas to Europe via Turkey. Breaking Gazprom's Monopoly? Berdymukhammedov has expressed an interest in joining these projects. Such a move would diminish Moscow's dominance of the region's energy markets -- and its geopolitical influence, Lukyanov says. ""Turkmenistan has strongly signaled to the West that it is interested in different [gas] routes,"" he says. ""For Russia, this is a question of principle. If the European Union and the United States manage to break up Gazprom's monopoly on the Eurasian territory, then everything changes."" Berdymukhammedov was in the United States in September and is due to meet EU officials in Brussels this month. Lukyanov adds that Putin is keen to get Turkmenistan's confirmation of the project Berdymukhammedov agreed to in May and keep the country in Moscow's sphere of influence. ""The Turkmen president has demonstrated that he is not in Putin's pocket. He was just in America. He is going to Brussels in October. This game around Turkmenistan will continue and unfold,"" Lukyanov says. Another issue looming over the CIS summit is who will be the organization's new executive secretary. In June, Moscow floated the name of Aleksandr Veshnyakov, the former head of the Russian Central Election Commission. But in a clear snub to Moscow, Belarus made it clear that it would not support him, and Russia withdrew his name from consideration. The outgoing executive secretary, Vladimir Rushailo, whose term ended on June 14, is still the acting CIS head. Lukyanov said it is unclear whether Rushailo will stay in office, or whether Russia will try to submit Veshnyakov's name again. ""At the last summit, Belarus refused to support Veshnyakov and that was all. Rushailo is the acting executive secretary until now even though his term ended long ago,"" he says. ""It will be interesting to see if there will be some kind of agreement or if Russia puts forward another candidate."" Breaking Free Of Moscow Russia's difficulties with Belarus over the CIS executive secretary and with Turkmenistan over gas are indicative of a larger trend in the organization as more and more former Soviet states seek to break free of Moscow's sphere of influence. ""There are several members of the CIS who are now more favorable to the West than to Russia,"" says Shahidi. ""And this has created problems, as before, that they cannot reach agreement on some major issues."" The CIS comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Turkmenistan is an associate member. Georgia has made joining NATO and the European Union a cornerstone of its policy. Azerbaijan is seeking closer ties with the United States and Europe.

Summing up the collective woes of the three countries in the region, Semneby said on October 2 that although Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan share history, they lack a common identity. Soviet attempts to impose unity failed, Semneby says, and now the three countries are each in the grip of ""old-fashioned, ethnically exclusive"" nationalism. Semneby said Europe could help remedy this situation. ""Given the rivalries between and inside the countries, this identity has to be larger than the region itself,"" he said. ""An additional layer of identity, a European identity, is what comes to mind here. For such an identity, or for such a layer of identity to work as a catalyst for bringing this broken region together again, the countries and the communities in the region need, however, to understand that this identity is based on much more than just interests, but is fundamentally based on common values."" Yet the EU envoy was equally candid in making it plain that the EU at this point has little new to offer. Georgia Both Ambitious, Vulnerable Semneby identified Georgia as the most advanced country in the region and the most ambitious in its drive to move closer to the EU and NATO. However, he also characterized Georgia as being the most vulnerable -- largely due to the impact outside players such as Russia can have on its domestic affairs. ""I would mention as a particular [regional] concern the rising tensions in Georgian-Russian relations, which is illustrated, for example, by the continuing Russian sanctions against Georgia and the increasing number of security incidents in and around the conflict zones in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,"" he said. ""Given the rivalries between and inside the countries [of the South Caucasus], this identity has to be larger than the region itself. An additional layer of identity, a European identity, is what comes to mind here."" -- Peter Semneby, EU special representative Semneby said there has been ""no progress"" in resolving the frozen conflicts in Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Upcoming elections in Russia, as well as talks on the future status of another frozen conflict, Kosovo, are contributing to what Semneby describes as ""nervousness"" in the region. He also poured cold water on Georgia's attempts to sideline the separatist government in South Ossetia by setting up a rival, pro-Tbilisi administration. Semneby said the EU will continue working with the de facto government in Tsinkhvali, as it is key to addressing ""the problem which needs to be resolved,"" though it does recognize that there are parallel authorities in the region. The Georgian government is also not likely to be pleased by Semneby's observations that the EU will not send peacekeepers to Georgia without the consent of all involved parties, or join the Georgian government's new Commission on the Staus of South Ossetia. He also failed to say when the EU might relax its visa requirements for Georgian citizens to match the concessions already made for Russia -- and enjoyed by the huge number of Russian passport holders in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Semneby listed a number of recent EU confidence-building measures in Georgia, but acknowledged that the bloc's involvement in what are mostly training and liaison missions constitutes a ""rather modest effort."" in the security sector. Nagorno-Karabakh Situation 'Fragile' Addressing Armenia and Azerbaijan, Semneby noted their continued dispute over the unrecognized republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the stalemate remains ""fragile"" and that the situation could deteriorate in the run-up to elections in each of the two countries in 2008. Semneby said the mediation efforts pursued by the OSCE Minsk Group in the region will intensify in the near future, adding that the EU will fully support them. As in Georgia, he said, the EU will focus on ""confidence-building measures,"" among which he identified the promotion of people-to-people contacts to help minimize the isolation of those living in the conflict zones. The EU special representative said little on Armenia aside from noting that the country's parliamentary elections in May were an improvement over previous polls. But he sounded a warning for Azerbaijan. Semneby said the EU's interest in Azerbaijan's energy resources and transit potential will not cause the bloc to turn a blind eye to its deteriorating rights standards. ""At the same time, we cannot close our eyes to other parts of the [EU] agenda -- the need to implement democratic reforms, to respect human rights, and freedom of the media, and so on,"" he said. ""I mentioned [earlier] some of the problems we had with Azerbaijan in this context. I think it's important that [everyone] realizes that if these issues are also not taken seriously in the relationship [with the EU], this relationship will sooner or later run into trouble, and the interest-based part of the relationship will also suffer as a result."" Once again revisiting the region's frozen conflicts, Semneby noted Russia's role in negotiations, saying Moscow will remain a ""key actor"" in efforts to resolve the disputes and noting the EU's ""common interest"" in seeing such a conclusion.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1078774.html,Armenia Former President Lambastes Criminal Regime ,"September 24, 2007 14:01 GMT",,,"Ter-Petrossian has been cagey on whether he will run for president next year (file) (epa) The speaker of the parliament responsible for Armenia's secession from the Soviet Union took advantage of the anniversary of that decision to harshly criticize the country's current leadership. RFE/RL's regional analyst comments on former parliament speaker and President Levon Ter-Petrossian's biting evaluation of his successor's administration. September 24, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Speaking in Yerevan on the 16th anniversary of Armenia's 1991 declaration of secession, Levon Ter-Petrossian singled out President Robert Kocharian, one of the key figures behind Ter-Petrossian's forced resignation as president in February 1998. In his first major address for nine years, Ter-Petrossian on September 21 accused Kocharian of presiding over a ""criminal regime"" that has turned Armenia into a ""third-world country"" and jeopardized all chance of achieving a settlement of the Karabakh conflict on terms acceptable to Armenia. At the same time, Ter-Petrossian said he has not yet decided whether to run in the presidential elections due in early 2008, in which Kocharian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. Denouncing the current leadership as ""an institutionalized mafia-style regime that has plunged us into the ranks of third-world counties,"" Ter-Petrossian argued that regime change is a fundamental national priority, given that ""survival of this government gives us no chance of ever getting out of this situation,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. But he conceded that ""the only way to get rid of these authorities is the consolidation of all sound political, public, intellectual, and spiritual forces around a single [presidential] candidate."" Single Opposition Candidate? Armenian opposition parties have for weeks been debating the possibility of aligning behind a single candidate to challenge Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, whom Kocharian was quoted as endorsing on September 14 as the only politician in Armenia with the necessary experience and professional qualities to succeed him. But until now, few observers have rated Ter-Petrossian's chances of being selected as that single opposition candidate very high. Moreover, Vazgen Manukian, the veteran oppositionist who served under Ter-Petrossian in the early 1990s first as prime minister and then as defense minister, told journalists in Yerevan on September 5 that even assuming Ter-Petrossian decides to run in 2008, which Manukian considered unlikely, he would not withdraw his own candidacy in favor of the former president. In the 1996 presidential election, several opposition candidates pulled out at the last minute to back Manukian against Ter-Petrossian, who was proclaimed the victor with 52 percent of the vote compared to 41 percent for Manukian. In an interview with state television two years later, one of Ter-Petrossian's chief henchmen, former Interior Minister Vano Siradeghian, admitted that the results of the 1996 presidential vote were rigged to preclude a second round runoff between Ter-Petrossian and Manukian. In addition, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), which is an associate member of the coalition government, has announced its firm intention of fielding its own presidential candidate in 2008 rather than backing Prime Minister Sarkisian, even though its recent congress in Nagorno-Karabakh failed to yield agreement on who that candidate should be -- parliament Deputy Speaker Vahan Hovannisian or parliament foreign-affairs committee Chairman Armen Rustamian. In the event of a second runoff between Sarkisian and Ter-Petrossian, however, the HHD would throw its weight behind Sarkisian. Aside from their ideological differences, the HHD has a personal score to settle with Ter-Petrossian, who in late December 1994 declared the party illegal and in July 1995 ordered the arrest of 31 of its activists, including both Hovannisian and Rustamian, on charges of terrorism and plotting to overthrow the country's leadership. Two years later, the Supreme Court sentenced Hovannisian to four and Rustamian to three years' imprisonment. One of Kocharian's first moves after becoming acting president in February 1998 was to relegalize the HHD and order the release from jail of Hovannisian, whom he subsequently named as one of his aides. Hovannisian on September 24 hit back at Ter-Petrossian, who he said has no moral right to criticize the Kocharian leadership, given that his eight-year tenure as president was marred by fraudulent elections, human-rights violations, and other abuses. He said the ""vicious phenomena"" that still persist in Armenia have their roots in the Ter-Petrossian era. Hovannisian said the HHD would welcome Ter-Petrossian's participation in next year's presidential ballot as it would add ""an ideological element"" to the race. But he predicted that Ter-Petrossian will ultimately decide against running as his chances of winning are minimal and ""he doesn't like losing."" Accusations Over Karabakh In his address on September 21, Ter-Petrossian described as the ""greatest crime"" committed by Kocharian and Sarkisian their failure to agree to a solution to the Karabakh conflict. In the fall of 1997, Ter-Petrossian published a seminal article entitled ""War And Peace: Time For Serious Thought,"" in which he argued that resolving the Karabakh conflict rather than preserving the status quo was in the interests of both Armenia and the unrecognized republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (NKR), in order to remove obstacles to economic development and unspecified ""problems"" in Armenia's relations with other countries; that the conflict should be resolved peacefully, rather than militarily; and that the eventual settlement should constitute a compromise in which neither side would emerge as either the winner or the loser. Ter-Petrossian stressed that ""compromise is not a choice between the good and the bad, but rather between the bad and the [even] worse."" And he went on to warn that ""The opposition should not mislead the people by arguing that there is an alternative to compromise; the alternative to compromise is war."" In ""War And Peace"" Ter-Petrossian also addressed anew the question of the relative merits of the so-called ""phased"" and ""package"" approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict, noting that since both Azerbaijan and the NKR leadership had rejected two successive draft peace plans proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group that were based on the ""package"" approach, it made sense for Armenia to accept as a basis for negotiation the subsequent (September 1997) Minsk Group ""phased"" blueprint, even though he considered its terms far from ideal. This is Kocharian's last term allowed under the constitution (AFP) It has long been accepted as ""conventional wisdom"" that Ter-Petrossian's endorsement of the September 1997 phased peace plan was the primary, if not the sole reason why several of his ministers, including Kocharian and Sarkisian -- then premier and interior minister, respectively -- launched the campaign that culminated in his forced resignation in February 1998. But as Ter-Petrossian's former adviser Gerard Libaridian points out in his book, ""The Challenges of Statehood,"" Ter-Petrossian had argued earlier in favor of a compromise solution to the conflict, and the ministers in question had not previously taken issue with that argument. Libaridian also affirmed that the disagreement between Ter-Petrossian and the triumvirate that sought to oust him did not center on the relative merits of the ""phased"" vs. the ""package"" approaches to resolving the conflict. Ter-Petrossian argued on September 21 that Azerbaijan is now less and less prepared to make concessions to the Armenian side because of its mounting oil revenues. ""From now on they will not agree to any concessions. I don't know what needs to be done to get out of this situation,"" he said. Ter-Petrossian embarked in early August on a series of meetings with supporters and HHSh sympathizers across Armenia, and the HHSh subsequently announced its intention of nominating him as its presidential candidate. But that party is widely perceived as compromised and enjoying only minimal support. The radical Hanrapetutiun (Republic) opposition party headed by former Prime Minister Aram Sargsian likewise backs Ter-Petrossian, as do a couple of small HHSh splinter groups, including Aylentrank (Alternative). An opinion poll conducted in July found that if presidential elections were held then, only some 1.7 percent of the 1,200 respondents would have voted for Ter-Petrossian. Presumably precisely because the degree of popular support he could count on remains unclear, Ter-Petrossian declined on September 21 to say whether he will in fact participate in the 2008 ballot. ""I have not made a decision yet.... I am still examining, weighing up, considering things. My approach is purely political. I can't be guided by emotions. Adventurism is alien to my character,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service quoted him as saying. (Emil Danielyan and Karine Kalantarian of RFE/RL's Armenian Service contributed to this analysis.)",,,

The attack on the 44-year-old editor of the opposition newspaper ""Iskakan iravunk"" (""True Law"") took place on September 15. Galadjian was hospitalized with injuries to his head and body. Speaking to local media after the incident, Galadjian described the attackers as ""two people with bodyguard looks."" He told local media that he received a telephone call from a young man who introduced himself as a reporter from another newspaper and asked for a meeting. Galadjian said he invited the man to his office and gave him his mobile phone number. In the evening, he said he received another call from the same person, who complained that he was unable to find the meeting place. Galadjian then offered to meet outside the building. Galadjian said that the attack took place when he was coming down the stairs to go to that meeting. The journalist said he was hit over the head and then two men hit him with batons before running away. Galadjian's newspaper, ""Iskakan iravunk,"" is a spin off of the ""Iravunk"" newspaper, which was owned and published by the opposition Union of Constitutional Rights (SIM). During the last year, the SIM has been in turmoil following a leadership dispute. In September 2006, the editor in chief of ""Iravunk,"" Hayk Babukhanian, and his supporters ousted the party's long-time leader, Hrant Khachatrian. In February, Babukhanian said he was suspending publication of ""Iravunk"" due to threats by unidentified persons. Speaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Galadjian said that he suspected that Khachatrian and his supporters were involved in the attack. In an interview with RFE/RL today, Khachatrian denied personal involvement, but did not exclude the involvement of a third party, which he said could ""add fuel to the fire."" The alleged assault is currently being investigated by Yerevan's police.",,,

Arzumanian was released on September 6 after spending four months in prison on charges of money laundering and illegally receiving finances from abroad. ""Until Friday, I was a political prisoner; now I am a politically persecuted person,"" Arzumanian said. ""That ludicrous, fabricated charge has not been dropped, the political order is still there, and nobody has apologized for the four months I spent"" in jail. Armenian authorities have accused Arzumanian of illegally receiving large sums of money from a fugitive Russian businessman of Armenian descent. Armenian law-enforcement authorities say the charges have not been dropped, and that Arzumanian may still stand trial. Arzumanian's release came as a surprise to many, as one week earlier a Yerevan court had agreed to extend his arrest for another two months. But Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian said he personally ordered the release, as he did not think there were sufficient reasons for keeping him in jail. Arzumanian served as Armenia's foreign minister between 1996-1998, and is seen as one of the most loyal associates of former President Levon Ter-Petrosyan.

But Novruz Mamedov told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service that every time negotiations have reached a decisive moment, the Armenian side has found a reason to prevent such a meeting from taking place. Commenting on an upcoming visit by the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, which seeks to mediate a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Mamedov said that international mediators are reluctant to pass judgment on Armenia. He said that the states represented in the Minsk Group ""don't want to take concrete, decisive steps towards Armenia. Maybe it's a double standard. But this position is wrong."" The French, Russian, and U.S. co-chairs of the Minsk Group are due to visit Azerbaijan and Armenia this week.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1078559.html,Armenia Polls Suggest Presidential Race Is Wide Open ,"September 06, 2007 16:39 GMT",,,"Is Sarkisian's star falling? (file photo) (ITAR-TASS) September 6, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian is far from being Armenia's most popular politician at the moment, even though he is widely seen as the favorite to win the presidential election due in early 2008. One recent opinion poll ranks him in fourth place, after Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, opposition Zharangutiun party leader Raffi Hovannisian, and millionaire businessman Gagik Tsarukian, while a second poll found only 11 percent support for Sarkisian. Sarkisian to this point had been seen as the most likely successor to incumbent President Robert Kocharian, who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. The perception derives primarily from the control Sarkisian and his Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) exert over many government bodies, and from the vast financial resources at their disposal. Those levers are thought to have been the decisive factor in the HHK's landslide victory in the May 12 parliamentary elections. As in previous ballots, opposition parties cast doubts on the accuracy and fairness of the official results.Powerful Figures Gevorg Poghosian, director of the Armenian Sociological Association (ASA), on September 4 cited some of the hitherto unpublicized findings of a U.S.-funded opinion poll conducted by the ASA in July. That poll was the latest in a series of quarterly surveys designed and coordinated by the Gallup Organization. The U.S. International Republican Institute (IRI) began commissioning them last year with the aim of gauging public opinion on key issues facing Armenia. One of the questions some 1,200 Armenians randomly interviewed on July 5-12 were asked to answer was: ""Which presidential candidate would you vote for if the presidential elections were held next Sunday?"" Poghosian told RFE/RL that Sarkisian ranked only in fourth place, behind Oskanian, Hovannisian, and Tsarukian. Prime Minister Sarkisian and his party have vast financial resources at their disposal and exert significant control over many government bodies. Poghosian refused to reveal what percentage of support each of the four could count on, saying that the collated results of respondents' answers to the question are not subject to publication. But he said the pollsters have informed the politicians in question about their respective ratings. Poghosian did, however, disclose popular support, as measured by the ASA poll, for former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, who is reportedly considering running for president. He said it stands at about 1.7 percent. ""I don't see popular demand for the first president's return to power,"" he added. Of the potential candidates covered by the poll, only Hovannisian has publicized his rating -- 19 percent -- which is posted on the Zharangutiun website. Oskanian, who like Hovannisian is a former U.S. citizen, signaled late last year that he too might join the presidential race, thereby fuelling speculation that he, rather than Sarkisian, might succeed Kocharian. Kocharian for his part has not yet publicly commented on his preferred successor. A second opinion poll, conducted by the APR group, the findings of which were summarized on September 5 by the independent daily ""Aravot,"" registered 11 percent support for Sarkisian; he was followed by Hovannisian with 8.4 percent and Ter-Petrossian with 2.9 percent. Over one-third of the unspecified number of people polled -- almost 38 percent -- were unable to decide for whom they would vote if elections were held now. Recent statements by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), which signed a cooperation agreement with the coalition government formed after the May parliamentary ballot by the HHK and Tsarukian's Bargavach Hayastan (Prosperous Armenia) party, that it will field its own candidate in next year's presidential ballot rather than endorse Sarkisian's candidacy likewise call into question the perception that Sarkisian's victory is a given. Closing Ranks HHK parliament faction leader Karen Karapetian on August 27 downplayed the HHD's disinclination to endorse Sarkisian, predicting that Sarkisian will win the election even without the HHD's support. Karapetian further expressed confidence that Tsarukian's Prosperous Armenia, together with ""many other parties and NGOs,"" will close ranks behind Sarkisian. In the past, the findings of polls conducted by Poghosian's organization in the run-up to elections have served as a remarkably accurate indicator of the ultimate results. Opposition leaders have long accused Poghosian of permitting the Armenian leadership to misconstrue his findings as part of a broader effort to conceal and legitimize election fraud. Poghosian denies those accusations, insisting on the credibility of the ASA surveys. (With contributions from Astgik Bedevian and Emil Danielyan of RFE/RL's Armenian Service)",,,

And for those countries that might have fancied their membership chances, there was another clear signal: all European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) members are to be treated the same.A high-level conference on the EU's Neighborhood Policy opened in Brussels today, bringing together ministers and senior officials from all 27 EU member states and the 16 ENP countries and marking a revival in EU interest in its eastern and Mediterranean neighbors.In the morning, country representatives took to the floor in no set geographical order. In the afternoon, workshops on themes like ""Connecting Neighbors"" and ""Governance and Stability"" were styled to apply equally to all.This drive to display uniformity hides a key rift among the neighbors, as well as the EU member states. It papers over differences between the southern, Mediterranean countries who've been disqualified from EU membership, and eastern ex-Soviet states, most of whom still aspire to join the bloc.However, those membership aspirations may not be enough.'All Neighbors Equal'A key component of the opening speech of the conference, made by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, was a rejection of regional differentiation.""By focusing attention on the wider European and Mediterranean area, the ENP has leveraged more support from [the] European Union's member states than [if] we looked at each of our neighbors in isolation."" -- Barroso""By focusing attention on the wider European and Mediterranean area, the ENP has leveraged more support from [the] European Union's member states than [if] we looked at each of our neighbors in isolation,"" Barroso said.""And that was the first goal of our policy -- [in order] to leverage more support, to attract more attention, to focus, also, more resources,"" he added. ""Political resources, but also financial resources -- let's be frank [about that].""Barroso explained that without regional distinctions, the ENP remains free from the vagaries of the ""special interests"" of different EU members as they rotate the bloc's presidency among them.The evolving consensus within the EU is clearly skewed against further accessions, partly as a result of previous enlargements.Correspondingly, the EU is now putting less emphasis on political reforms and rights standards, which are crucial for candidate countries. Political standards were not raised by any of the EU headline speakers today.Economic FocusInstead, the EU is keen to capitalize on practical matters of mutual interest. Its current priorities for cooperation with the neighbors are economic integration, energy cooperation, increased travel and work opportunities, and increased financial and technical assistance.EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner underlined the bloc's economic ambitions. ""Our vision is of an economically integrated area, which spans the whole of the European Union and its closest European and Mediterranean partners,"" she said. ""An area where goods, services, and capital move freely.""With the EU as the world's largest importer of natural gas and oil, a key part of this vision is energy cooperation.Both Barroso and Ferrero-Waldner highlighted energy agreements already reached with Ukraine and Azerbaijan and about to be concluded with Algeria and Egypt.Ukraine, Moldova DisappointedBut not all the neighbors are happy with the way things are going. Ukraine conspicuously failed to dispatch its foreign minister to the conference, only being represented by its EU ambassador, Roman Shpek. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner speaking in Brussels today (official site)EU officials downplayed the slight, attributing it to Ukraine's upcoming parliamentary elections, but the bloc's diplomats privately acknowledge its significance. Ukraine has repeatedly made it clear that it only participates in the ENP reluctantly, and does not consider it an ""appropriate"" framework for its relations with the EU -- as it believes it is a European country and not a neighbor.Ukraine's sentiments are to a degree shared by neighboring Moldova. The country's foreign minister, Andrei Stratan, today openly criticized the bloc's limited ambitions:""The proposals presented by [the] European Commission in its report [in December 2006] on strengthening the ENP is already a big step forward, but [one] which still does not meet our expectations,"" he said. ""We consider that the basis for a solid relationship between the EU and Moldova -- taking into account its unequivocal European integration objective -- could be acceptance in the [EU's] 'four freedoms,'"" Stratan added.Stratan is specifically referring here to the EU's ""fourth freedom"" -- that provides for the free movement of people. The first three apply to the movement of capital, services, and goods and are part of the current ENP offer.Each Neighbor DifferentBelarus remains outside the bounds of the ENP as long as its authoritarian leader, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, shuns democratic reforms. The country was represented at the conference by a senior civil servant as an observer.Of the other eastern neighbors, Georgia chose to focus on its strive to get the EU to ease its visa restrictions. Currently, due to an EU-Russian visa-facilitation deal already in force, Russian passport holders in separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia enjoy easier access to the EU than Georgians.Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian expressed full satisfaction with the present course of the ENP. His Azerbaijani colleague, Elmar Mammadyarov, said he is also content to work within the ENP framework, highlighting Baku's interest in energy cooperation. Mammadyarov was the only speaker in the morning session to draw attention to rights standards, saying European cooperation required adherence to European standards and condemned unspecified instances of occupation and ethnic cleansing.(The ENP is composed of Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia, and Ukraine.)",,,

""The fundamental principle of the European Neighborhood Policy is, precisely, differentiation. The ENP is not and never has been a 'one-size-fits-all' policy,"" Barroso said. ""There are as many variations of the European Neighborhood Policy as there are partners. We cannot and do not wish to ignore the differences between our partners.""

Ferrero-Waldner also said the EU wants ""simpler, cheaper, and faster"" visa procedures within the neighborhood, and proposed a new system for ENP member to jointly address labor-migration issues. The European Commission ""has proposed a new system of 'mobility partnerships,' which we hope we can pilot with ENP countries,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""The idea, as the name suggests, is to focus on the joint responsibility of all countries to tackle the challenges posed by migration. So, it will cover both steps -- to combat, of course, illegal migration and to find more opportunities for legal migration from third countries to the European Union."" Addressing energy security, the commissioner announced the EU's plans to launch a feasibility study to identify shortfalls in its energy contracts with neighboring states. Lastly, Ferrero-Waldner unveiled two new mechanisms for providing ENP members with EU financial assistance. One, dubbed the Neighborhood Infrastructure Facility, will help offset transition costs and is expected to go into effect by the end of this year.

Russian authorities on August 29 also restricted imports of some Armenian agricultural products for the same reason.According to the ITAR-TASS news agency, the ban followed the release of the results of laboratory tests conducted in Armenia by Russian food-safety experts. They concluded that African swine fever, which rarely occurs outside Africa, was the cause of mass deaths of pigs reported from several villages in the Lori and Tavush regions bordering Georgia. The Armenian Agriculture Ministry arrived at the same conclusion on August 25-26, quarantining the affected communities. ""Transport of pork, live pigs, and animal fodder from those communities is banned,"" Grigor Baghian, the head of the ministry's Food Safety and Veterinary Inspectorate, told RFE/RL.Baghian said police and veterinary services have set up roadblocks outside those villages to enforce the quarantine. The authorities have also ordered a mandatory cull of all local pigs, he said, adding that more than a thousand of them have already been killed. Baghian said his agency believes that the disease spilled into Armenia from Georgia where an swine fever outbreak occurred on a larger scale earlier this summer. Tens of thousands of pigs have died or been culled there as a result. Although the disease poses little danger to humans, it seems to have already reduced pork consumption in Armenia. Pork was not available for sale in one of central Yerevan's main markets on August 29. ""People don't buy pork, and so we stopped selling it,"" one meat trader told RFE/RL.

Consolidating The OppositionA former member of the Yerkrapah fighters who took up arms in 1989 to defend Karabakh and then formed an influential political group, Bazeyan later joined former Prime Minister Aram Sargsian's Hanrapetutiun party, but left it in late 2005 after Sargsian abandoned his traditional pro-Russian stance for a more pro-Western orientation.Less than two years ago, Bazeyan ruled out any cooperation with Dashink, despite what he termed his ""friendly relations"" with Babayan personally, Noyan Tapan reported on January 30, 2006. Senior Dashink member Gnel Ghlechian said his party will probably hold an extraordinary congress in late September to formally endorse the merger with the HRAK. He explained the planned merger in terms of the conviction, shared by Babayan and his allies, that the Armenian opposition is currently too fragmented to pose a serious threat to the government, and must therefore consolidate. ""This unification, which I hope will materialize, is the way to go for all parties,"" Ghlechian told RFE/RL.None of the three parties cleared the 5 percent vote threshold to win seats in parliament under the system of proportional representation in the May 12 elections. Dashink won a single parliament seat in a constituency in northwestern Armenia, while the two other parties are not represented in the current National Assembly at all. Ghlechian would not say whether Babayan expects to become the chairman of the new, combined party. ""It is too early to speculate who will head it,"" he said. But HRAK Chairman Harutiun Arakelian has indicated that he would not object to Babayan taking over the new party. ""I personally would not take such a development painfully,"" he told RFE/RL. ""My task is to make the party stronger and to double or triple the number of its members and structures.""The HRAK, which has an eponymous sister organization in the Armenian diaspora, has been loyal to President Robert Kocharian throughout his nearly decadelong rule. Dashink and National Revival, by contrast, claim to be in opposition to Kocharian. It is not clear whether the three parties plan to field a single candidate in next year's presidential election. Ghlechian was quoted by the independent daily ""Aravot"" on August 2 as saying that Babayan has no intention of participating in that ballot.",,,

Ahead of the talks, Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Nasir Hamidi Zare met in Baku with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov. RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service spoke to the Iranian envoy after today's meeting. RFE/RL: Azerbaijan has close ties with the United States. Does this hurt relations between Iran and Azerbaijan? Nasir Hamidi Zare: Neither Azerbaijan's relations with other countries nor our relations with other countries limit our bilateral ties. During past meetings with Ilham Aliyev, he has stated that Azerbaijan is interested in having close, neighborly, friendly relations with Iran. Azerbaijan has demonstrated its stance on this issue. Our president, [Mahmud] Ahmadinejad, has said we are open to bigger and better relations with Azerbaijan. RFE/RL: Will Iran's recent difficulties with the international community be discussed during Ahmadinejad's visit to Baku? Zare: This trip is meant to discuss issues of mutual cooperation. Other issues, of course, will be discussed as well. Presidents never limit the scope of their discussions to a narrow agenda. But, of course, the most important issue in Baku will be improving bilateral relations. RFE/RL: Can Azerbaijan serve as a mediator in helping to improve relations between the United States and Iran? Zare: When our president traveled to the United States [in September 2005], he said he was ready for dialogue. But if one side doesn't want to change its position, what can Azerbaijan do about it? Despite all the scandalous reports you see in the newspapers and on television, we hear that the American people, and the highest levels of American government, want to have sincere and close relations with Iran. If you put all the bad press aside, you see that there are logical people in every country. Of course, policies are decided by governments, but nothing can stop people from having good relations. RFE/RL: How do you view the U.S. role in Iraq? Zare: The United States is now living in an era of coalition. I don't think America is a unilateral power anymore. The coalition is getting weaker and the occupation isn't working. You can see that the Islamic Republic of Iran is cooperating on Iraqi issues. You can see that they [the U.S.-led coalition] is backing off. RFE/RL: What is your stance on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict? Zare: It's our stated policy that we support Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and will continue to do so. Azerbaijan is a neighbor and a Muslim state, and of course this relationship is more important for us than our relations with other countries. Azerbaijan is taking steps to resolve this conflict. We'd like to see the conflict resolved -- that refugees go back to their homes, that they receive compensation. This is my personal opinion, but it also reflects the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This occupation should be condemned. RFE/RL: Are you concerned by talks on whether the United States will use the Qabala radar station in Azerbaijan as part of its missile-defense shield? Will this issue be discussed during Ahmadinejad's visit? Zare: The Azerbaijani people and the Azerbaijani government should be more concerned about this issue than we are. Russia and the United States act like the state of Azerbaijan doesn't even exist when they negotiate on the issue. But when you take Azerbaijan's sovereignty and independence into account, you have to look at this policy from a different point of view. You know that, and we know that. Our history has been marked by many events that I'm not going to discuss now. But we're watching [talks on Qabala] very carefully and sensitively. Because we see peace and stability in Azerbaijan as peace and stability in Iran. And if others would like to play games in the name of security, neither the state of Azerbaijan nor its people will accept it. The question is being discussed between two countries, Russia and the United States. What aspect of the issue can we discuss here in Baku? Everyone knows this is a sensitive subject. All the necessary exchanges of opinion will be made during our talks.",,,

A number of top government officials, including President Robert Kocharian, were at the opening of the weeklong games, which gather 2,500 amateur athletes from Armenia and the Armenian diaspora. Vardges Gasparian, a representative of the opposition movement Aylentrank (Alternative), told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that three of the group's members were detained after distributing leaflets calling for the release of individuals they consider political prisoners. They were released only after the intervention of the Aylentrank leader Nikol Pashinian, according to Gasparian.

It's a charge Russia denies. RFE/RL Azerbaijani Service acting Director Kenan Aliyev spoke to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Daniel Fried about the latest developments in Georgia and the hopes for peace in Nagorno-Karabakh. They also discussed the results of the August 3 round of the U.S.-Azerbaijani dialogue on democracy and human rights.RFE/RL: Are you concerned about the latest developments in Georgia? What is the U.S. position on this issue? Daniel Fried: We are very concerned. In fact we condemned, we condemn this attack. We have been in close touch with the Georgian government, which has shown us the evidence it has. The evidence seems to show that there was an overflight, an incursion. We, at the same time, urge both Georgia and Russia to continue to work together cooperatively, to resolve issues related to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We think that it would be a terrible mistake if this latest incident, as bad as it is, derailed some of the progress that has been made and we hope both sides continue to work together. I should also add that we've been in touch with the Russian government, both in Washington and Moscow, and we're aware that the Russian government has denied any involvement in these attacks. We've also been assured that the Russian government wants to work with Georgia in a constructive spirit and we hope that now the way forward is for Russia and Georgia to cooperate both on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but also to cooperate in the Georgian investigation of this incident. We're going to follow it closely, we're going to evaluate the information. I must say there is absolutely no evidence that I've seen that this is somehow a Georgian provocation. This doesn't appear to be the case at all. It was certainly a problem, but not one of Georgia's making. So while we're clear about the problem that exists we also want both sides to work together and the indications are that both the Georgian and Russian governments are going to continue to work together and if that is the case we welcome it. RFE/RL: And what is the status of the discussion of the radar station at Qabala in Azerbaijan? Is this off the table? Fried: We're consulting with the Russians about this. We thought [Russian President Vladimir] Putin made a very interesting offer. We immediately made sure, of course, that the Azerbaijani government was comfortable with it. We're not going to do something with Russia that involves anything on Azerbaijani territory without consulting the government of Azerbaijan. It affects the sovereign territory of that country. It's on the table, we want to work with Russia, we see the Russian offer as interesting and promising. It's not a substitute for what we want to do with the Poles and Czechs, but we see rather that all of these ideas -- the American ideas with the Poles and the Czechs, the Russian ideas with Qabala and their own radar installations in southern Russia, European projects for short- and mid-range missile defense-- the best case would be for all of these [proposals] to be brought together in a large compatible system that provided everybody with the best possible protection. RFE/RL: With both Armenia and Azerbaijan entering their election cycles, are you less optimistic about the chances for success in the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process and do you think that the presidents have missed an opportunity?Fried: I don't want to be critical, I think that we were all disappointed that the last trip of the Contact Group didn't yield the results we had hoped. There have been good negotiations, well good talks I should say, some progress has been made and at some point I hope that the leaders of the two countries will find a way forward. Ultimately, it's in everyone's interests. The future of Azerbaijan will be under a cloud as long as this issue is not resolved and it can only be resolved peacefully. A war is going to destroy Azerbaijan's future and do no one any good. A peaceful settlement is the way to go. We've come this far and I hope that we can resolve it.RFE/RL: Can you tell us about the latest round of the U.S.-Azerbaijan democracy and human-rights dialogue? What are your main concerns in terms of Azerbaijan's democratic development? Fried: Step back a little bit. Azerbaijan is emerging in two senses. It's emerging from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and it's also emerging in its own right as a nation and it takes both political will and time to build functioning democratic institutions. So we want to be very clear about problems that exist -- and there are problems in the media in particular -- but we also want to work with Azerbaijan to build institutions, to help Azerbaijan build the institutions of free media and the practice of free media and we're going to tackle these issues one at a time. RFE/RL: Many critics of U.S. policy in Azerbaijan point to the fact that the United States has strategic relations with Azerbaijan, when it comes to security and energy. But they say that the United States is not tough enough on the democracy-development issues in Azerbaijan.Fried: I'm aware of the charge but it just isn't true. If we didn't care about democracy issues, we wouldn't be having this dialogue. The Azerbaijani authorities know very well that this is important to us and that progress in this area will mean that our relations are deeper and stronger. Lack of progress means the problems will be a constant drag on our relations. Obviously some of the NGOs and the human-rights organizations in Baku are principally concerned with the problems of democracy in that country, and the shortcomings, and I don't blame them. We keep in good contact with them and we share some of their concerns, but we've got to find the right way to pursue all of our interests at once and not allow our interests in security or economics to drown out our relations in greater freedom and, at the same time, not allow our interests and commitment to freedom paralyze us from cooperation in other areas. Saying that is one thing, doing it is another, and we will do our best. RFE/RL: Can we expect that there will be any immediate results of this ongoing dialogue? For example, do you think the government will release the seven imprisoned journalists? The U.S. State Department, the U.S. government, and international organizations have all raised this issue many times. Fried: They certainly should find a way to resolve this problem. I can't promise you what the actions will be because the Azerbaijani government will make its determination and the processes there will work and hopefully there will be good results but I can't guarantee this. What I can say though is that we will continue to raise these issues even when it is difficult for the Azerbaijani government to hear it. We will continue to raise it. But I also don't want to leave the impression that our discussions are confrontational. They were not. [Azerbaijani] Foreign Minister [Elmar] Mammadyarov knows Americans very well. He knows our concerns, he knows how serious we are about expressing them. I think he approached this in good faith, he listened carefully, and we also had a discussion about areas where we can work together. RFE/RL: You're in constant contact with the Azerbaijani authorities. Do you have a sense that the Azerbaijani government is really committed to democratic reform?Fried: I think that the government has a vision of a modernized, well-run country and I think that they are more inclined to work with us on projects of building institutions. I think some of the problems exist with respect to individual cases and represent, frankly, the lack of such institutions. Azerbaijan still needs to build a strong, independent judiciary. It needs to strengthen the rule of law, it needs to strengthen sanctity of contracts, it needs to build independent institutions of government, which will be credible regulators of the economy. So it has a lot to do. I think that the Azerbaijani government is more inclined to build new institutions and I think that the problems arise when individual cases come up and are not handled well by the institutions that now exist. Now that's a general view, that's my observation. I wouldn't argue that it's accurate in all respects, but it's my effort to give a general picture of what we see.",,,

Azerbaijan has condemned the Nagorno-Karabakh elections as illegal and illegitimate. ""Azerbaijan's position is firm and has not changed,"" Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Khazar Ibrahim told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service this week. ""These so-called elections are illegal with no legal effect.

""These authorities are elected and that is better than not having anybody in power at all in Nagorno-Karabakh. If there were not elections, if there was anarchy there, it would be worse."" -- political commentator Abramian The predominantly ethnic-Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan's borders. Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war over the region from 1988 until a 1994 cease-fire was brokered. The conflict has been frozen ever since, and negotiations continue on its future status. The Organization for Secuirty and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- like the rest of the international community -- does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh and therefore considers the elections to be illegitimate. Harri Kamarainen, the head of the Caucasus Department at the OSCE's Conflict Prevention Center, says that the issue of the elections has come up in discussions between Armenian and Azerbaijan -- where it has proven to be an irritant. ""The fact that elections take place and the authorities in Karabakh organize these is somewhat of an irritating factor for the Azerbaijani side,"" Kamarainen says. NATO spokesman James Appathurai today said that the alliance, ""like other international organizations,"" will not recognize any polls held by the breakaway region. Aram Abramian, a political commentator and editor in chief of the Yerevan-based daily newspaper ""Aravot,"" says however that the elections will have little effect on the peace process itself since authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh are not party to the negotiations. ""Under the current negotiating format he [the Nagorno-Karabakh president] will not participate,"" Abramian says. ""Everything depends on the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Therefore, at this stage, in any case, the role of the leadership in Nagorno-Karabakh is of secondary importance."" Resolution Sought On July 13, the French, Russian, and U.S. co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, which seeks to mediate a resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, called on Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to prepare for a new summit ""at the first opportunity."" The two last met on the sidelines of an informal CIS summit in St. Petersburg in June. Sahakian's main challenger for the presidency is Deputy Foreign Minister Masis Maylian. Other candidates include parliament deputy Armen Abgarian; Nagorno-Karabakh Communist Party leader Hrant Melkumian; and Vanya Avanesian, a professor at Artsakh State University. Maylian has accused Nagorno-Karabakh authorities of favoring Sahakian's candidacy over the others. Incumbent Arkady Ghukasian cannot run in the election, having served the maximum two terms. Elections with predictable -- or even preordained, as some have alleged -- results are commonplace in frozen-conflict zones. In the past eight months, three other breakaway regions in the former Soviet Union -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia, and Transdniester in Moldova -- have held either parliamentary or presidential elections. And in each case there were no surprises. Candidates or parties backed by the local separatist elite -- and their patrons in Moscow -- won by overwhelming margins. Abramian says the trend reflects a general pattern not just in conflict zones but in much of the former Soviet Union where manipulated elections increasingly serve as tool to legitimize the ruling political clan. ""It is completely clear who will win this election,"" Abramian says. ""I don't really like this Chekist [eds: former member of the Soviet KGB] who will be the president. But on the other hand, this is not a problem [only] of Nagorno-Karabakh. It is a reflection of all the regimes in the CIS, including those that are [internationally] recognized."" Frozen Status Abramian added that the election will neither improve nor harm the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. ""In Nagorno-Karabakh there needs to be some kind of authority,"" Abramian notes. ""This authority must either be elected, appointed, or inherited. These authorities are elected and that is better than not having anybody in power at all in Nagorno-Karabakh. If there were not elections, if there was anarchy there, it would be worse. This way it won't be better and it won't be worse.""

Kocharian said Armenia is currently not aiming for EU membership either. ""We are realistic,"" he said. Although Kocharian's remarks do not represent a shift in Armenia's foreign policy, they are more blunt than previous declarations. Analysts in Armenia believe the president, whose term of office ends next year, has decided to stress relations with Russia as Armenia's highest foreign-policy priority. At the same time, Armenia is concerned about maintaining relations with Iran, a major strategic and trading partner. Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, who seems poised to succeed Kocharian as president, told Reuters recently that NATO membership would not guarantee Armenia's security. He noted that NATO member Turkey has been keeping Armenia's border closed for years and added that Turkey is not a ""predictable"" factor, noting that Turkey was a NATO member when the Cyprus conflict erupted in 1974. Public opinion in Armenia remains divided on the issue of NATO membership.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1077614.html,Russia Moscow Content To Block Kosovo Resolution ,"July 13, 2007 15:17 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) July 13, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Once again the Western powers have attempted to find the right formula for compromise on Kosovo, and once again Russia has rejected it. Russia on July 12 turned down a third draft resolution on Kosovo based on a plan submitted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari that provides a framework for independent statehood under the supervision of the European Union. The latest version, taking into account Russian objections to the previous proposals, extends to four months the amount of time allocated for talks between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians on the future status of the province. The proposal, circulated at the UN by French and British delegates, also reportedly contained a condition under which the Ahtisaari plan would no longer automatically go into effect if the two sides failed to reach an agreement.'Nothing New'Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing journalists on July 12, said the last document differed little from the previous versions aside from its wording.""We can only support a draft resolution that isacceptable to both sides, Pristina and Belgrade. So far we see no suchagreement."" -- Lavrov""Behind the rather intricate diplomatic language of the draft resolution, there is a conclusion that after 120 days, whether or not the sides reach an agreement, the Ahtisaari plan will come into effect,"" he said. ""And as you know we can only support a draft resolution that is acceptable to both sides, Pristina and Belgrade. So far we see no such agreement."" Essentially, Lavrov made clear that there is little room for compromise on Russia's part, unless Serbia agrees to independence for Kosovo, a development most pundits consider unrealistic. In Belgrade, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica quickly rejected the new draft proposal, and back in Moscow, Konstantin Kosachyov, the chairman of the State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the ""situation In Kosovo does not require an immediate solution.""Nevertheless, Lavrov assured journalists, ""the problem of a decision on the independence of Kosovo has not been taken off the agenda.""Exchanging PolemicsRegardless, the latest Russian rejection has already led UN envoy Ahtisaari and Lavrov to engage in a new round of polemics.Speaking in Helsinki, Ahtisaari said Moscow's reluctance to work out a compromise could further harm Russia image abroad. ""Rather than strengthening its international position, Russia only weakens it,"" he said. Lavrov, however, dismissed Ahtisaari's remark. ""If he really said this, I consider his statement to be inappropriate. Maybe such a statement could reduce another country's international status, but not Russia's,"" Lavrov said on July 13. He added: ""If, in the course of considerations, one of the parties cannot accept these proposals [by Ahtisaari], negotiations should continue and they should be assisted by an impartial international mediator.""Hard-Line StanceLavrov's comments are in keeping with the position Russia has long held on the issue, one that has led it to hint that it might veto the plan if it reaches the UN Security Council.As recently as July 9, Lavrov said that any solution not agreeable to both Serbia and Kosovo ""cannot make it through the Security Council."" Prior to that, responding to recent comments by U.S. officials, Lavrov said in a June 26 interview with RTR that ""statements that that independence for Kosovo is inevitable do not convince us."" Lavrov sees little need to compromise (AFP file photo)Although most pundits agree that Moscow's veto threats are no bluff, they differ in their interpretations of the Kremlin's hard-line stance. When considering Moscow's motivation for its position, most cite Moscow's desire to extract concessions on other issues, to prevent a separatist trend within the Russian Federation, and to defend the inviolability of countries' territorial integrity. Other analysts believe that Russia seeks to use the possibility of an independent Kosovo as leverage against neighboring states that seek closer ties with the West.President Vladimir Putin, for instance, has repeatedly said that an independent Kosovo could serve as a precedent for the frozen conflicts in Georgia, whose pro-Moscow regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia seek independence, and in Moldova, whose pro-Moscow Transdniester region also wants statehood.Political HeadacheIn reality, however, Moscow is currently less fearful of seeing independence movements sparked within its ethnic republics, such as Chechnya, and does not really want to alter the status of breakaway republics in CIS states either.If, for example, the independence of Kosovo were declared (a development that many consider inevitable) Russia would logically have to keep promises it has already made to the leaders of the breakaway republics and recognize their independent status. But in doing so, for example, regarding Abkhazia, Russia would also be forced to define its position on the hotly contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the source of a bitter armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 1988-94. But whatever decision Moscow makes on Karabakh, whether it be recognition or ignorance of its independent status, it can be assured of angering either Armenia or Azerbaijan.Russia understandably would like to avoid such a political headache, and will seek to preserve the status quo rather than risk taking a stance on the principle of self-determination as opposed to territorial integrity.Fixing Past MistakesThere is also another factor in Moscow's persistence on the Kosovo issue. It relates to Russia's role in the Balkans in 1990s, when the country, under President Boris Yeltsin, cooperated with NATO and the United States in trying to resolve the Yugoslav crisis. At that time, then-Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin flew to Belgrade to convince late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to deal with the West. But in hindsight, Moscow now looks upon its decision as an embarrassing example of weakness and concession and would like to make amends.As Sergei Karaganov, the head of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy and a political adviser to Putin's administration, noted in a commentary on kremlin.org on 16 June, ""Many in Moscow now want American and European colleagues to pay the full price for their games in Kosovo, although they do not want to admit it publicly."" In seeking to make up for its retreat from the Balkans in the past decade, Moscow has located the ""weak link"" in the West's position on Kosovo. Russia realizes that any unilateral declaration of independence for Kosovo that does not follow UN procedure will not be recognized by all members of the European Union, and could cause a rift within the bloc.Russia designed its strategy on Kosovo based on this calculation.Tired Of CooperationA good way of describing this strategy can be found in a recent comment by Aleksei Pushkov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst for NTV, who said on his show ""Postkriptum"" on 7 July that Russia should not ""help the U.S. and EU escape from the difficult situation in Kosovo."" He also listed reasons for testing the West's mettle on Kosovo.First, he said, Russia has previously tried to cooperate with the United States and NATO -- particularly in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001 -- and has come away disappointed. He said that if Russia does not get the concessions it seeks on Kosovo, it ""will not see reciprocal steps toward us neither on the issue of U.S. missile-defense elements in Europe, nor on other issues on which we differ.""Second, the situation over Kosovo belongs to a category of ""who will overplay whom."" The Western media writes about it in terms of the EU being hostage to the Russia position and that Russia should be not allowed to define EU foreign policy, Pushkov said, but this is the language of competition, not cooperation. Therefore, if Russia were to alter its position on Kosovo toward compromise ""it would be perceived [by the West] not as act of partnership, but as the defeat of a competitor who surrendered to pressure.""Pushkov's third point was that Russia's confrontation with the West on Kosovo is a matter of principle.The main criteria, according to Pushkov, is whether Russia will return to the international arena as an independent player.""Putin wants to turn the Kosovo [issue] into a demonstration that Russia has regained its clout. If we retreat, we will once again we be considered to be feeble,"" Pushkov wrote. ""If we stand, our claims to a role of significance will be justified.""In the end, even a brief analysis of Moscow public-opinion leaders' statements on Kosovo shows that the Kremlin -- due to its interpretations of the country's ambitions and national interests -- is not interested in a quick resolution of the Kosovo problem.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1077613.html,NagornoKarabakh Who Will Be The Next President ,"July 13, 2007 14:31 GMT",,,"By Liz Fuller and Richard Giragosian http://gdb.rferl.org/2fefb570-a62b-44a2-8337-158b435a58b0_w203.jpg Arkady Ghukasian, shown here in 2002, will have to vote for another candidate this year (file photo) (epa) July 13, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- On July 19, voters in the unrecognized republic of Nagorno-Karabakh will elect a successor to Arkady Ghukasian, the former foreign minister who has served two successive presidential terms since 1997, when his predecessor Robert Kocharian was named Armenian prime minister. Of the five registered candidates, the clear favorite is Bako Sahakian, who resigned as National Security Service chairman to register for the ballot. Sahakian is backed by Ghukasian's Democratic Artsakh Party (ZhAK); by the two opposition parties represented in the republican parliament; and by the current Armenian leadership, which implies that he is also considered acceptable by Moscow. Unfair Support? Sahakian's main challenger, Deputy Foreign Minister Masis Maylian, has accused the republican authorities of unfairly promoting Sahakian's candidacy to the detriment of his rivals, while a recent opinion poll indicated that 19 percent of respondents do not believe the upcoming ballot will be free and fair. The five candidates participating in the ballot are Sahakian, who is 49 and made his career in the Soviet-era Committee for State Security (KGB); Maylian, who is in his late 30s and a graduate of the Vienna Diplomatic Academy; parliament deputy Armen Abgarian; Nagorno-Karabakh Communist Party leader Hrant Melkumian; and Vanya Avanesian, a professor at Artsakh State University. Ghukasian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive presidential term. Ghukasian's ZhAK signaled its support for Sahakian's candidacy on April 20, the first day for nominating candidates. Azat Hayrenik (Free Fatherland), the junior partner in the ruling coalition, followed suit: some 450 delegates to a party congress on May 28 unanimously affirmed their support for Sahakian, regnum.ru reported. Two opposition parties likewise backed Sahakian's candidacy, the Movement-88 and, somewhat surprisingly, the Karabakh chapter of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), which is aligned with the new Armenian coalition government. Many observers had anticipated that the HHD would support Maylian, especially in light of a statement the party issued in April harshly criticizing the republican government's policies. Sahakian himself told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on June 20 that he is ""proud"" that both pro-government and opposition forces support him, and sees ""nothing illogical"" in that support. There appear to be few fundamental differences between the various candidates' programs: all acknowledge the need to improve rural infrastructure, including roads, irrigation systems, and schools, and to reduce unemployment and raise living standards. More Expected Sahakian and Maylian both implied that they would expect greater commitment and honesty from government employees. Maylian called for ""real reforms,"" and outlined a tough stance for negotiations on ending the conflict with Azerbaijan. He argued, specifically, that ""negotiations between the NKR and Azerbaijan on delimiting borders can begin only after the unconditional recognition of the sovereignty and state independence of the NKR,"" regnum.ru reported on July 2. He has also advocated settling Armenian families on the districts of Azerbaijan currently occupied by Armenian forces, but it is not clear whether he unequivocally opposes the return of those territories to Azerbaijani control as part of a peace deal. Maylian also said that Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh should have a single shared system of national security, possibly implying a unified military command structure with Karabakh forces subordinate to the Armenian Defense Ministry in Yerevan. President Kocharian's adviser has told journalists that the election campaign in Karabakh ""is unique in the entire post-Soviet space,"" and he dismissed out of hand disparaging and unsavory rumors about Sahakian. Before the election campaign formally got under way, Karabakh-based independent analyst David Karabekian noted that the five candidates represent a broader spectrum of political and social interests than was the case in previous elections, and he dismissed fears that the level of support expressed for Sahakian effectively rendered the outcome of the vote a foregone conclusion, regnum.ru reported on May 16. And on July 10, Karabekian dismissed as ""primitive logic"" the supposition that the authorities in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh reached agreement that Sahakian should succeed Ghukasian as president, and that Maylian's role is little more than that of ""sparring partner."" Just days after the formal start on June 20 of the election campaign, Maylian's campaign manager Sergei Kalantarian complained that an anchor on NKR state television was openly agitating in favor of Sahakian, regnum.ru reported on June 25. A local government official in the northern Mardakert district was reportedly forced into early retirement on June 7 for openly saying he planned to vote for Maylian. And in Yerevan, Igor Muradian, a veteran participant in the 1988 campaign to persuade the Soviet leadership to transfer Karabakh from Azerbaijani to Armenian jurisdiction, alleged that outgoing President Ghukasian was orchestrating a pro-Sahakian campaign, pulling out all the stops to ensure he is elected. Ghukasian for his part has characterized the election campaign as ""close to ideal,"" regnum.ru reported on July 3, while Central Election Commission Chairman Sergei Nasibian described it as ""proceeding normally."" In Yerevan, President Kocharian's adviser Garnik Isagulian told journalists on July 10 that the election campaign in Karabakh ""is unique in the entire post-Soviet space,"" and he dismissed out of hand disparaging and unsavory rumors about Sahakian, regnum.ru reported. Isagulian described Sahakian's candidacy as ""acceptable for everyone,"" and predicted that 80 percent of the electorate will vote for him. By contrast, a survey of 700 people conducted by the Sociometer center showed that 45 percent would vote for Sahakian and 5 percent for Mayilian, Noyan Tapan reported on June 18; a second survey by the same pollster two weeks later showed support for the two men at 60 percent and maximum 10 percent, respectively. Free And Fair Addressing students in Yerevan on July 2, Ghukasian pledged to ensure that the July 19 vote is free and fair, stressing that his republic ""always holds the best election in the post-Soviet space,"" even if the international community declines to recognize the vote as legal and valid, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Voters in Karabakh appear to think otherwise, however: according to a poll conducted in late June by the Independent Center for Humanitarian and Political Studies, 19 percent of the respondents said they do not believe the July 19 election will be free and fair, while a further 16 percent said they do not think their vote ""will change anything."" Those perceptions are very probably based on the assumption that the preferences of the unrecognized republic's voters take second place to the strategic plans of the Armenian and Russian leaderships. As in the case of earlier presidential and parliamentary elections in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has denounced the planned vote as lacking legitimacy and ""aimed at concealing Armenia's policy of annexation and...strengthening the ongoing occupation of Azerbaijani territory.""",,,

The legislation would have banned foreign broadcasts on Armenian public television and radio and heavily taxed their retransmission on private stations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had said the proposals, which passed its first reading on June 29, amounted to a ""ban on RFE/RL"" and could have made Armenia's March 2008 presidential elections less free and fair. The measure didn't pass in today's second and final reading because opposition, independent, and even some pro-government lawmakers blocked a quorum by boycotting two separate votes. MORE: Coverage in Armenian from RFE/RL's Armenian Service. Human Rights Watch , meanwhile, had called the legislative package a potential blow to media freedom in general. But today's failed vote in parliament, where just enough lawmakers boycotted the vote to prevent a quorum, means the government must start over if it wants to try again to pass the legislation. That involves redrafting the proposals and resubmitting them again for a new first reading. Victor Dalakian, an independent member of parliament, was one of the more outspoken critics of the legislation introduced by the government. ""The minority proved that quality is more important than quantity, and this would be a lesson for the parliamentary majority, that it should respect one of the most important rights: liberty,"" Dalakian told RFE/RL. But it wasn't just the minority that doomed the draft legislation. It didn't pass in today's second and final reading because opposition, independent, and even some pro-government lawmakers blocked a quorum by boycotting two separate votes. In the first attempt, only 64 votes were cast (63 for, none against, one abstention) in the 131-member parliament. In the second try, 65 votes were cast (63 for, none against, two abstentions). Both fell short of the 66 votes necessary for a quorum. The votes came one day after the U.S. State Department weighed in. On July 2, following a question during a press briefing, the State Department issued a statement in which it suggested the proposed legislation was unlikely to further Armenia's ""stated desire for continued democratization, particularly in the wake of the May parliamentary elections that marked a step forward even as they reflected the need for further improvements toward democratic standards."" The demonstration in Yerevan on July 2 (RFE/RL)""We are pleased that there will now be more time for civil society to engage with Armenian lawmakers on this issue,"" Tom Mittnacht, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, told RFE/RL after the vote today. ""We appreciate the substantive and active dialogue we have had with the speaker of the assembly. We are happy that Radio Liberty will be able to continue broadcasting."" Speaker Tigran Torosian and other officials had argued that the legislation would actually not have affected RFE/RL broadcasts. But that position, given the legislation's wording, left observers both inside and outside the country puzzled. That's because the legislation clearly spelled out sharp disincentives for private Armenian radio stations to carry foreign broadcasters' programs. They would have had to pay more than $200 in taxes each time they retransmitted a program produced by a foreign media organization. That is about 70 times more than broadcasters must pay for a locally made program. (RFE/RL's Armenian Service contributed to this report)",,,

Under the draft amendment, Armenian broadcasters would have to pay the equivalent of $205 in taxes for each aired program made by a foreign media organization. The legislation would also bar all media outlets from broadcasting on frequencies used by the state-controlled Public Television and Radio Company. Some media observers have said that the measures are primarily aimed against RFE/RL, which broadcasts in Armenia via public and private affiliates and has a bureau in Yerevan. Azerbaijani Model? In neighboring Azerbaijan, the national independent TV and radio channel, ANS, was barred from airing foreign broadcasts from the beginning of this year after authorities said it lacked the proper licenses.

Europe's soccer governing body said in a June 23 statement that it had decided to cancel the two matches ""as no suitable compromise can be found."" As a result, both teams will receive zero points. The two matches were to be played in September. But the soccer associations from both countries couldn't agree on where. Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan have been sour since the early 1990s when they fought a war over the predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia did not object to the matches taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan.But Azerbaijan wanted the games held on neutral territory. Baku said it would be difficult to guarantee the safety of the Armenian players on Azerbaijani territory.Official ReactionChief coach of the Azerbaijani soccer team, Shahin Diniyev, said the decision came as a surprise.""We were gathering information and preparing to play right up until the final day. I'd say that, after this decision was announced, neither teams are winners or losers,"" Diniyev said.The head of the Armenian Football Federation Ruben Hairapetian thought that Armenia was the definite loser from the decision.""It was bad for Armenia because our national team is stronger. It was a chance [for us] to gain more points in the tournament,"" Hairapetian said.In the Euro 2008 qualifying Group A, Armenia lies in fifth place, with Azerbaijan bringing up the rear. Poland are the group leaders, followed by Serbia, Portugal, and Finland.Despite the UEFA decision, both teams would have little chance of qualifying for the Euro 2008 championship, to be held in Austria and Switzerland next year.Disappointed FansIn Yerevan, soccer fans' reactions were mixed.""There is no doubt that it was a political decision, because they could have played in a neutral country. And there is no doubt that we would have won the game. That's why, by taking this unjust decision, they wanted to make it easier, to avoid headaches,"" one fan said. But another Armenian fan thought UEFA was right. ""It punished both of them. It was a very good decision. It said to both teams, just go away,"" he said.Fans in Baku who spoke to RFE/RL were no different. ""It would be better if they met. In this case, we would know our team's ability. I was expecting a lot fm this [match]. It's a pity that they will not play together,"" one male fan said.Another believed it was the right decision, due to the safety aspects.""It's a fair decision, because anything could happen [at a game between the two],"" he said.Previous matches between Armenian and Azerbaijani teams -- at an international and club level -- have been marred by difficulties. At a Commonwealth Cup game in 2005, there were fights between players from Armenia's Pyunik Yerevan and Azerbaijan's Neftchi Baku. The cup brings together all the league champions from the 15 former Soviet republics. And a return fixture between the two teams to be played in Moscow in January 2006 never took place. Pyunik Yerevan withdrew, saying it feared for the safety of its players.(RFE/RL's Armenia and Azerbaijani services provided the material for this report)",,,

But the summit opened with a warning from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that political conflicts and territorial disputes were hindering economic progress in the region.The message was in keeping with efforts by Turkey, which currently chairs the BSEC, to restore new life to the organization.By the end of the day, some states were showing signs that they were open to reconciliation.An RFE/RL correspondent in Istanbul said that in a rare bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit, Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian made an unexpected proposal to his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul.Oskanian told a press conference that if Turkey is ""serious about a dialogue, please open the border first. If the borders between our two countries are open, the Armenian side is willing at a governmental level to create any kind of commission that is needed to address whatever bilateral issues stand in the way of the normalization of our ties.""Turkey and Armenia currently have no diplomatic relations and Armenia was the only country at the summit to be represented by a foreign minister.

The Russian daily ""Kommersant,"" citing an unidentified ""source in the Georgian government,"" reported that Georgia would seek to convince Russia to give up its support for South Ossetian secessionist leader Eduard Kokoity. In exchange, according to the source, Georgia would be willing to support Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization. But it was not to be. RFE/RL's correspondent said that in the end the two ministers were able to meet only briefly because they did not want to disrupt the summit's agenda.After their closed-door talks, however, the two ministers did take the time to deny reports of the potential breakthrough reported by ""Kommersant."" Interfax quoted Lavrov as saying he was ""amazed"" by the article, while Bezhuashvili said that ""neither Georgia nor Russia base their policy on a newspaper article and journalists' opinion.""Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, also in attendance, did promise a breakthrough in resolving the conflict with the breakaway region.Economic Cooperation Tops AgendaHigh on the group's agenda were plans to reduce trade barriers, and to develop transportation infrastructure -- including a proposal to build a 7,500-kilometer ring road along the Black Sea coast.

Leaders of 12 countries in the wider Black Sea region are due to discuss projects aimed at boosting economic cooperation and trade. The summit marks the 15th anniversary of the grouping, which was founded following the collapse of the Soviet Union with an aim to promote stability and economic ties in the region. High on the group's agenda today are plans to develop transportation infrastructure, including a proposal to build a 7,500-kilometer ring road along the Black Sea coast. The group will also seek to reduce trade barriers. Turkey, which currently chairs the BSEC, says it wants to give the organization new momentum. Territorial Disputes The meeting, however, is overshadowed by territorial disputes including the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and between Russia and Moldova over Transdniester. Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian and his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul held a rare -- and brief -- meeting on the sidelines of the conference to discuss their troubled relations. Armenia, which has no diplomatic relations with Turkey, is the only country to send its foreign minister to the BSEC summit instead of its president. Turkey refuses to establish relations with Armenia because of Yerevan's attempts to get the mass killing of Armenians during World War I recognized internationally as genocide. A scheduled meeting between the Russian and Georgian foreign ministers was being watched closely, following a published report that Georgia would use the opportunity to discuss its breakaway region of South Ossetia.

Echoing similarly upbeat statements over the preceding weeks by the co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group that seeks to mediate between the conflict sides, Moratinos declared that ""the parties today are close to a settlement,"" and urged the two sides to ""take the important moment to achieve progress in the negotiations."" In the event, however, the three-hour talks between Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the CIS summit in St. Petersburg on June 9 failed to yield any progress toward overcoming the most serious remaining points of disagreement between the two sides. And on June 20, the two sides implicitly blamed each other for that failure. Even before the St. Petersburg meeting, the Minsk Group co-chairmen switched tack and downplayed the remarks by Moratinos. The U.S. co-chair, Matthew Bryza, said that while the extent of the remaining differences between the two sides is narrowing, ""we cannot say that this time we expect a turning point in St. Petersburg,"" according to Noyan Tapan on June 7. Points Of Contention Two days earlier, the Azerbaijani online daily zerkalo.az quoted Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov as saying that of the eight ""basic principles"" for resolving the conflict that are on the table, and that were made public last year by the Minsk Group co-chairs only ""one or two"" are still the subject of major disagreement. After the St. Petersburg talks, both Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian admitted that the two sides failed to make progress, but declined to explain the reasons for that failure or to specify the nature of the remaining points of contention. But a diplomatic source close to the talks told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that the two presidents disagreed on the future status of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. That source said Aliyev insisted that that final status not be mentioned in the interim peace accord, while Armenia insists that accord provide for the holding of a referendum among the unrecognized republic's population. On June 20, speaking at a joint press conference in Yerevan with NATO's special representative for the South Caucasus, Robert Simmons, Oskanian implicitly blamed Azerbaijan for the lack of headway in St. Petersburg. ""Azerbaijan is showing clear signs of a change of position, a tendency to renege on some agreements,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service quoted Oskanian as saying. He added, however, that ""we have to wait and watch Azerbaijan's further steps to judge whether there is a toughening of its position or a broader policy change."" He further rejected as untrue claims by Azerbaijani First Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov that the reason the St. Petersburg talks failed to yield the hoped-for breakthrough was that Armenia asked for a time-out. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry responded with a statement, carried later on June 20 by day.az, accusing Oskanian of seeking to off-load the blame for the lack of progress in the talks, implying that Armenia itself was the obstacle. The statement further affirmed that Azerbaijan responded ""very constructively"" to the most recent proposals put forward by the co-chairs during their most recent tour of the region. (The French co-chair, Bernard Fassier, confirmed after the St. Petersburg talks that the co-chairs have proposed new approaches, but did not give any details.) Next Move? Given the confidentiality that surrounds the negotiating process, determining the seriousness of the remaining disagreements and the true reason for the lack of a ""breakthrough"" in St. Petersburg is difficult, if not impossible. Commentators on the Karabakh negotiating frequently tend to use interchangeably the terms ""time-out,"" ""standstill"" (which does not preclude the resumption of talks at any time); ""deadlock"" (which implies that both sides are either unable or unwilling to maneuver or make concessions); and ""stalemate"" (which in chess implies that one partner is at a mortal disadvantage, with the king able only to move into check). Which term is most appropriate to the current situation, only the negotiators and the mediators can say. Oskanian on June 20 explicitly rejected Azerbaijani claims that Armenia has taken a time-out. And the fact that the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry on June 20 reaffirmed its commitment to ""continuing talks on the basis of the co-chairs' most recent proposals"" suggests that the present hiatus reflects a standstill, rather than deadlock. Baku may, after all, simply be marking time and waiting for the outcome of next month's presidential election in Nagorno-Karabakh.",,,

Bush, during visits to Albania and Bulgaria, made his most definitive statements yet about the future status of the Serbian province of Kosovo. On a visit to Sofia today, Bush reiterated that ""America believes that Kosovo ought to be independent."" In Tirana on June 10, Bush said he does not support ""endless dialogue"" over Kosovo's future status. The U.S. president's comments, which left little room for misinterpretation, are reverberating not only in Belgrade and Pristina, but in other breakaway regions and so-called frozen-conflict zones -- Chechnya, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Transdniester. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly linked the Kosovo issue to the other frozen conflicts where Moscow exerts influence -- Transdniester, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. ""Outraged"" -- that's how Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reacted today to U.S. Bush's support for an independent Kosovo. In a statement broadcast on national television today, Kostunica said the United States is making a ""mistake"" with its ""one-sided support."" He said an independent Kosovo would present a ""new injustice and bullying that the Serb people would never forget."" Kostunica said ""America must find another way to show its affection and love for the Albanians, without offering them Serb territories."" Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic was more measured in his comments to reporters in Belgrade on June 10. ""If the UN resolution on Kosovo was now on the table at the UN Security Council, it's rather certain it would not get adequate support, i.e. it wouldn't be adopted,"" Jeremic said. ""Countries that are pushing for a resolution to be adopted soon are concerned about consequences if the plan is not approved. So we are entering a stage of huge uncertainty. Our position is -- let us continue negotiations on the future status of Kosovo, which is the way out from this stalemate."" 'A Very Clear Message' In Kosovo, Bush's statements were hailed as unequivocal support for statehood. In comments made to RFE/RL's South Slavic and Albanian Languages Service on June 10, following Bush's visit to Tirana, Kosovar Prime Minister Agim Ceku said Pristina had never doubted the engagement of the United States on the issue. ""President Bush gave a very clear message,"" Ceku said. ""In a way, he declared Kosovo's independence. I have some information from the meetings he held in Albania, and his message is very clear -- Kosovo's people need to stay calm, and the result of this process will be Kosovo's independence, as the only real and pragmatic solution. And the time for it is now. "" Kosovar President Fatmir Sejdiu said June 10 was a historic day for Kosovo, as well as for Albania, which saw the first visit by a sitting U.S. president. In Tirana, Sejdiu said, Bush summed up the view of Washington and its Western allies -- that Kosovo's independence is ""inevitable."" The head of Kosovo's opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo, Hashi Thaci, called on the United Nations to heed Bush's words and approve a resolution on Kosovo's independence ""as soon as possible."" A plan put forward by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari -- supported by the United States, but opposed by Russia -- would give Kosovo a form of internationally supervised independence. No Analogy? Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli, on a visit to RFE/RL's Prague broadcast center today, said the status of Kosovo cannot be compared with the situations in its breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ""I strongly believe that there is no possibility, no way, to draw these parallels and to repeat this precedent,"" he said. ""And I have no doubt that Abkhazia's and South Ossetia's conflicts are going to be resolved peacefully, in the framework of the territorial integrity of Georgia."" He said the future of Abkhazia can ""only be decided by the whole prewar population of Abkhazia, not only by those who have managed to ethnically cleanse the region and are claiming independence right now."" Putin's Position Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly linked the Kosovo issue to the other frozen conflicts where Moscow exerts influence -- Transdniester, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Chechen separatist envoy Akhmed Zakayev said he believes Putin doesn't want to be held responsible for a UN decision on Kosovo's future, but that once its status is decided, he will use it for his own ends. Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli speaking at RFE/RL in Prague today (RFE/RL)""Putin understands that in order to formalize legally the de facto annexation of these republics -- from Moldova to Georgia -- he needs precisely the Kosovo precedent, and he will get it,"" Zakaev told RFE/RL's North Caucasus Service from London today. Artyom Ulunyan is a professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Universal History in Moscow and an expert on Central Asia and the Balkans. In an interview today with RFE/RL's Russian Service, Ulunyan said 2007 appears to be Kosovo's year. He said the sooner a decision is made on Kosovo's final status, the better. ""This is quite a delicate issue that touches the ethnic feelings of many peoples who, in one way or another, are connected with the Kosovo issue,"" he said. ""But from the point of view of political realities, the question of Kosovo's independence requires an urgent resolution and any delay would have an impact on relations inside the region, relations among Europeans, Europe's relations with Russia, with the United States, and with the Balkans."" Vefa Guluzade is a political scientist in Azerbaijan and was an adviser to former President Heydar Aliyev. In an interview with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service today, he said no link can be made between independence for Kosovo and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. ""Nagorno-Karabakh is occupied by Armenians together with Russians,"" Guluzade said. ""It is aggression, and it must be stopped. That is why there is no similarity between Kosovo and Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Putin wants to use it against American actions in Kosovo, but he is wrong.""

What would the impact be on that volatile region -- a crossroads for the competing interests of Russia, the United States, and Iran -- if Washington accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to jointly use a Russian-leased radar base in Azerbaijan as part of an antimissile shield?In a word: profound. After all, Azerbaijan and Armenia, which fought a war in the early 1990s, are still locked in a bitter dispute.

""So probably in the next talks between President Mahmud Ahmadinejad and Baku officials, this is going to come up as a big concern.""Frozen ConflictThen there's Armenia and Azerbaijan, who fought a war in 1991-94 in which 25,000 died. They have since been locked in a bitter dispute over the object of that conflict: Azerbaijan's predominantly ethnic-Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh.Ironically, Putin's offer comes as Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian President Robert Kocharian, himself a former Karabakh leader, are to meet in St. Petersburg on June 9 to discuss the standoff over the enclave.International mediators have hoped that the two presidents can agree on small steps to improve life for people in Nagorno-Karabakh. But they also fear if dialogue fails, violence could resume, destabilizing an area that is emerging as a key energy producer and transport route between the Caspian Sea region and Europe. Putin's missile-defense proposal, however, appears to risk tipping the balancing act on Nagorno-Karabakh toward Azerbaijan.Upsetting Regional BalanceRasim Musabekov, a political analyst based in Baku, suggests Azerbaijan could parlay any pivotal role in Washington's missile-defense shield into obtaining concessions from Armenian in the standoff over Nagorno-Karabakh.""The discussion of this issue alone is raising Azerbaijan's strategic importance. This is a win for Azerbaijan. If we are taken as partners of the United States of America and Russia, this would give us certain security guarantees and would lead to obligations [on the part of Russia and the United States] to settle problems that Azerbaijan is concerned about,"" Musabekov says.

However, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov has told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service that Baku is ready to negotiate ""bilaterally, or we can do it in the trilateral format"" with the United States and Russia, which currently leases the radar base from Azerbaijan.Armenia, meanwhile, would appear to be concerned about that prospect.Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Karapetian tells RFE/RL that both Russia and the United States should ""take into account the balance of the power in the region before making such a decision.""Armenia NervousBut for weeks now, even before Putin made his surprise proposal at the Group of Eight (G8) summit in Germany, that balance has already appeared to be tilting away from Armenia.Yerevan is traditionally a close ally of Russia.

Russian high-level officials are frequently in Baku. You can see them almost every week in Baku, talking to Azeri leaders,"" he says. ""And this makes Armenian leaders nervous.

Participants say the ongoing talks between the HHK and its junior partner in government since 2003, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), focus not on the number of ministerial portfolios the HHD would receive, but on increasing its input into the formulation of government policy. But the real bone of contention may be whether the HHD is prepared to support Sarkisian's candidacy in the presidential election due early next year. Sarkisian may be reluctant to include the HHD in the new government without a binding pledge of support for his 2008 presidential bid. In his first public comments after the release of the preliminary election returns, Sarkisian told journalists in Yerevan on May 16 that ""the more political forces are included in the government, the more trusted that government will be."" He added, without elaboration, ""we are ready to cooperate with any political force, with any individual."" What Kind Of Coalition? Meeting with election observers one week later, he repeated that the HHK is ready ""to draw capable parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces into the government,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported.

Tentative talks on the composition of the new cabinet took place on May 18, according to the opposition newspaper ""Hayk"" that has ties to former President Levon Ter-Petrossian's Armenian Pan-National Movement. How many subsequent rounds of talks have taken place is unclear. Sarkisian told journalists on May 28 that ""negotiations are still going on"" with the HHD, which has 16 parliament mandates, and the Bargavach Hayastan (Prosperous Armenia, BH) party headed by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian, which is the second-largest parliament faction with 25 mandates. Two top HHD members, Armen Rustamian and Hrant Markarian, similarly told journalists after a two-hour meeting on May 30 with President Robert Kocharian that negotiations on forming a new government are continuing. Rustamian confirmed that ""we have not yet reached agreement on a number of issues."" Sticking Points Remain Media reports have generally attributed the delay in reaching agreement on the new cabinet on imputed disagreements over which party should obtain how many, and which, ministerial portfolios, with some analysts suggesting that the sticking point is the HHD's desire to increase the number of ministerial posts it controls, possibly by acquiring the defense portfolio. In the outgoing government, the HHD headed the ministries of Agriculture, Education, Health Care, and Social Welfare. Under the Armenian Constitution, however, it is the prerogative of the president, not the prime minister, to name the ministers of defense and foreign affairs. And some observers have pointed out that Russia is likely to object to the appointment as defense minister of anyone whose pro-Moscow credentials are perceived to be less than impeccable. Outgoing Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, who has served in that post since April 1998, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on May 28 that he has not yet received an invitation to join the new government. On May 23, Rustamian said the HHD received ""various kinds of offers"" of ministerial posts, but declined to be more specific. He said a decision would be made ""very soon."" One week later, on May 30, Rustamian denied that the disagreements between the HHK and the HHD center on specific ministerial posts. What is at issue, he said, is the HHD's ""new proposals and approaches"" to the functioning of the new government. In an interview the previous day with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Markarian similarly denied the HHD has already accepted an offer of three ministerial portfolios, and explained that the ""negotiations center on more important issues."" He said the HHD cannot be ""bribed by a few portfolios to join a government as an appendage,"" but will agree to enter a putative coalition only after ""ascertaining policies, rights, and responsibilities."" Markarian further denied explicitly that the HHD is insisting on naming the new defense minister. Looking Toward The Presidency But the most likely explanation for the protracted delay in forming a new government is Sarkisian's recent public confirmation that he intends to run for president in the ballot due in early 2008. The Armenian Constitution bars incumbent President Kocharian from seeking a third consecutive term. On May 29, Markarian said the HHD is reluctant to commit its members to supporting Sarkisian's candidacy, but he declined to say whether the party plans to field its own candidate. On May 30, Rustamian said that he and Markarian did not discuss the 2008 presidential ballot during their meeting with Kocharian, and that the HHD will nominate its own presidential candidate. ""That also means retaining our political independence,"" he said. ""That is the most important thing for any political force."" But Sarkisian, for his part, may be reluctant to include the HHD in the new government without a binding pledge of support for his presidential bid. BH has not yet made any public statement about joining the new government, while a member of the Zharangutiun (Heritage) party headed by U.S.-born former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian told Noyan Tapan on May 22 that the party has not yet been invited to join talks on forming a new cabinet.",,,

But the division of mandates raises questions about the composition of a new coalition government, which may hinge on the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun, a junior coalition partner since 2003. The May 12 vote was hailed by international election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as a ""clear improvement"" demonstrating ""progress"" compared with earlier ballots, and as largely meeting international standards for democratic elections. That evaluation both conveys a heightened degree of legitimacy on the new legislature and suggests a break with Armenia's dubious legacy of tainted elections. The election results largely confirmed general expectations, with Prime Minister Sarkisian's HHK the overall winner, followed by the new Bargavach Hayastan (Prosperous Armenia, BH) party and the HHD. Yet the election was not without some surprises. First, the scale of the HHK victory surpassed nearly all preelection estimates, while votes for Prosperous Armenia were surprisingly fewer than expected. The HHK garnered nearly one-third of the party-list vote, which together with the seats it won in single-mandate constituencies will ensure it 64 or 65 seats in the new 131-seat parliament, endowing the party with an outright majority. Bolstered by its strong position, the HHK now offers Prime Minister Sarkisian both a firm platform for dominating the legislative agenda of the new parliament and a strong position for his candidacy in the February 2008 presidential election. Prosperous, But Popular? Coming in a distant second, Prosperous Armenia polled a mere 14.7 percent of the vote, less than half that cast for the HHK, and which will translate into 25 or 26 parliamentary seats. That modest showing surprised many, as the party steadily acquired political standing and seeming popularity in the preelection period thanks primarily to the mass-scale distribution of ""charity"" and ""benevolent aid"" throughout the rural areas of Armenia by party founder and wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian. The party's poor showing underscores the extent of political apathy and cynicism in Armenia, marked by the ordinary voter's inclination to accept both bribes and promises prior to an election, but to ignore both once in the voting booth. Prosperous Armenia was established primarily to provide President Kocharian with the political power base he has never had before, rather than from any ideology or political platform. Yet even despite garnering fewer votes than it hoped for, and in stark contrast to its preelection boast of over 400,000 members nationwide, the election outcome does not necessarily mark Prosperous Armenia's premature eclipse. On the contrary, the results actually fulfill the party's stated primary goals -- simply to emerge as a new political force and to enter parliament. Tasked with a novel political role as more a pro-presidential than a pro-government party, the future of Prosperous Armenia will be closely aligned with that of Kocharian, whether he opts for a Boris Yeltsin model of secure presidential retirement or some Vladimir Putin-style political future. The third pro-establishment party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), the long-serving junior partner in the ruling coalition government, improved its position by securing 16 seats (compared with 11 in the outgoing parliament) and slightly more than 13 percent of the vote. But reflecting the intricacies of true parliamentary politics, the HHD has simultaneously emerged as a potential kingmaker in the new parliament, and as a broker in the formation of a new pro-government coalition in light of Sarkisian's stated preference for the broadest possible coalition, rather than relying on his parliamentary majority for a HHK-only government. Sarkisian's rationale is presumably that a broader coalition would expand support for his presidential bid next year, while at the same time preventing any potential alliance between the HHD and Prosperous Armenia that could pose a challenge to the HHK. Opposition Ranks Changing The election also resulted in significant shifts within the parliamentary opposition, notably the weakening of the opposition Orinats Yerkir party of former parliament Chairman Artur Baghdasarian. With less than 7 percent of the vote, the onetime member of the pro-government coalition will have only 10 deputies in the new parliament, but Baghdasarian has nonetheless made it clear that he intends to discard the opposition's traditional tactics of boycott and abstention, vowing to embark instead on a bold strategy of legislative confrontation. Second, if the sidelining of Orinats Yerkir was generally expected, the failure of longtime opposition leader Stepan Demirchian and his People's Party of Armenia (HZhK) to surmount the 5 percent threshold for returning to parliament was not. The failure of both Demirchian -- whom Kocharian defeated in presidential runoffs in 1998 and 2003 -- and his opposition party to win reelection, and the HZhK's dismal 1.7 percent of the party-list vote, may reflect his erstwhile supporters' unhappiness at his refusal to sacrifice his personal ambition for the sake of creating a unified opposition bloc. The third significant development was the emergence of a new dynamic political actor in the form of the Zharangutiun (Heritage) party of U.S.-born former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian. Official election results gave the party only 6 percent of the vote and a total of six parliament mandates, although many Armenians believe that the popular Hovannisian received a far greater number of votes, especially in Yerevan. The well-liked Hovannisian is hailed as a new opposition force, capable of injecting a new sense of optimism and integrity into Armenian politics. What's Ahead As the country's uncrowned new opposition leader, Hovannisian will most likely eclipse Baghdasarian in terms of both political prowess and popular appeal, thanks largely to his personal record. He is seen as untainted by corruption and, unlike Baghdasarian, free from the constraints of past association with the ruling elite. Most importantly, Hovannisian, who first moved to Armenia 16 years ago and served as its foreign minister in 1992, offers something new for Armenian politics, while still maintaining an established record of principled opposition and standing. He has waged a long battle with the Armenian authorities, beginning with the controversial rejection of his candidacy in the 2003 presidential election and culminating in the eviction of his party last year from the building housing its Yerevan headquarters. This dual record of political persecution and opposition has only endeared him to ordinary Armenians. In this reconfigured political landscape, the main players now face the task of forming first a new coalition, and then a cabinet. Here too, the HHD will exert its newfound political power, demanding not only the retention of its existing ministerial portfolios (agriculture, education and social welfare), but also seeking the defense minister position for one of its members, former Deputy Defense Minister General Artur Aghabekian. Aghabekian, a leading reformer within the Armenian military who served as deputy to Prime Minister Sarkisian during the latter's tenure as defense minister, may also bring a new vitality to the post now held by the retirement-aged Colonel General Mikheil Harutiunian. Still unclear is whether and how the reconfigured political landscape will impact the relationship -- and the rumored rivalry -- between Sarkisian and Kocharian. Over the medium term, politics will be driven by Sarkisian's clearly stated aspiration to succeed the outgoing president. But will Kocharian readily accept a passive role as a lame-duck president? Crucially, will Kocharian choose to ease Sarkisian's path to the presidency or to hinder it, possibly by backing a rival candidate?",,,

The outcome is likely to dictate the course of the country's presidential vote in 2008, and the West has pressed for tomorrow's vote to be free and fair. But with the Armenian opposition divided and Russia strongly supporting the current regime, a change of power in Yerevan looks unlikely. On May 9, a crowd of antigovernment protestors gathered in Yerevan and said if there was even a hint of fraud in the parliamentary vote, they would take to the streets in massive numbers.Activist Nikol Pashinian told the crowd that the protest -- which organizers said swelled as high as 15,000 people -- was a sign that the importance of the opposition was growing.""Victory does not come at once.

But we wish to see a clear improvement, and now Armenia should really demonstrate to the international community that they are able to conduct democratic and free and fair elections,"" Kamarainen said.The vote is not just a legislative election, but also a dress rehearsal for Armenia's presidential election next year. Presidential VotePresident Robert Kocharian is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Many observers say Kocharian and the Armenian ruling elite are trying to use the parliamentary elections to ensure that Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, who is Kocharian's close friend and political ally, wins the presidency in 2008.Aram Abraman, a political analyst and editor in chief of the daily ""Aravot,"" expects the party of power, the Republican Party, to win with a large majority, but with the assistance of falsification. Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian could run for president in 2008 (AFP) ""After this, their [the Republican Party's] leader, the current Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian will have the possibility to run for president. And in that election he will also win by a large margin,"" Abraman says.Sarkisian's ruling Republican Party enjoys a wide lead in public opinion polls. He also has the strong support of Russia, which has traditionally held a lot of influence over Armenian politics.Sarkisian, Kocharian, and other high-ranking officials say every effort will be made to ensure the vote conforms to European standards of fairness. Western skepticism about clean conduct of the vote has raised hackles in Yerevan and Moscow, which supports the current Armenian regime. The Kremlin says it is raising the number of CIS election observers traveling to Yerevan in an effort to counter what it considers to be bias among Western observers.OppositionThe closest competitor to Sarkisian's Republican Party is another pro-government party called Prosperous Armenia. Gagik Tsarukian, a wealthy tycoon and former world arm-wrestling champion, formed the party with Kocharian's blessing last year. Critics allege that the move was a ploy to siphon votes away from the opposition while maintaining an image of plurality. Prosperous Armenia has since been climbing steadily in the polls. Its popularity may be tied to media reports that Tsarukian's party is offering Armenians cash payments in exchange for agreeing to vote for the party. Armenia's opposition, meanwhile, has failed to unite around a single antigovernment party or platform. As a result, several opposition groups are all in competition for a shrinking pool of voters.""Aravot"" editor Abraman says the opposition also lacks a single leader -- like Georgia's Mikheil Saakashvili or Ukraine's Viktor Yushchenko -- that can rally the masses.According to opinion polls, the strongest opposition party is Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based State), led by former Parliamentary speaker Artur Baghdasarian. The opposition Heritage Party, led by U.S.-born former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian, also has a chance to win seats in parliament.Campaign CriticismOpposition leaders have complained that they have not had fair access to the media and that news coverage has been biased in favor of pro-government parties.Opposition leaders also accuse the government of using dirty tricks and intimidation during the campaign. Authorities on May 8 arrested former Foreign Minister and current opposition activist Aleksandr Arzumanian for alleged money laundering. The opposition says the arrest was politically motivated. Given this environment, Abraman says ironically he expects Saturday's vote to be marked by massive fraud, Western protests -- and little else.""Of course there will be declarations. The U.S. State Department, the Council of Europe, the European Union will announce that there was flagrant falsification, but that they hope the Armenian government will take steps to ensure that those responsible will be punished and that in 2008 the election will be more fair,"" Abraman says.""And then in 2008 they will say that they hope that those falsifiers [in the presidential vote] will be punished, and that in 2012 or 2013 [when the next parliamentary vote will be held] the election will be fairer.""But the United States says $235 million in aid to Armenia under the Millennium Challenge Fund could be threatened if the election is deemed unfair. Likewise, the European Union says a fair election is necessary for Armenia to continue participating in its European Neighborhood Policy program. As Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian puts it, if there is electoral fraud on May 12, the international community won't just say ""shame on you"" to Armenia. This time, Oskanian says, there will be ""negative economic consequences.""(RFE/RL's Armenian Service contributed to this report.)",,,

But both Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian and Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Karapetian immediately denied that Yerevan's negotiating position has changed in any way. Explaining his rationale for violating the unwritten agreement that details of the peace process should not be made public until all aspects are finalized, Aliyev claimed that the Armenian side has already violated that agreement by distorting the nature of the agreements reached to date, zerkalo.az reported on May 5.Aliyev said a ""general agreement"" has been reached on the Armenian withdrawal, which will take place step-by-step over a period of several years.But Aliyev's account of what has been agreed to differs considerably from the ""basic principles"" for resolving the conflict proposed to the conflict sides last year by the co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group, which since the summer of 1992 has sought to mediate a settlement. 'Basic Principles'Those ""basic principles"" were posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan in June 2006, and continue to serve as the nucleus for the ongoing peace talks.Aliyev said that Armenia has agreed both to the ""phased"" approach to resolving the conflict and to a withdrawal from the seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized republic of Nagorno-Karabakh that it has controlled since 1993, including the strategic Lacin corridor linking Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and the broader Kelbacar district located between the two entities. Aliyev said a ""general agreement"" has been reached on the Armenian withdrawal, which will take place step-by-step over a period of several years.At Armenia's insistence, Aliyev continued, Baku has dropped its opposition to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force, but the duration of that deployment will be limited. Once all seven districts are liberated, Aliyev continued, the Azerbaijani displaced persons will return to their abandoned homes, after which the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh vis-a-vis the central Azerbaijani government will be determined in a manner that preserves the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.He said that future status would encompass broader autonomy than the region had prior to 1988 as an autonomous oblast within the former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Those Armenians who want a greater degree of self-determination are free to leave Karabakh and resettle in Armenia, the daily echo-az.com quoted Aliyev as saying.Aliyev's claim that Armenia has agreed to the ""phased"" approach to resolving the conflict is at odds with the ""basic principles"" made public 10 months ago. Those principles point to a ""phased-package"" approach, meaning that the various elements of a settlement are all addressed and resolved in one comprehensive peace agreement, although not all implemented simultaneously. But the ""basic principles"" do indeed provide for the gradual redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh, with unspecified ""special modalities"" for the Kelbacar and Lacin districts. International peacekeepers would then be deployed on the demilitarized liberated territories. Finally, the ""basic principles"" stipulated that at some unspecified future date, a referendum among the population of the region would be held on the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Yerevan, however, has always insisted that the issue of Lacin and Kelbacar must be addressed separately from that of the other five occupied districts. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told journalists on June 29, 2006, that ""there will be a [Lacin] corridor linking Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia."" He added that Armenia will insist that that corridor ""has the same status"" as Karabakh.Possible ReferendumOskanian also explained that due to security considerations, Kelbacar can be returned to Azerbaijani control only after the referendum on Nagorno-Karabakh's future status. In a statement on June 26, 2006, pegged to the publication of the ""basic principles,"" the Armenian Foreign Ministry claimed that the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed on holding such a referendum. Azerbaijani soldiers in Karabakh in 1992 (AFP) The Karabakh leadership, however, has argued against any such plebiscite on the grounds that it would call into question the legality of referendum held on December 10, 1991, in which the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh voted overwhelmingly for independence from the then-Azerbaijan SSR, while the Azerbaijani minority boycotted the vote. Aliyev on May 4 made no reference to any future referendum. In Yerevan on May 4, Armenian Prime Minister Sarkisian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that ""I don't know what goals the president of Azerbaijan is pursuing, but it is known to everyone that we have principles and that those principles have not changed."" Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Karapetian for his part focused on Aliyev's implicit threat that after 10 years of fruitless peace talks, Azerbaijan would be justified in seeking to bring Nagorno-Karabakh back under its control by military force, and that thanks to the recent huge increases in its military spending, Azerbaijan's armed forces are capable of winning a new war. Karapetian construed that ""militant rhetoric"" as a reflection of weakness.Elections In ArmeniaThere are several possible, interrelated reasons why Aliyev should have chosen to sow confusion over the status and key points of the Karabakh peace talks just one week before the May 12 Armenian parliamentary elections. Many observers, both in Yerevan and abroad, believe that a victory in that ballot for Prime Minister Sarkisian's Republican Party of Armenia would pave the way for Sarkisian's election next year to succeed incumbent Robert Kocharian as president of Armenia. Kocharian's second term expires in March 2008, and he is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. (Aliyev's first presidential term expires in October 2008, but his reelection is considered a given.)Kocharian and Sarkisian were both born and raised in Karabakh and participated in the 1992-93 war. Sarkisian could thus be expected to continue unchanged the tough policy Kocharian has espoused for the past eight years regarding the timing of an Armenian withdrawal from the occupied districts and the future status of Karabakh. Aliyev may well have been hoping to compound the pressure on the Armenian leadership in the run-up to the ballot -- although it is by no means clear whether, in the unlikely event that the opposition launches mass protests at ballot rigging that evolve into a spontaneous revolution that topples the present Armenian leadership, the opposition would subsequently adopt a softer line on resolving the conflict. Alternatively, Aliyev may simply have been hoping to weaken the Kocharian leadership, whether or not as a prelude to launching a new military offensive.Moreover, Aliyev on May 4 described as a major diplomatic victory for Azerbaijan the recent double revision of the wording of the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights. According to the initial, and final, version of that report, ""Armenia continues to occupy the Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories."" The Armenian leadership protested that formulation, which was duly changed, but the initial wording was restored in late April after Baku pulled out of high-level security talks in Washington in protest. Aliyev may have been seeking to capitalize on that diplomatic victory.Speaking at Yerevan State University on April 27, President Kocharian referred to preparations under way for a meeting in St. Petersburg on June 10 between himself and President Aliyev to resume talks on resolving the Karabakh conflict, Noyan Tapan reported. Whether Aliyev's May 4 comments will torpedo those plans is not yet clear.",,,

Those four parties have issued a statement positively assessing Ghukasian's track record since his election as president in September 1998 to succeed Robert Kocharian, who was elected Armenian president in March 1998, regnum.ru reported on April 19. They further affirmed their readiness to back a single presidential candidate capable of tackling the problems the republic still faces; namely, achieving international recognition of the NKR as an independent sovereign state, rendering its leadership structure more democratic, and improving the socioeconomic and demographic situations. The joint statement did not, however, identify any specific candidate as meeting those requirements. And Artur Mosiyan, a leading member of the Karabakh HHD chapter, declined on April 20 to confirm to RFE/RL that his party will support Sahakian. Ballot Absentees In February, it was rumored that former Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Lieutenant General Artur Aghabekian would be the HHD candidate for Karabakh president, but Aghabekian subsequently registered as a party list candidate for the HHD in the May 12 Armenian parliamentary election. Boris Arushanian, chairman of the small extra-parliamentary Armenakan party, told journalists in Stepanakert on April 10 that his party will not nominate its own candidate as it has neither the resource nor the influence to do so, but will support a ""decent, strong-willed candidate with professional expertise"" and whose election program is most compatible with his party's goals, regnum.ru reported.

Armenians refer to this chapter in their history as genocide -- a term the Turks firmly reject. The issue has strained relations and closed the border between the two countries. RFE/RL's Armenian Service director Harry Tamrazian gives his perspectives on the issue. ""To be Armenian and not know what happened in 1915 is unimaginable. Every Armenian, wherever they are in the world, knows what happened to their ancestors at the beginning of the 20th century. And every Armenian knows that almost the entire Armenian population in Turkey was lost because of an extremist, ethnocentric policy carried out by the government of the Ottoman Empire in 1915. The issue will not go away. Armenians will not give up or compromise on their tragedy, which they firmly believe was a genocide. For the Armenian government, the fact that Turkey refuses to acknowledge the extent of the mass killings is disturbing. They still consider Turkey to be the biggest security threat for the country. Yerevan believes that that threat could be eliminated if Ankara recognizes the Armenian genocide. There have been hopeful signs in Turkey in recent months. More and more Turkish intellectuals and academics have come forward to publicly challenge their government's stance on the issue, some calling for open debate. Turkish writer and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk has been one of the most prominent and outspoken. He has said that over 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey and no one wants to talk about it. He was charged by the Turkish authorities for insulting Turkishness under Article 301 of the penal code, but the charges were subsequently dropped. Many hoped that things would change after the killing of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. Thousands of Turks took to the streets to express their anger, chanting 'We are all Hrant Dink, we are all Armenians.' Many saw the outpouring of emotion as a sign that the reconciliation process had begun. But the Turkish government has not capitalized on that historic moment. Article 301, which makes it illegal to criticize Turkishness or the Turkish government, still remains on the books. Opening up the Armenian-Turkish border could be the most positive and effective step toward reconciliation. Unfortunately Ankara still refuses to consider the move, despite pressure from Washington and Brussels. The border remains untouched, a relic of the Cold War.Armenians still hope that one day Turkey will recognize their tragedy. This year in Paris, Armenians and Turks jointly commemorated the anniversary of the genocide. More than two dozens French-Armenians and French-Turks laid flowers on the monument of the great Armenian composer Komitas, who, for many, has come to symbolize the suffering endured by the Armenians.""",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1076035.html,Armenia Pain And Sometimes Forgiveness ,"April 23, 2007 11:00 GMT",,,"April 23, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Even 92 years later, nearly all Armenians feel a strong connection to the events of 1915, whether through the memories of older relatives or by reading accounts of the event. Most are staunch in their conviction that the mass slaughter of their forbearers was genocide. But some are beginning to look beyond the devastating chapter in their history to a time when Turks and Armenians can bridge their deep divisions. RFE/RL's Armenian Service spoke to Yerevan residents about their views on Turkey, the recognition of genocide, and whether time can heal all wounds. Haykuhi Harutyunian, 25, linguist: ""When I hear the word genocide, it has a very deep personal impact, since every Armenian family has experienced it personally, through their ancestors. The pain is very personal for me, but I also accept it as a historical reality -- although I think we don't have to view it as something that's occured and we're simply victims. Such an approach is wrong for us now. It's high time to step forward and consider the issue from a slightly different standpoint. ""Perceptions have changed among young people. For example, if an Armenian and a Turk met 20 years ago, there would most probably be some hostility between them. But nowadays, young people in Armenia and Turkey are on quite good terms. I don't carry any hostility within me. I feel pain, but I have a feeling of immense forgiveness as well. I would really like it if we could replace their aggression and our sense of victimization with a brave step toward dialogue. I don't believe Turkey will recognize the genocide. And for me, as a citizen, mere recognition is not enough. It's not enough for them to say 'yes, it has occured.' There should be compensation for all the damage and losses as well. I want back everything that we lost."" Davit Gevorgian, 21, computer programmer: ""'Recognizing' genocide is an obscure concept. What does it mean to recognize genocide when it's already happened and we all know about it? What do we achieve when someone stands up and declares that he recognizes the genocide? Nothing. ""Turkey is under pressure from the European Union; it may or may not recognize it. If it does, that recognition will simply generation a feeling of satisfaction among a large number of people. Nothing more."" Svetlana Galoian, 45, accountant: ""I'd like the whole world to deal with this issue. Turkey should get down on its knees and ask forgiveness. Turkey has never asked forgiveness for all the blood that was spilled, and we don't have any reason to forgive them. Turkey will never admit its blame on its own; they'll only admit it under pressure from powerful countries. ""Of course, we know that recognizing the genocide won't bring back [Armenian composer and folklorist] Komitas [who witnessed the worst of the genocide] and [Armenian writer Grigor] Zohrap [who was killed during the genocide]. But at least Turkey's current generation will know that their ancestors were criminals and murderers. ""Time changes the situation. The power of the issue is fading, and I can't expect my grandchild will see it the way I do. I've heard so much about it that it seems to me I was there, but for my grandchild it surely won't be the same. For him, it will just seem like a movie."" Samson Hovhannisian, 93, historian: ""During the war in 1914, Turkish leaders planned the mass destruction of Armenians. They didn't want a single Armenian to remain in western Armenia; they wanted to own that land. ""The whole world has recognized the genocide, but Turkey still doesn't admit to it. Turkey is a lapdog for the United States, and it won't be able to take a single step without the U.S. Turkey won't admit to the genocide until [U.S. President George W.] Bush does. The day Bush accepts the genocide, Turkey will follow suit."" Stepan Avetisian, 24, lawyer: ""Genocide is the cruelest, most hideous act one human can perform against another. For me, the Armenian genocide is shameful, an indelible part of the history of our nation. It's an enormous sorrow, an aching wound that hasn't been cured. My ancestors came from Igdir [in eastern Turkey, at the border with Armenia], but they didn't experience the worst of the genocide and perhaps that's why I try to take a slightly more moderate stance on the issue. When you read the memoirs of people who lived through it or look at the pictures from that time, however, it's impossible to stay cool and detached. ""Recognition for me means respect. But the issue of recognition has always been taken advantage of and used for political purposes. I'm a bit conservative about Turkey; I don't think they'll admit to genocide. Even if they do admit to it, it won't change anything significantly. My father has a good saying: 'Turkey is a hyena, you should always keep the whip handy.' We should have a whip, in the form of a strong military, achievements in science and art. In other words, we should be powerful.""",,,

(epa) PRAGUE, April 23, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Armenians around the world are commemorating the 92nd anniversary of the mass killings and deportations of Armenians by Ottoman Turks. Armenians refer to this chapter in their history as genocide -- a term the Turks firmly reject. It's an issue that continues to blight relations between Armenia and Turkey. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations and the 268-kilometer border between the two countries has been closed since 1993. Armenians say that Turks killed up to 1.5 millions Armenians in 1915-18 as the Ottoman Empire was beginning to crumble. Turks say the killings were part of the wider conflict of World War I, and that only 300,000 Armenians died. Global Recognition Today, the controversy has gone global, with a number of countries debating whether the killings can be called genocide -- the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group. Many countries, including Russia, and Canada, have passed legislation recognizing the killings as genocide. 'I think we should live in the present, since there are more important issues, real issues, today.' In the United States, many members of Congress -- dominated by the opposition Democrats -- have voiced support for a bill to officially recognize the Armenian killings as genocide. The bill has met with stiff opposition from supporters of the presidential administration, which is eager to maintain smooth ties with its NATO ally Turkey. But even as the genocide debate has occupied international politics, some Armenians believe it's time for their country to move on. Davit Gevorgyan, a 21-year-old computer programmer from Yerevan, says he thinks that pushing the issue of genocide is no longer appropriate. ""We should remember everything that's happened, but we don't need to use that to create a certain political course. I think we should live in the present time, since there are more important issues, real issues, today,"" Gevorgyan says. ""It would be better to solve these than to devote all our energy and efforts to those old issues. Many politicians are using the Armenian genocide to create their political platform in Armenia and it serves as a trump card, a way to manipulate people. They simply abuse it."" Politically Charged But politicians in both countries aren't likely to shift toward a more moderate stance on the genocide issue in the months ahead. Armenia holds parliamentary elections in May; Turkey will have presidential and general elections this year. A dramatic policy switch on such an emotional issue could prove a massive political liability in a season when officials will be fighting to hold onto votes. Soner Cagaptay, who heads the Turkish research program of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, D.C., says that ""the public is as staunch, in some ways, on this issue and in their entrenched commitments, as the politicians are."" An Armenian woman mourns the death of a boy during the deportation (epa) Officially, Turkey has said that to establish diplomatic relations it would require Armenia to drop its policy on seeking recognition of the genocide internationally. However, some Turkish politicians have said that Turkey should not attach such preconditions to the opening of the border. That is mirrored by recent Armenian comments. Speaking at the OSCE in Vienna recently, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that in order to normalize relations with Turkey, the Armenian side has no preconditions and expects that Turkey should not have any either. What complicates the issue is the powerful and wealthy Armenian diaspora. The diaspora has huge lobbying power in the West, particularly in the United States. Cagaptay says that Armenia and the Armenian diaspora do not always have the same position. ""Armenia seems to be more pro-dialogue with Turkey -- unconditional dialogue, that is. Whereas the Armenian diaspora will not start a dialogue or a normalization of the relations unless Turkey unconditionally recognizes there is something called the Armenian genocide,"" Cagaptay says. Another complication in relations between the two countries is Nagorno-Karabakh, the ethnic Armenian enclave that Azerbaijan, Turkey's traditional ally, and Armenia fought over in the beginning of the 1990s. Business Links Despite the impasse, however, there are significant business links between the two countries. The border, while officially closed, is quite porous in places. Traders also travel from Armenia via Georgia to sell their goods in Turkey. Some Armenians labor as guest workers in eastern Turkey and there are regular flights between Yerevan and Istanbul. Many in the business community in Armenia and Turkey have lobbied for the border to be opened. They say it would have a huge effect in revitalizing poor regions on both sides of the border. Noyan Soyak from the Turkish-Armenian Business Development Council says trade has grown significantly, from $35 million in 1997 to well above $150 million now. ""The free flow of people, the free flow of commodities, would definitely have a great impact on the development of the region, of the economical development of the region,"" Soyak says. In the troubled relationships between Armenia and Turkey, there have occasionally been brief periods of hope for reconciliation. Turkey's earthquake in 1999 was one of them, when Armenians sent truckloads of aid. The murder of Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink in January 2007, when tens of thousands of Turks turned out for his funeral, was another. Turkey also recently completed a $1.5 million restoration of an ancient Armenian church located on an island on historic Lake Van in Turkey's eastern Anatolia region. Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called the reconstruction a ""positive"" message. But a better one, suggested Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian, would be to open the border.

(file photo) (RFE/RL) WASHINGTON, April 20, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- The human rights group Freedom House has praised the Bush administration for requesting a 17 percent increase in funding for programs that promote democracy around the world. But its report, ""Supporting Freedom's Advocates?"" also complains that Washington seems to be shifting its emphasis away from individual leaders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that promote democracy. RFE/RL correspondent Andrew F. Tully spoke with Amanda Abrams, Freedom House's director of communications, about this apparent shift. RFE/RL: If it were up to Freedom House, where would the U.S. government be focusing its efforts to support overseas democracies?Amanda Abrams: In repressive societies, and in those that are becoming increasingly repressive, the real way to attack what's going on is to support the NGOs and the human rights activists, because these folks are really the substance of the movement that can maybe reverse things.RFE/RL: How has the United States shifted its focus?Abrams: For example, they are working with the judiciary -- which of course is worthwhile -- working with legislatures, working with the legislative branch. So, sort of going more from the top down and looking more at governance issues. Which are certainly quite valid, but they're only part of the picture.RFE/RL: Your report expresses concern about the need for U.S. aid to individuals and NGOs in the former Soviet Union, particularly Russia. Can you elaborate?Abrams: It definitely seems that President [Vladimir] Putin has done -- is doing -- what he can to stifle independent voices. And there have been increasing restrictions -- particularly the NGO law and other activities -- so that even with [the presence of] opposition parties, there's been less and less freedom for opposition voices to be heard. This, we think, is really not combating the issue at all.RFE/RL: Does Freedom House have any other special concerns in the former Soviet Union?Abrams: In Uzbekistan, for example, Umida Niyazova is a journalist and human rights activist who's been in custody since mid-January. She's somebody who could get up to 30 years [in prison]. Her charges are illegal border crossing and possessing illegal literature, which is essentially Human Rights Watch documents, and another charge that's very similar. And basically she's just a human rights activist who's, we think, being targeted specifically for those activities. So, someone like her -- there are various things that she might need, and certainly before we even get to the point of someone like her being arrested, these folks need our support. And often that support is monetary or in resources.RFE/RL: Had the U.S. government supported Niyazova until now?Abrams: I think off and on. I know she [Niyazova] had worked with international human rights groups. I don't even know, frankly, if the infrastructure exists yet [in the U.S. government] to really reach out to human rights activists to the degree that we could and on, sometimes, an emergency basis. There are some funds that are there for working with human rights activists on an emergency basis, but often it may be limited just to legal defense funds. So if this [Niyazova case] was seen as important [to the U.S. government], we would want to see a lot more flexibility in some of the funding tools for these human rights defenders.RFE/RL: So far, we've focused on Freedom House's concerns about the proposed U.S. budget for promoting democracy. Are there any positive elements in the budget?Abrams: In a general sense, yes. We're seen an increase in democracy funding around the world, which is great, and we're also seeing increases in certain regions, but the former Soviet Union isn't one of the regions that's really receiving an increase, I'd say, generally speaking. Central Asia, for example, has been sort of overlooked and is generally going down [in terms of funding]. The Caucasus -- we're urging more funding in a general sense, not so much [for] Armenia, but [for] Azerbaijan and Georgia. Even Ukraine -- we're saying, ""Don't forget about it."" So each country has a different situation, but in a number of cases, either they're being seen, we think, as lost causes, like Uzbekistan, or political issues, like Russia, or already have graduated [viewed as already have graduated to democracy], like Georgia and Ukraine. And with those two, we don't think they have quite graduated yet, and they're not quite ready to be left alone.RFE/RL: Do you mean to say that the United States, in a way, is shifting its focus away from the former Soviet Union on human rights and democracy issues?Abrams: Perhaps. It seems they have done some reprioritizing. There's been increased democracy funding for Africa, and we very much congratulate that. But perhaps they've decided to consolidate a bit their funding and their programming to some of the countries that maybe matter more or that there's a better chance of affecting. So that may be, to some degree, why there's been a bit of a shift.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075967.html,Armenia Election Campaign Gets Off To Uneasy Start ,"April 19, 2007 15:02 GMT",,,"Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian might hold the key to the election (ITAR-TASS) APRIL 19, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Violence, harassment, recriminations, and international concern over perceived voter apathy have marred the first 10 days of campaigning for Armenia's May 12 parliamentary elections. Senior officials have repeatedly affirmed their determination to ensure a ""clean"" vote. But many commentators predict that the opposition's failure to align in a single -- or even several -- blocs will prevent it from beating two rival pro-establishment parties that benefit from virtually unlimited financial and administrative resources. Influential Figure Serzh Sarkisian, the powerful former defense minister who became prime minister and head of the ruling Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) following the untimely death last month of Andranik Markarian, is increasingly perceived to have the power to determine the outcome of the ballot. Asked on April 10 how many votes he thinks his People's Party will win, Tigran Karapetian responded: ""That is known only to God and Serzh Sarkisian,"" Noyan Tapan reported. A total of 24 parties and one electoral bloc succeeded in registering to contest the 90 (of 131) parliament mandates to be allocated under the proportional system, and 1,314 individual candidates registered in the remaining 41 single-mandate constituencies. The overwhelming majority -- 80 percent -- of outgoing parliamentarians are seeking reelection. But the opposition's inability to close ranks and create a single strong bloc is likely to limit dramatically its chances of success. The daily ""Zhamanak Yerevan"" calculated on April 14 that not a single one of the 20 opposition parties stands a chance of garnering the minimum 5 percent of the proportional vote required to win parliamentary representation. Even if each of those parties wins 4 percent of the vote, the paper pointed out, giving the opposition 80 percent, those votes would not translate into a single one of the 90 proportional mandates. There have already been several incidents of election-related violence. Even before the campaign officially began, police in Yerevan were forced to intervene on March 15 to end a brawl between supporters of the HHK and of the Prosperous Armenia (Bargavach Hayastan) party founded in late 2005 by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian. Two local Prosperous Armenia offices in Yerevan were rocked by explosions during the night of April 11-12, but no one was injured. As in previous parliamentary ballots, it is in the single-mandate constituencies where pressure on -- and discrimination against -- opposition candidates is crudest. In Echmiadzin, south of Yerevan, unidentified perpetrators opened fire on April 8 on a car belonging to a rival candidate to retired General Seyran Saroyan, who is supported by the HHK, while the election headquarters of a second rival were destroyed in an arson attack. Days later, a local court annulled the registration of both candidates after Saroyan filed a lawsuit alleging that they forged signatures submitted in support of their registration. Elsewhere, especially in rural areas, powerful local governors who are members of, or aligned with, the HHK are already being accused of intimidating opposition candidates or denying them the opportunity to meet with voters. Two opposition parties -- Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based State) , which is headed by former parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian and Zharangutiun, headed by U.S.-born former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian -- have complained that their activists have been refused permission to post campaign posters, Noyan Tapan reported on April 17. Up In The Air Adding to the widely held perception that the deck is stacked against smaller political parties are the provisions for media access. True, the election law allows each party registered to participate in the ballot a total of 60 minutes free airtime on Armenian Public Television and 120 minutes on state-run radio, with the option of purchasing a further 120 minutes of television and 180 minutes of radio airtime. But as ""Haykakan zhamanak"" noted on April 11, that free media access is divided into maximum two-minute segments, which makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to convey a clear, coherent, and memorable impression of a party's political program, given that even the most politically interested viewers are unlikely to make a point of watching several hours of election-related programming every single night for several weeks. And the prices set by Armenian Public Television for additional airtime are prohibitively high, as are those charged by its privately owned and overwhelmingly pro-establishment counterparts. Armenian Public Television announced in February it will charge 80,000 drams (approximately $225) per minute for election-related advertising (compared with $120 during the 2003 parliamentary election), while privately owned channels will charge up to 100,000 drams ($280) per minute. (The election law sets a cap of 60 million drams, or $160,000, on campaign spending.) Moreover, 18 of Armenia's 29 local television stations have decided not to air any campaign advertising at all. With ideological differences between the various parties almost totally eclipsed by their avowed determination to win, or hold on to, parliament seats, opposition politicians are apprehensive that some impoverished voters will avail themselves of the material benefits offered by Prosperous Armenia in return for a promise to vote for that party's candidate. During a visit to Aragatsotn Province on April 18, Orinats Yerkir Chairman Baghdasarian appealed to voters to reject the 10,000 drams ($27) he claimed they have been offered to vote for an unspecified rival party, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Alternatively, as in several previous national ballots, some voters may simply not bother to vote at all. Opposition candidates claimed at the time that official statistics showing that just over 50 percent of registered voters cast their ballots during the May 2003 parliamentary election were exaggerated, and the true figure was far lower. A delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that visited Yerevan last week registered in an April 13 statement its concern over the ""overall impression of a lack of popular interest in the election process by the electorate... Such attitudes of apathy, or even cynicism, are not conducive to the development of democracy in Armenia,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Such reservations, though cautiously phrased, may nonetheless have a greater impact on the May 12 election than similar warnings in the past. Since 1996, when key figures within the Armenian Pan-National Movement falsified the outcome of the presidential ballot to ensure the reelection of incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossian, international monitoring missions spearheaded by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have evaluated every single national ballot, whether presidential or parliamentary, as not meeting international standards for a free and fair election. Grave Consequences This time around, Armenia stands to forfeit funds allocated under the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account or to have its cooperation with the European Union within the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy curtailed, if the conduct of the ballot is deemed unsatisfactory. Cognizant of such possible negative repercussions, senior Armenian officials, including Prime Minister Sarkisian, have in recent months sought to convince international observers that this election will be different. Meeting on April 16 in Yerevan with long-term OSCE election observers, Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian said that his agency has set up special ""working groups"" headed by senior prosecutors that will react immediately to reports of serious irregularities during the vote, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Hovsepian also said he is taking ""all measures"" to preclude his subordinates' direct involvement in the election campaign. But speaking on April 18 at a press conference in Yerevan, Central Election Commission (KNH) Chairman Garegin Azarian said that to date, his commission has so far received 10 formal complaints from either parties or individual candidates, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. He said he considered that figure ""okay."" Meanwhile, the KNH is posting voter lists on its website in the hope of minimizing cases in which potential voters are unable to cast their ballots because they discover only on election day that their names do not figure on such lists. What percentage of voters, especially in remote rural areas, has Internet access enabling them to take advantage of that innovation is unclear, however. FURTHER READING Deja Vu Once Again?

In a report issued on April 18, the commission predicts that Azerbaijan will maintain at least 30 percent growth in 2007, to lead the world. It also notes rapid growth in Turkmenistan (14 percent) and Kazakhstan (10.5 percent). But the commission also warns that those economies are too reliant on revenues from fossil fuels and advises neighbors to seek ways to capitalize on the economic ""momentum"" of China, India, and Japan. The UN's Dutch director of Development Policy and Analysis, Robert Vos, joked at a briefing that his nationality makes him an expert on the ""Dutch disease."" The exception to high growth is Kyrgyzstan, where Vos says the economy expanded at a moderate 2.7 percent in 2006 after a decline the previous year. That term is a reference to problems that arise when revenues from natural resources put unhealthy pressure on manufacturing and other sectors. Vos noted that the fossil-fueled economies of Central Asia and the Caspian have little to worry about as long as crude-oil prices remain above $60 a barrel. But if not, he said, the threat of ""Dutch disease"" is greatest in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. ""What [Dutch disease] subsequently does is that [it] puts a stop on further diversification of their economies,"" Vos said. ""So if the oil prices, for instance, would go down in the coming years, they would have major problems in keeping up the economic growth and the living standards they have now -- because they haven't diversified sufficiently in other activities."" Watching Imbalances In Azerbaijan, the report notes that oil and petrochemicals accounted for more than three quarters (76.8 percent) of all export revenues in 2006. Its authors say the Azerbaijani and other governments are well aware of the threat of the ""Dutch disease"" and have undertaken tight monetary and fiscal policies -- along with other broad measures -- to address its symptoms. The report argues that Azerbaijan and Russia's preemptive measures have increased their immunity. But the situation is more precarious in Kazakhstan. The report warns that reliance on hydrocarbon resources has adversely affected the structure of Kazakhstan's economy. It notes disparities between the oil sector and just about everything else. Alternative Economic Fuel The commission says other economies in the region -- less reliant on hydrocarbons -- fared relatively well in 2006. Armenia's economy grew by 13.4 percent, owing mainly to a construction boom. Georgia's economic expansion continued with 7 percent growth. Uzbekistan posted 7.3 percent growth, and Tajikistan was not far behind at 7 percent. The exception to high growth is Kyrgyzstan, where Vos says the economy expanded at a moderate 2.7 percent in 2006 after a decline the previous year. ""What's happening in the Central Asian countries [is that] either they have very strong oil exports or [they have] very strong influxes of remittances (foreign earnings that citizens send to their home countries), particularly from those that work in the Russian Federation,"" Vos said. The report's authors caution that inflation is high, and rising, throughout Central Asia and the Caspian region -- with the exception of Armenia -- despite tight monetary policies. Armenia was able to contain inflation at 2.9 percent in 2006 through the government's willingness to allow the national currency, the dram, to appreciate against major Western currencies. The dram has appreciated more than 40 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of 2004, the report notes. That has hurt Armenia's exporters and its citizens who are dependant on cash sent from abroad. Women At A Disadvantage The UN commission also confront the issue of gender discrimination throughout Asia and its negative economic effects. It notes that female access to health services and education leaves women ""powerless intellectually, materially and politically."" Young journalists undergoing training in Almaty (RFE/RL file photo)But here it finds a silver lining for Central Asia and the Caspian region. Vos suggested that countries there are at least faring better in that regard than in some parts of Asia and the Pacific. ""In educational attainment, the countries in Central Asia are doing better than the countries in South Asia,"" Vos said. ""Generally -- in the inequality in health, but also in economic opportunities [and] the gender gap in economic participation and opportunities -- the countries in Central Asia score relatively better than many of the other countries in the region, particularly South Asia."" Looking Ahead The report offers a broadly positive forecast for the Asia-Pacific economies, although it expects a slowing compared with 2006 levels. Much of the ""momentum"" is expected to come from China, India, and Japan, the authors say. They suggest it is incumbent on the other countries in the Asian neighborhood to find ways to take advantage of the ""considerable opportunities"" that arise as a result. Azerbaijan is forecast to grow by 30 percent in 2007, with its main policy challenge lying in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Kazakhstan is expected to see 10 percent economic growth in 2007. The UN report warns that the continuing rise in GDP and steadily increasing inflation suggest that the economy may be ""overheating."" Turkmenistan's annual growth is forecast at around 8 percent in 2007-08, and inflation has already risen to double digits. To ease inflationary pressure and reduce risks of a downturn in fuel prices, the UN authors advise a moderate fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy. GDP growth in Armenia is expected to remain steady at 8 percent in 2007. The report forecasts continued improvement in the investment climate in Kyrgyzstan, with economic growth accelerating to 6 percent in 2007. But as the economy stabilizes and growth picks up, the report warns that inflation from Kyrgyz working abroad to feed families at home (in Kyrgyzstan) could rise. Uzbekistan's average annual GDP growth in 2007-08 is expected to be higher than in 2006, owing to favorable trends in global commodity prices -- particularly of its staple crop, cotton.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075951.html,South Caucasus Is Russia Losing Influence ,"April 19, 2007 09:11 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) April 19, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Moscow's influence in the South Caucasus region has been steadily waning in recent years. In a recent commentary in ""The Moscow Times,"" Thomas de Waal, the Caucasus editor at the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting, argued that the Kremlin -- preoccupied with Russia's resurgence as a world power -- is losing its grip on Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. RFE/RL's Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian services invited de Waal to participate in a roundtable discussion on the issue as part of their regular ""Caucasus Crossroads"" series. Also participating in the discussion were Ivliane Khaindrava, a lawmaker from Georgia's opposition Republican Party; Rauf Mirkadyrov, a columnist for Azerbaijan's ""Zerkalo"" newspaper; and Stepan Grigorian, the director of the Center for Globalization and Regional Cooperation in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. The discussion was moderated by RFE/RL's Andrei Babitsky.RFE/RL: To start, let's have Thomas de Waal explain the premise of his article.Thomas de Waal: My thesis is paradoxical. Of course, Russia is stronger politically and economically than it was 10 years ago. But as a result of its shortsighted policies, Russia is losing influence in the Caucasus. As a result of [Russia's] blockade [of Georgian wine and agricultural products], Georgia has opened its economy, its market, to other countries. In Azerbaijan, Gazprom's very shortsighted policies pushed Azerbaijan into a more pro-Western position. This is even happening in Armenia, whose position about the [Georgian] blockade was not taken into account, and where Georgians were able to hold a demonstration in front of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan about xenophobia in Russia. My thesis is that Russia's domestic and energy policies are dictating its foreign policy. And on all fronts, Russia is losing its position in the Caucasus.RFE/RL: How much is this thesis justified? Let's look first at Georgia. Ivliane Khaindrava: If we look at the way the Russian political establishment categorizes its priorities, Russia is losing Georgia and losing it at a very fast pace. If we look at the categories we're talking about -- military, political, Russian foreign-policy interests, the rules of the game in economics and energy -- then [Russia] is losing its influence. Accordingly, Georgia is becoming increasingly liberated [from Russia]. At the same time, if we are operating from a normal understanding of the 21st century, I don't think there is a particular problem. Georgia's economic space is open to Russian capital, and in the past years there have been projects with local and Russian investment. Georgia's information space is open. At home I can watch 12 Russian channels. On the other hand, there isn't really any particular reason why I would want to watch them. If Russia is prepared for close relations with a smaller and weaker Georgia, then there's no problem. But if Russia aspires to be a hegemon they will not succeed. Because for the Georgian political establishment, this question has been decided. We've decided that the days of speaking to us as Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov tried to speak to us -- saying that Russia will not allow Georgia to join NATO -- are over. We'll do everything we can so that you can't speak to us this way. RFE/RL: Is there a general sense that Russia is simply seeking to fill its pockets, instead of pursuing common interests and sympathetic ties with neighbors like Azerbaijan?Rauf Mirkadyrov: I don't think this is what has determined Russia's latest steps toward the countries of the South Caucasus, including Georgia. In recent years, there have undoubtedly been serious changes in Russia. It went from a state that had a financial crisis [in 1998] to one with the third- or fourth-largest gold and currency reserves in the world. This influences its policy, which has become more stringent. There are also other factors. At the end of the day, Russia could have continued to give favorable economic treatment to the countries of the South Caucasus. There is a country in the region that affirms Russian and Kremlin policy -- Armenia. But this favorable treatment didn't continue for the simple reason that one of the South Caucasus countries, Georgia, very quickly became uncontrollable. It defined its foreign-policy priorities as joining NATO and integrating with the European Union, if possible. Maybe some of Russia's actions made Georgia and the countries of the North Atlantic bloc act faster. It seems to me that Russia, since the end of last year, has sought to bind Azerbaijan to its side and pull it away from the West once and for all. To tie them to an anti-Georgian coalition and to themselves and pull them away from the West once and for all. To tie them to an anti-Georgian coalition and achieve a revanche. This didn't happen. Now I think there is a reevaluation of this policy -- particularly with the events surrounding Iran. RFE/RL: Russia has a very rich imperial tradition. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia didn't dictate to those on its territories how to behave. It raised the social standard. It brought the regional elite into its own. How do you explain the clumsy and insulting way that Russia is now trying to control the situation? Stepan Grigorian: I first want to say that, lately, we're always talking about Russia's economic growth, its large budget, its huge reserves. The question is: what's the quality of this growth? There is no quality there. This growth is only the result of rising gas and oil prices on world markets. Since Russia's economic growth is only a result of selling oil and gas, it strengthens corporations. Therefore, Russian policy today is not just the policy of the state toward the South Caucasus and the countries of the CIS, but also the policy of major corporations. Analogies are difficult to find in the Russian empire or even in the Soviet Union. Any corporate system works this way. They don't look at the political consequences of their actions. Therefore our country has suffered and is moving away from Russia. This is not just because of the political problems with Georgia, but also because Russia's closure of the [Verkhny Lars] crossing point between Armenia and Georgia automatically meant -- and Russia didn't even think about this, and high-ranking officials aren't interested -- that Armenia's ground communications were closed off. What does this mean? In the last half-year to year since that border crossing point was closed, Armenian businessmen began orienting themselves toward Western markets. So even in a place where the elite is not badly disposed toward Russia, they are reorienting themselves toward the West. The poorly conceived policies of Russia toward the South Caucasus -- including Armenia -- are causing the reorientation of the political elite. Russia grew a bit stronger financially -- not technologically, economically, or industrially, just financially. And now the Russian political elite seems to be under the impression that they can compete with the West and the United States for the South Caucasus. Russia's recent actions toward Georgia and Azerbaijan are connected to this illusion. But I think the movement of NATO, the EU, and the United States toward the South Caucasus will continue.RFE/RL: In the early years of Putin's presidency, a lot of political observers said his foreign policy appeared to be based on the principle of self-containment. Russia needed to be strengthened internally and reject ties with the outside world, including the near abroad. Could it be that Russia just doesn't need the South Caucasus, and that's why it's treating it this way? De Waal: Any politician in Russia who says they need to be friendly with the South Caucasus, of course, won't win any political points. I think the problem is that Russia doesn't understand the difference between the near and far abroad. The countries of the South Caucasus correctly see themselves as independent countries and are building relationships with the West, with Washington. Moscow hasn't sufficiently understood this yet. They still think: these are our neighbors, our former republics. They don't understand the finer points of the current foreign policies of these countries. Putin himself doesn't understand. Does he want [Russia] to be the successor of the Soviet Union or does he want to liberate [Russia] from the Soviet Union? RFE/RL: Thomas de Waal's commentary also talks about the problem of a serious cultural divide between Russia and the South Caucasus -- that in 10 or 15 years, the Russian language will no longer be spoken in the region. Does this seem realistic?Khaindrava: It's perfectly obvious that Russian culture -- not in terms of its existence, of course, but in terms of language -- is quickly losing its position in Georgia. It was once the obvious second language in Georgia, but that has already stopped being the case. The younger generation, including teenagers, are already going with English. As far as values go, things have also happened quickly. The Russian doctrine is an unclear conception of Eurasiaism. It is interesting to me whether Russian citizens even understand what that is. In Georgia, the most popular doctrine is Europeanism and the aspiration to affirm ourselves and our state as a faraway province, but nevertheless a province, of Europe. Russia is closer to Europe and there was once a sense that Georgia would get to Europe via Russia. But the process of disassociation [from Russia] happened very quickly. When the anti-Georgian campaign began in Russia, it was also an overall anti-Caucasus campaign, aimed against anyone with a Caucasian appearance. In Georgia -- even when Russia was seen as Georgia's biggest headache, even as everybody was saying Russia was Georgia's biggest problem -- there wasn't any xenophobia in Georgia. RFE/RL: Today a lot of people are hoping the Russian regime will change and become more democratic. If that proves the case, perhaps after the Russian presidential election in March 2008, could the countries of the South Caucasus envision Russia as a close political and cultural partner as they do with the West?Mirkadyrov: The situation in each country varies. Look at Azerbaijan. In the beginning of 2006, they were Russia's strategic partner. But in the end, Azerbaijan was talking about leaving the CIS. Russia was not acting like a friend and partner to Azerbaijan. Armenia has a different situation. It's more oriented toward its neighbors because their choices can override Armenia's choices. Armenia doesn't have a border with Russia. The choices of Georgia and Azerbaijan can override Armenia's foreign-policy choices. What about Azerbaijan? I completely agree that recent actions by Russia have scared away even the elite in Azerbaijan. They have begun to look at Russia as something dangerous. Its policy is oriented toward establishing, if not the former Soviet Union, then a of kind of empire where there is some freedom, but where [Russia] views the territory as its own. Russia looks at these countries as its own and this feeling has recently gotten stronger. This tendency isn't likely to reverse. Moreover, there's another strong tendency. That's the feeling that these countries need to change their foreign-policy orientations, work more closely with NATO and the EU, and in the future join these structures. Under these conditions, and in this political situation -- and also given the situation surrounding Iran -- I don't think the South Caucasus countries will move closer to Russia. RFE/RL: There are certain democratic criteria that countries must meet in order to be close to the West. Armenia and Azerbaijan, while not very far from this criteria, aren't very close to it either. If this doesn't happen, will these countries move back toward Russia?Grigorian: Thank you, that is an excellent question. I want to point out three factors which make it impossible to return to Russia's side. One is the quality of Russia's political elite -- and we need to remember that they are not politicians, but people from the special services, who have their specific world. Second, the unattractiveness of Russia -- the absence of democracy, the lack of technology and interesting scientific work. The third factor is more important as to why the South Caucasus are going to the West. It is the self-sufficiency of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, which are realizing very serious projects that will enable us to diversify oil and gas routes, transport, and the like. These things are pushing us to the side of the West. We have problems with democracy. Does this disturb things or not? I am certain that our political elite will change and become more democratic. RFE/RL: Thomas de Waal, you opened the debate and you should finish it. De Waal: I'm glad for the words of support from the South Caucasus. I would like to raise one question that Ivliane also raised, the question of the Russian language. This is a Russian resource that is dying in the South Caucasus. It is a language that unites three countries, that unites Abkhazia with Russia and Georgia. Russia is not utilizing this resource in the way that Britain utilizes its resource through the British Council. The Russian language has a lot of cultural significance and a lot of possibilities. And with this, Russia could have a very positive influence on the South Caucasus.

Targeting Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and regional heavyweights Russia and Turkey, the plan -- dubbed the ""Black Sea Synergy"" -- fits neatly into the bloc's existing framework of regional cooperation schemes. However, the European Union has ruled out contributing additional funds or setting up new institutions for the initiative. Seeking Unity Despite that roadblock, EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in unveiling the new venture today that she hopes it will help focus EU attention on the region -- and perhaps more importantly, help bring the countries in the region together. She said that enhanced direct contacts among the countries in the region will yield significant ""added value"" to their relationship with the European Union. The proposal states that regional cooperation will always remain ""complementary"" to already existing policies and agreements. ""The added value is, indeed, to have a greater focus on the region -- [that is] No. 1,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""No. 2 -- to have more cross-border projects. No. 3, I would say, via the dialogue between these countries to have more confidence -- and if you have confidence then I think you can also tackle difficult questions, more difficult questions, and I think that is the major thrust of it."" Ferrero-Waldner said she hopes EU member states will endorse the initiative during their June summit in Brussels. The Black Sea region has acquired greater importance to the EU following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the bloc. The new Black Sea Synergy initiative also targets eastern members of the EU Neighborhood Policy (ENP) -- Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, as well as nonmember regional heavyweights Russia and Turkey. Greece will also be directly involved. Direct access to the Black Sea is not a precondition for participation in the proposed scheme. The EU hopes to link to the existing Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) -- which includes all the countries mentioned above, along with Albania and Serbia. Ferrero-Waldner said the European Union envisages holding joint ministerial meetings with the BSEC, as well as separate talks with the five eastern ENP countries at the same occasions. Lots Of Issues She said regional cooperation with the Black Sea countries could encompass a wide range of issues. ""We [have] identified a huge number of tasks, let me just mention a few of them,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""For instance, developing a sustainable and ecological oil dimension to cooperation in the region. Then, a comprehensive regional dialogue on energy security -- again the regional aspect, as you see. Then, streamlining various transport cooperation activities."" The European Commission's proposal says that regional cooperation will always remain ""complementary"" to already existing policies and agreements. The proposal identifies human rights standards, democracy, and good governance as the top priorities. Ferrero-Waldner gave assurances today that the EU will continue pushing for concrete reforms through existing agreements, such as its cooperation agreement with Russia, the EU Neighborhood Policy action plans for the Caucasus countries and Ukraine and Moldova; and its association treaty with Turkey. 'Frozen' Priorities Similarly, although the Black Sea initiative identifies the region's ""frozen conflicts"" as one of its priorities, no new initiatives are planned. Instead, the EU hopes to build confidence among the countries involved by means of the increased regular contacts that enhanced regional cooperation is expected to bring with it.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075719.html,Armenia Prime Ministers Appointment Could Trigger Upheaval ,"April 05, 2007 14:30 GMT",,,"Serzh Sarkisian (NATO) April 5, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Over the last 10 days, Armenia's domestic landscape has shifted dramatically, with a series of developments that have greatly upset the political scene prior to the country's looming May 12 parliamentary elections. While such political change is neither especially new nor particularly surprising for Armenia, it has injected a new sense of tension and upheaval. These changes culminated on April 4, with Armenian President Robert Kocharian's appointment of long-time Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian to serve as the country's acting premier, following the sudden death from heart failure on March 25 of Andranik Markarian, who had served in that position since May 2000. MORE: Coverage of Armenia's upcoming elections: Pressure Mounts For 'Clean' Elections Parliamentary Ballot A New Twist On Deja Vu Although a temporary appointment, which expires with the election of a new parliament and the subsequent formation of a new cabinet, the move may end, or at least defer, the recent political upheaval sparked by Markarian's death. Yet it may be too little, too late, as Markarian's death has already altered the Armenian political landscape and upset the prior political balance between two rival pro-government parties. For the ruling political elite, Markarian's death could not have come at a worse time. Markarian was the fulcrum in Armenia's domestic political struggle both by virtue of his position within the ruling pro-government coalition and as the pivotal balance between two rival pro-government parties, his own Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), and the new-found power of the Bargavach Hayastan (BH, Prosperous Armenia) party headed by wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukian. Rumor Mill The sudden and unexpected nature of the premier's death also sparked confusion and rumor, ranging from the ever-present conspiracy theories around his ill-timed demise to public confusion among both officials and observers alike over claims that Sarkisian had already been appointed to fill the vacant post. Much of the confusion was reported in the newspaper ""Iravunk,"" which revealed that leaders of the governing Republican Party began discussing the question of who will be Armenia's next prime minister just hours after Markarian's death. The urgency of the crisis forced Sarkisian to hurry back to Armenia, abruptly canceling a visit to China and ordering his plane to turn around in mid-flight. And as ""Iravunk"" noted, ""the process went through several stages,"" with Sarkisian heading straight for the president's office upon landing in Yerevan. Party Control Having sensed the necessity for being present at such a critical time, Sarkisian's return enabled him to secure the backing of the ruling Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), which named him as its sole candidate to replace Markarian in a late-night meeting on April 2. The selection of Sarkisian, who assumed the number two spot within the party leadership last summer, virtually ensured his appointment as premier after an agreement was reached on March 26 in a meeting between Kocharian and the pro-government parties represented in the Armenian parliament that confirmed that the post would go to a candidate from the Republican Party. It also secured Sarkisian's control over the party and allowed him to assume full leadership, taking over the number one spot held by the late Markarian. Yet the appointment of Sarkisian as interim prime minister may spark a confrontation on two fronts. It will likely exacerbate existing tensions between BH and the HHK ""old guard"" led by Sarkisian. That conflict is centered on a jockeying for position prior to the 2008 presidential election as much as it is about garnering power in the new parliament. But it may also feature an internal confrontation within the Republican Party between the Sarkisian camp and the ranks of Markarian loyalists, emboldened by the outpouring of grief and popular support for the late premier. Presidential Bid But the real question is who will succeed incumbent President Kocharian, who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term when his current term expires in 2008. The president's assumed chosen successor, Sarkisian, has positioned himself fairly well, with a view to utilizing his position as the new leader of the dominant Republican Party (HHK) as his platform for a later presidential bid. Sarkisian's virtual ""takeover"" of the leadership of the HHK from the late prime minister in summer 2006 gave rise to tensions within that party, which were reportedly defused by a trade-off under which, following a HHK election victory, Markarian would have received the post of parliament speaker in return for ceding the premiership to Sarkisian. Now that the terms of that putative power-sharing agreement no longer apply, Armenia's current parliamentary speaker Tigran Torosian -- a veteran HHK member -- is in a much stronger position to retain his post after the election. Markarian's funeral on March 28 (Onnik Krikorian/Eurasia Net) Even before the May 12 election, Markarian's untimely death could impact on political stability in other ways. As the country's longest-serving prime minister, Markarian came to personify a mediating role within Armenia's traditionally cut-throat politics, conferring a degree of internal stability that set his tenure apart from that of his predecessors. It remains to be seen whether the junior coalition partner, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD), will inherit that role as a mediator between the two rival pro-government camps. At the same time, the new situation has presented new opportunities for Defense Minister Sarkisian. The new landscape allowed him to consolidate his personal power and authority within the HHK by either sidelining or co-opting the remaining Markarian loyalists. And the appointment also offers an early start to his effort to present himself publicly as a viable, if not necessarily popular, successor to Kocharian. While it may prove to have been a tactical mistake for Sarkisian to assume the position at this early stage, rather than after the elections, he may enhance his control over more of the administrative resources of the state. Nevertheless, his move has forced him to cede his ever-powerful role as defense minister, a critical position whose current vacancy only adds to the tension and upheaval. As interim premier, Sarkisian is likely to bolster his position in the face of the mounting pressure from his only real rival, BH. The power and appeal of that party, formed just over one year ago by Gagik Tsarukian, a wealthy businessman with close personal ties to Kocharian, has peaked, however. And although its claims of collecting more than 370,000 members, a startling figure that would be equal to roughly 10 percent of the total population of Armenia, has been matched by its growing popularity, the real lasting power of the party is actually limited by its mission. Despite expectations that the BH party will gain the second-largest number of parliament mandates after the HHK, its mission is limited to providing political support and a possible platform for outgoing President Kocharian and his closest associates. This suggests that any tension or instability from this rivalry will not carry over to the presidential election. But this also means that the coming weeks will pose a crucial test for the country, only compounded by pre-election tensions under the strain of intense scrutiny and higher expectations for clean elections. Most importantly, an end to the relative pre-election calm from the forging of a virtual power-sharing agreement among the country's competing elites also questions the promise of fair elections. On the one hand, Sarkisian now holds a premiership that makes him both more secure in terms of political positioning but also more vulnerable at the same time, having given up the powerful post of defense minister. This may actually push him to do everything he can to ensure improved elections, as it will be seen as much as a test of him and his leadership, and not just a test for the country. On the other hand, if attempts to adjust and adapt to this recent political upheaval fail or if conflict escalates, the contending elites may be even more tempted to resort to the irregularities and fraud that marred previous ballots. And this reveals a deeper deficiency in Armenian politics -- namely that the political system is far too dependent on individuals and lacks the institutions crucial for true democratic resilience and political stability.",,,

EU external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner plans to ask EU member states to speed up efforts to ease visa restrictions against the bloc's easternmost neighbors, and to open their markets to their goods. The hope is that the two measures would help the ENP meet it stated objective of facilitating economic integration and good relations with the enlarged EU's new neighbors. Tough Sell The commissioner intends to pitch her ideas during informal talks by EU foreign ministers from March 30-31 in Bremen, Germany. The plan will also be touted at the EU summit in June. Speaking in Brussels on March 29, Ferrero-Waldner acknowledged that neither idea is likely to be met with open arms by EU members -- with whom final decisions concerning the ENP rest. ""How can they feel closer to us if we keep them at [an] arm's length, so to speak, with complex and sometimes very expensive visa procedures?"" But Ferrero-Waldner argues that unless the EU opens up to its new neighbors, the bloc will fail in its efforts to improve its relations with them. ""Building better people-to-people contacts with our partners is in many ways, I would even say it's the litmus test for the Neighborhood Policy,"" she said. ""But the real issue is enabling our neighbors to engage with us more easily. How can they feel closer to us if we keep them at [an] arm's length, so to speak, with complex and sometimes very expensive visa procedures?"" ENP members Ukraine and Georgia are next in line to ink visa-facilitation agreements with the EU. Russia, which does not belong to the ENP, has already done so, adding some urgency to the equation. The other major element in Ferrero-Waldner's initiative to bring new life to ENP is to push for better market access for neighbors' goods. Improved trade, she says, should be at the heart of the new policy. ""The core of our strengthened ENP is, of course, improved access to the European Union's internal market,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""And our long-term vision is [that] of a 'Neighborhood Economic Community.'"" Free-Trade Future? Ferrero-Waldner expects the ENP to eventually develop into a free-trade area. For the time being, she argues, EU states should focus on dropping barriers to the products that are of greatest importance to the blocs neighbors. While acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue for some EU member states, she believes that the potential benefits ""far outweigh the problems."" The ENP countries in the Black Sea region (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan) are likely to be the first to benefit from the European Commission's attempts to strengthen the policy. On April 11, Ferrero-Waldner plans to unveil proposals for closer EU cooperation with those states, as well as Russia and Turkey -- which border the sea but do not belong to the ENP. EU officials say getting the two large regional powers to participate is seen as crucial by Brussels. At the Bremen meeting, the European Commission will also push other ENP-related proposals relating to supporting good governance, investment, and cooperation in the environmental end energy spheres. Next Stop: Central Asia Ferrero-Waldner says that the commission will also be looking beyond ""the immediate neighborhood"" to Central Asia. The commissioner was part of an EU delegation that held talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on March 28 with representatives of all five Central Asian countries. Current EU president Germany is working on the bloc's first comprehensive Central Asian strategy and is likely to borrow elements from the ENP.

One of his close associates, however, reiterated that Ter-Petrossian will participate in the presidential election due early next year. Popular Pan-National Ter-Petrossian received a prolonged standing ovation on March 25 when he walked into a conference room packed with hundreds of members of his Armenian Pan-National Movement (HHSh) gathered for its annual congress. HHSh Chairman Ararat Zurabian, who presided over the gathering, warmly welcomed Ter-Petrossian, saying that he will eventually return to power. ""I am convinced that Ter-Petrossian will definitely participate in the presidential election,"" Zurabian told reporters afterward. Zurabian said on March 25 that Ter-Petrossian can again win over Armenians with ""a few speeches."" Zurabian made a similar prediction five months ago, saying he believes Ter-Petrossian ""will definitely participate in the presidential elections as a candidate. That will completely change the situation in Armenia."" But on that occasion, Zurabian admitted that he was expressing a personal belief, and that he had not discussed with Ter-Petrossian the possibility that the former president would participate in the 2008 presidential poll. He added that the HHSh plans ""in any event"" to field a candidate in that ballot. Approached by RFE/RL on March 25, Ter-Petrossian declined either to corroborate or reject Zurabian's prediction. He vaguely promised to talk to journalists ""later"" before holding a separate meeting with HHSh leaders behind closed doors. Ter-Petrossian spearheaded the unofficial Karabakh Committee founded in early 1988 and was first elected president in September, 1991. In that capacity he led Armenia to independence from the Soviet Union. He was reelected in a fiercely fought and controversial election in September 1996, but has rarely spoken in public since he was pressured by key ministers, including then-Prime Minister Robert Kocharian, to resign in February 1998. The resignation came three months after the publication of a lengthy analysis in which Ter-Petrossian argued that Armenia should seek a solution to the Karabakh conflict sooner, rather than later. That argument was widely interpreted, and rejected, as a call for major concessions to Azerbaijan. Ter-Petrossian's divided and unpopular allies still hope that he will make a political comeback, and the constitution does not preclude him from participating in next year's elections: it says only that one person may not serve more than two consecutive terms. Haunting Past Zurabian said on March 25 that Ter-Petrossian can again win over Armenians with ""a few speeches."" He also claimed that the HHSh will win at least 10 percent of the vote if the May 12 parliamentary elections are free and fair. Many Armenians continue to associate the HHSh with the economic collapse and severe energy crisis of the early 1990s. Speakers at the HHSh congress sought to justify those hardships, saying that they were the inevitable result of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. They also emphasized the fact that the Armenian victory in the war was achieved during Ter-Petrossian's tenure as president. Zurabian went on to blame key members of the current government for the culture of electoral fraud that took root in Armenia under the HHSh. In particular, he implicated Defense Minister Serge Sarkisian and Minister for Local Government Hovik Abrahamian in the purported falsification of the results of the September 1996 presidential election.",,,

The mass resignation was swiftly accepted by President Robert Kocharian during an emergency government meeting chaired by the head of state. The action was in keeping with Article 55 of the Armenian Constitution, which obligates the ruling cabinet to step down in the event that the post of prime minister becomes vacant. Markarian, 55, died suddenly of a heart attack at his home on March 25. New Government On The Way A statement issued by the government said that Kocharian instructed all ministers to continue to perform their duties ""until the formation of a new government."" Under the recently amended constitution, the country's president should name a new prime minister, backed by the majority of parliament deputies, within 10 days. The appointment must follow consultations with leaders of the parliamentary majority. Kocharian held such consultations immediately after the cabinet session. The most likely candidate to replace Markarian is influential Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian, the No. 2 figure in the HHK's leadership. ""Participants of the meeting stressed the importance of ensuring the continued regular and unfettered work of the executive authority,"" the president's office said, without elaborating. Kocharian assured the majority leaders that he will take ""all necessary actions"" required by the constitution, the office said. The participants included top members of Markarian's Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), which has the largest faction in the National Assembly and is expected to demanded that the next prime minister be from the HHK. An HHK spokesman said today that the party would retain the post of prime minister. The most likely candidate for the post is influential Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian, the No. 2 figure in the party's leadership. He was increasingly regarded as the governing party's real top leader even before Markarian's death. A source in the presidential administration told RFE/RL that Kocharian has already decided to name Sarkisian prime minister. Kocharian's press service denied the information. Sarkisian cancelled a planned visit to China and rushed back to Yerevan from Moscow late on March 25. He visited the HHK headquarters in the city center at around midnight and left it several minutes later, refusing to speak to journalists. It was unclear whether he discussed the question of who should succeed Markarian with other members of the party's governing board. A Nation Mourns Meanwhile, a special state commission tasked with organizing Markarian's funeral announced that he will be laid to rest in Yerevan's Komitas Pantheon on March 28. In a separate decree, Kocharian declared that date a day of national mourning. ""We have lost a statesman, a colleague, a friend who...headed the government for nearly seven years,"" Kocharian told his ministers. ""And those seven years were the best years for our state."" Markarian came to power in 2000 during a politically tense period in Armenia following the October, 1999, armed attack on parliament that killed eight politicians, including Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian. ""It is very heavy blow to the state, to the people and to the party, because for many years Andranik Markarian was one of the pillars, and when there were difficulties he was the key man who could bring closer very distant positions,"" Tigran Torosian, speaker of the Armenian parliament and a leading member of the HHK, told RFE/RL.

But Saumya Mitra advised that the country needs to embark on ""second-generation reforms"" if it wants to sustain its success. Mitra's assessment came during a March 20 press conference in Yerevan, where he unveiled a study titled ""Armenia As A Caucasian Tiger. Sustainable Economic Growth Maintenance Policies."" Mitra reportedly explained that the term ""tiger"" -- an apparent reference to the four Asian tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan -- whose economies registered high growth rates and rapid industrialization from the early 1960s to the 1990s -- is currently applied to countries that have registered double-digit economic growth and a reduction in poverty for 10 successive years. Mitra described as ""impressive"" the fact that Armenia's growth is not based on oil or any one single resource, but has been ""fairly balanced."" At the same time, he stressed that in order to sustain that robust growth, the country needs to embark on ""second-generation"" structural and institutional reforms that would result in better governance, fair competition, and more developed financial services. ""Successful economies require conditions where any entrepreneur can enter a market and leave a market,"" he said. ""Here there are some formal and informal barriers -- some put up by oligarchs, some put up by political and economic interests -- that prevent level and fair competition. ""The [state] competition commission is weak and not able to enforce adequate competition rules,"" he added. Monopolized Wealth That some areas of economic activity in Armenia are effectively monopolized by wealthy businessmen close to the government is a widely recognized fact. That holds true, in particular, for lucrative imports of fuel, wheat, sugar, and other commodities. But Mitra made no mention of commodity imports, pointing instead to an equally serious lack of competition in civil aviation. He said the government has failed to liberalize it and is keeping air-transport prices artificially high in order to benefit the national airline, Armavia. ""Not many people realize that aviation services are actually quite expensive in Armenia, both for passengers and cargo freight,"" he said. ""This is the result of special privileges for Armavia...for which the consumers of Armenia pay but the shareholders of Armenia benefit."" The World Bank study blames the de facto aviation monopoly for the fact that freight shipped by air to and from the landlocked country, blockaded by two of its neighbors, fell by more than two-thirds between 1997 and 2003. Among other obstacles to Armenia's sustainable development identified by the study are the high cost and poor quality of telecommunications, as well as underdeveloped financial services such as bank lending and insurance. The World Bank economists also pointed to serious problems with rule of law and to widespread corruption in the Armenian tax and customs agencies.",,,

The Azerbaijani government fears that any decision granting independence to the Balkans' predominantly ethnic Albanian territory of Kosovo could set a precedent for Nagorno-Karabakh, which is located within Azerbaijan but has a mainly Armenian population. No Frozen Precedent Azimov spent much of his 45-minute address to the European Parliament's South Caucasus delegation explaining why Kosovo should not serve as a precedent for Nagorno-Karabakh. ""[The] Kosovo issue is different from [the] Azerbaijani issue, [the] Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict,"" Azimov said. ""In this conflict, we have an open territorial claim by Armenia [on] Azerbaijan. We have an open war [that] erupted in 1992; even earlier we had these military hostilities."" Azimov also argued that territorial solutions should reflect the views of all sides in a conflict. To do otherwise, he said, would undermine international law. Kosovo's final status has yet to be decided. A UN envoy, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, has presented a plan that would grant Kosovo internationally supervised independence. The EU has made clear it will not use a Kosovo resolution as a blueprint for any of the so-called frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union. But regardless of the final decision, the EU has made clear it will not use a Kosovo resolution as a blueprint for any of the so-called frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union. Brussels says Kosovo is a unique case because it alone is administered by the United Nations. Most EU officials, however, appear to be accepting the realization that it may only be a matter of time before Kosovo becomes fully independent -- and that other disputed regions may learn from its example. Hannes Swoboda, a senior Socialist European deputy, helped draft a parliament declaration on Kosovo. He told Azimov he accepts the Azerbaijani argument that the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh is different from that of Kosovo. But, he added, both cases are similar in the sense that it may be ""too late"" to return to pre-conflict conditions. It's a fact, he suggested, that all the governments involved should accept. ""I think Kosovo never will be part of Serbia again,"" Swoboda said. ""[That] time is over. And I wonder if it is not good for Serbia to concentrate on their own issues. And at the same time, [there] may be some parallel here for Nagorno-Karabakh. The question is not 'What is the legal point of view? What is your right?' The legal point is clear -- it's an occupied territory. But the question is what is the solution for the future that is good for Azerbaijan, Armenia, and the people in Nagorno-Karabakh?"" 'War Is Not Over' Azimov, for his part, steadfastly defended the determination of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev not to give up Nagorno-Karabakh. He said Armenia must allow Azeri refugees to return to the disputed enclave and the outlying occupied territories before talks on a resolution can hope to progress. The Azerbaijani deputy foreign minister also said Armenia may have technically ""won the battle"" that lead to the war's conclusion by cease-fire in 1994. But, he added, ""the war is not over"" -- even if Baku is not threatening military aggression, and prefers a negotiated solution. Azimov said Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart, Robert Kocharian, are planning to meet for talks on the issue soon after the May 12 parliamentary elections in Armenia. The Azerbaijani official also addressed an issue of growing significance for the EU -- energy. Acknowledging mounting alarm over the bloc's dependence on Russian gas and oil, Azimov promised his country would help the EU diversify its energy partners. Many European Parliament deputies attending today's meeting appealed to Azerbaijan to increase its support from the proposed Nabucco pipeline, which would deliver Azerbaijani gas via Turkey to Austria and beyond. Recent moves by Russia to create rival pipelines with Hungary and other EU countries have put Nabucco's future in doubt. Azimov assured his hosts that Baku's interest in Nabucco remained firm, and that the pipeline was ""not a dream."" But, he said, the EU itself must play a more assertive role in promoting energy transit from Central Asia across the Caspian Sea and onward via Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. ""We signed last year a memorandum on energy partnership with the EU,"" Azimov said. ""But I'm talking now about the further extension of this. It is not only between Azerbaijan and [the] EU. It is between Azerbaijan, [the] European consuming nations, [the] European transit nations, and Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan -- [the] trans-Caspian link."" Although most EU governments agree a common energy policy should be one of the bloc's main priorities, member states are still struggling for common ground.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075267.html,Armenia Pressure Mounts For Clean Elections ,"March 14, 2007 15:42 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) March 14, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Armenia's parliamentary elections, set for May 12, constitute an important test of the country's commitment to participatory democracy and political reform. They assume particular significance in light of Armenia's often troubled and tainted electoral record over the past decade. But these elections will also have broader implications, both for Armenia's relations with its neighbors, and for its wider foreign policy. To some extent, the election of a new Armenian parliament seems similar to previous ballots, with competition defined more by party rivalries among pro-government ruling elites than by any serious policy alternatives espoused by the country's fractured opposition.The May ballot differs significantly from previous elections in two keyrespects: scrutiny will be more intense, and expectations for a cleanvote -- both within Armenia and abroad -- are far higher.But the May ballot differs significantly from previous elections in two key respects: scrutiny will be more intense, and expectations for a clean vote -- both within Armenia and abroad -- are far higher. Consequently, the impact of this election on the trajectory of Armenian foreign policy, and by extension on the future of the country, will derive not so much from the composition of the new parliament as from the extent to which the election meets, or fails to meet, desired standards of fairness. Confronting IsolationIf the ballot proves to be only the latest in a series of flawed and tainted elections, the international response is likely to be both serious and swift. And in that case, the elections will go down in history not just as another lost opportunity for the development of real democracy in Armenia, but as a move toward further regional isolation.Armenia already has to contend with closed borders, trade embargoes, and exclusion from nearly all regional development projects, including the planned Kars-Akhalkalaki-Tbilisi-Baku rail link. Even with an impressive record of double-digit economic growth, Armenia still desperately needs greater connectivity and closer integration with the globalized marketplace.The May 12 elections will be the first national ballot since Armenia signed its Action Plan with the European Union, thereby officially committing itself to the European ""standards and values"" inherent in the new European Neighborhood Policy. Visiting Armenia in early March, EU Special Representative to the South Caucasus Peter Semneby openly warned Armenian officials that any problems with the election would be a ""lost opportunity"" for a ""firm relationship"" between Yerevan and Brussels. Such strong language suggests that seriously flawed elections could result in a setback to the country's evolving relationship with the EU, thereby undermining Armenia's position within the framework of the new EU plans for engagement in the region. International PressureArmenia would also be further outpaced in a region that already shows signs of division and disparity. Neighboring Georgia is already moving much faster and closer to Europe, while Azerbaijan by virtue of its Caspian hydrocarbon reserves is of increasing strategic interest to an EU that is seeking to reduce its dependence on Russian gas imports. EU envoy Semneby warned of a ""lost opportunity"" (RFE/RL file photo)Armenia's status as a beneficiary of the Millennium Challenge Account, a new U.S. foreign aid program that imposes important new prerequisites of democracy and electoral performance, could similarly be jeopardized if international observers rate the May 12 ballot as less than free, fair, transparent, and democratic. In that case, even Armenia's politically active diaspora would be hard-pressed to contain and overcome the ensuing damage to the country's relationship with the United States. Those ties are long-standing but cautious. Armenia has sought to avoid any expansion in ties that could be perceived as upsetting or threatening its deeper and more prized strategic relationship with Russia. Because of this, any deterioration in U.S.-Armenian ties would only be exacerbated by the already limited scope of their bilateral relations. The international community's higher expectations for a clean vote are defined both by the objective need for improvements in Armenia's tainted electoral record and by growing impatience over the far-too-gradual development of democracy in the country. The questionable constitutional referendum in late 2005, coming as it did after years of international assistance, has led to a new reassessment and questioning of the sincerity of the Armenian government's commitment to democracy. In this sense, the international community will no longer be as patient or passive in the face of yet another flawed election in Armenia.Regional SignificanceAt the same time, the international community itself also faces a degree of pressure and expectation. The international response to the Armenian elections will be watched intently, as the Armenian contest is only the first in a cycle of both parliamentary and presidential elections in all three South Caucasus states in 2007-08. Regardless of the outcome of the May 12 elections, there are likely to be few if any changes in current policies, including participation in the ongoing talks mediated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) over the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Armenian political elite has become far too entrenched, and has too much of a vested interest in the status quo, to risk disturbing the slumbering apathy of Armenian society. The real pivot for the Karabakh peace process may lie with next year's Azerbaijani presidential election. Although many consider the reelection of incumbent President Ilham Aliyev a foregone conclusion, there is some degree of optimism that with such a newfound degree of legitimacy, Aliyev may come to see a breakthrough on this ""frozen"" conflict as an appealing way to overcome the overbearing shadow of his late father and predecessor. Yet that optimism should be qualified by the acknowledgement that neither side has adequately prepared its population for a Karabakh peace deal that would entail substantive concessions.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075125.html,Armenia Parliamentary Ballot A New Twist On Deja Vu ,"March 07, 2007 15:38 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) March 7, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- In some respects, the Armenian parliamentary election scheduled for May 12 may prove to be very similar to the 2003 vote that returned to power the incumbent three-party coalition headed by Prime Minister Markarian's Republican Party of Armenia (HHK). Now, as then, policy differences between the various parties are largely irrelevant, with the main issue being whether the vote itself will prove free and fair. But in contrast to 2003, far more depends this time around on both the conduct and the outcome of the vote. Perception Challenge Continued receipt of funds under the U.S. Millennium Challenge program and medium-term cooperation with the EU are both contingent on the voting being perceived as free and fair. In addition, the political landscape has changed in recent years, reflecting the emergence of powerful new players, the shift of one former influential politician to the opposition, and the opposition's seeming inability to close ranks. Finally, the outcome of the ballot -- specifically which party gains a majority in the new legislature and who becomes prime minister -- will to a large extent shape the outcome of the presidential ballot in early 2008, in which incumbent President Robert Kocharian is barred by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. It is widely believed that the main competition will be not between pro-government forces and the opposition, but between two pro-Kocharian groupings. For months, opposition politicians have been predicting that, like earlier ballots, the May 12 election will be criticized by international monitors as not meeting generally accepted standards for a free, fair, and democratic vote. Two factors have served to fuel those misgivings. The first is the spectacular rise in popularity of a new party, Bargavach Hayastan (BH, Prosperous Armenia) formed just over one year ago by Gagik Tsarukian, a wealthy businessman with close personal ties to Kocharian. BH claims to have signed up 370,000 members, which is tantamount to over 10 percent of the country's total 3.22 million population. Its critics allege that its success is largely the result of the charitable activities undertaken by an eponymous foundation also headed by Tsarukian. A poll of 1,200 respondents conducted by the Armenian Sociological Association in November 2006 found that Tsarukian was by far the most popular person in Armenia. The second is President Kocharian's listing during a December 15 television interview of those parties that he believes will dominate the next parliament; namely the HHK, BH (on the basis of what he termed its ""simple and understandable slogans""), and the HHK's two current coalition partners, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun (HHD) and the United Labor Party (MAK) headed by businessman Gurgen Arsenian. President Kocharian affirmed in his televised New Year's address to the nation that ""I am sure that [the elections] will be up to the mark,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on January 3. ""Free and fair elections should be a priority for each of us,"" he added. Defense Minister Sergzh Sarkisian for his part similarly pledged on February 4 that both he personally and the Armenian authorities as a whole will make every effort to ensure that the elections are democratic, fair, and transparent, regnum.ru reported. Apprehensive Opposition But few opposition politicians place any trust in such assertions, and some even suspect that the international community does not consider it imperative that the election is fair. Artur Baghdasarian, who quit as parliament speaker in May 2006 after a public disagreement with Kocharian over whether Armenia should aspire to NATO membership, described the election campaign in an editorial published last month in the ""The Wall Street Journal"" as ""a crossroads,"" and argued that Armenia needs ""a strong and legitimate government supported by the people"" in order to implement the reforms on which political and economic progress is contingent. He called on the international community to support the OSCE election monitoring mission and thus undercut ""those abroad who might turn a blind eye"" to vote-rigging in the name of preserving stability. On March 5, Lieutenant General Manvel Grigorian, who heads Yerkrapah, the largest union of veterans of the Karabakh war, was even more outspoken, estimating the chances of election fraud as ""100 percent,"" given that ""there are lots of professionals around,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. He vowed to ""make every effort"" to minimize falsification in those single-mandate constituencies where the Yerkrapah will field candidates. The outcome of the May ballot could help determine who will replace President Robert Kocharian next year (epa)Manukian, one-time prime minister and defense minister and three times a presidential challenger, similarly commented in late January that ""only idiots"" believe that the May 12 vote will be free and fair. The Armenian press is, moreover, replete with speculation about imputed agreements already reached within the upper echelons of the present leadership on the allocation of the proportional vote. This time, a larger number of parliament mandates than ever before will be allocated under the proportional system: 90 of the total 131. By contrast, in 2003 the ratio was 75:56 and in 1999, the reverse, with 56 seats allocated under the proportional system and 75 in single-mandate constituencies. ""Hayk"" predicted on February 9 that BH will ""win"" 38 percent of the vote, the HHK 31 percent, the HHD 9 percent, and the opposition 8 percent. (Kocharian is said to be disappointed already in Arsenian's MAK.) Pro-Presidential Contest That scenario reflects the widely held conviction that the main competition will be not between pro-government forces and the opposition, but between two pro-Kocharian groupings, Tsarukian's BH and the HHK, within which Defense Minister Serge Sarkisian is poised to eclipse Markarian as the most powerful figure. Most pundits anticipate that, should the HHK emerge as the election winner, Sarkisian would become prime minister, with Markarian given the post of parliament speaker. Faced with the twin challenges posed by BH's capacity -- courtesy of Tsarukian's virtually unlimited financial resources -- to buy votes, and the imputed determination of the Armenian leadership to ensure victory for a party or parties loyal to the present leadership, the logical course of action would seem to have been for disparate opposition parties to subsume their differences and rivalries and align, if not in a united front, then in two or three blocs. (There is a precedent for doing so: several opposition parties aligned to back Manukian's presidential bid in September 1996.) One major putative alliance would have brought together Stepan Demirchian's People's Party of Armenia (HZhK), Manukian's National Democratic Union (AZhM), the Zharangutiun (Heritage) party of U.S.-born former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian, and the Hanrapetutiun (Republic) Party headed by another former premier, Aram Sargsian. (Earlier speculation that Sargsian would join forces with Artashes Geghamian's National Accord Party proved misplaced.) Some in the opposition question whether the international community values free and fair elections more than stability. However, on February 28 the leaders of those parties publicly admitted their failure to overcome their differences, without specifying the sticking points. Suren Sureniants of Hanrapetutiun told RFE/RL, without elaborating, on February 27 that the disagreements were not ideological, but tactical, while Sargsian implied to RFE/RL's Armenian Service the following day that he suspected some of his potential allies of colluding with the authorities. Baghdasarian's Orinats Yerkir was said at one point to be considering an alliance with Dashink, which is headed by the former commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh armed forces, General Samvel Babayan, but those expectations too proved misplaced. Moreover, not only did Armenia's most prominent opposition parties fail to cement a broad election alliance: the ""tactical"" differences that emerged between them dealt the coup de grace to the Artarutiun alliance of 12 opposition parties formed in the wake of the 2003 presidential elections, and which won 23 mandates in the parliamentary election later that same year. The leaders of its constituent parties pronounced Artarutiun defunct on March 2, but again declined to offer any explanation, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. According to some media reports, the remaining parties objected to Demirchian's insistence that his HZhK should nominate at least half the candidates on the bloc's joint list and that the bloc back him as its sole candidate in the 2008 presidential ballot. Parties Divided Consequently, a total of 27 separate political parties plus one bloc have formally announced their intention to compete for the 90 parliament mandates to be distributed under the proportional system. The sole major party that did not do so is Manukian's AZhM. Manukian, who is 61, told RFE/RL in a telephone interview on March 5 that since ""mechanisms for concealing vote falsification have become quite sophisticated,"" even a broad-based opposition alliance would have been hard-pressed to win a majority in the new parliament. In those circumstances, he continued, ""being a deputy of this and the next parliament is neither honorable, nor does it make any sense."" At the same time, he insisted that ""we are not quitting politics,"" and he made clear that he intends to nominate his candidacy in next year's presidential ballot. The one election bloc that will seek registration brings together two small parties sympathetic to former President Levon Ter-Petrossian, Democratic Homeland (headed by Petros Makeyan) and Mikael Hairapetian's Conservative Party. The former Ayl@ntranq (Alternative) now goes by the English name Impeachment and seeks to impeach President Kocharian (on what grounds is unclear: according to Article 57 of the constitution, the president can be impeached only for ""high treason"" or unspecified ""grave crimes.) Ayl@ntranq is reportedly attracting younger voters and defectors from both Zharangutiun and Manukian's AZhM. The various party lists number 1,497 candidates, with the HHK and BH each naming 112 candidates, the HHD 117, Orinats Yerkir 131, the HZhK 69, and Zharangutiun 56. A total of 173 candidates have been nominated to contest the remaining 41 parliament mandates, Noyan Tapan reported on March 5. Of the 131 outgoing parliament deputies, 80 percent have nominated themselves for the May 12 ballot either under the proportional or majoritarian system, or both, according to Noyan Tapan on March 7.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1075112.html,World US Official Discusses Rights Issues In Russia Caucasus ,"March 07, 2007 08:24 GMT",,,"Human rights activists in Azerbaijan conducting a hunger strike in November 2006 (Turan) WASHINGTON, March 7, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- The U.S. State Department has issued its annual report on human rights around the globe. RFE/RL correspondent Andrew Tully spoke with Jeff Krilla, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, about the report's conclusions in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the former Yugoslavia. RFE/RL: U.S. President George W. Bush often speaks highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin. How did Putin's Russia stand on human rights last year? Jeff Krilla: 2006 was a bad year for Russia in terms of human rights. One of the things we do in our human rights report is not only talk about the human rights conditions in each country on the planet, but we talk about trajectory. And unfortunately, when we talk about trajectory, one of the biggest backsliders we've seen -- certainly in terms of Europe -- has been Russia. And it's very disconcerting to those of us who follow human rights issues. We see government accountability to the people decreasing through a continued concentration of power in the Kremlin. We see increased restrictions on NGOs, declined media freedoms, and certainly the harassment and killing of journalists has been particularly troubling to those of us that continue to promote media freedoms as fundamental to any democratic society. RFE/RL: What about Russia's record in Chechnya -- and the record of those who oppose Russia there? Krilla: One of the things that we have done, as U.S. officials, has been to stress to Russian officials our support for a political rather than a military solution in Chechnya. We've urged an end to human rights abuses by all parties to the conflict, and accountability for abuses that occur and that have occurred. We've urged cooperation with the international community on humanitarian, economic, and stability issues. So we've worked very hard on the Chechnya issue and certainly met frequently with human rights NGOs to discuss the situation on the ground in Chechnya and to show support for their very hard work. RFE/RL: Westerners watched the 2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine with great optimism a little more than two years ago. How is Ukraine faring now? Krilla: One of the things that I do want to stress is that we have seen the situation in Ukraine improve. The fact that the March 2006 parliamentary elections were the most open and honest in Ukraine's history is a huge step forward for the country. And Ukraine has continued to show improvement in press freedom, freedom of association, and development of civil society. Pro-Moscow Chechen security forces caught on film abusing a civilian (courtesy photo)For those that would argue that the luster has worn off of the Orange Revolution, I would argue that a lot of the lasting effects of the Orange Revolution are in place and, in fact, have been consolidated. We're not in the business of picking winners and losers in terms of these elections. The fact that elections are up to internationally recognized standards is what's critical to us and to other democratic countries that work to promote human rights and democracy. RFE/RL: And what of Georgia? Krilla: Georgia's another country that we see having a very positive trajectory, although for all the improvement that we've seen recently, there are serious problems that remain in certain areas. There [are] reports of deaths due to excessive use of force by law enforcement officers, cases of torture and mistreatment of detainees, increased abuses of prisoners, overuse of pretrial detention, and certainly concerns about worsening conditions in detention facilities. But we still have seen a lot of progress, the last couple of years have been very positive in Georgia overall, but I think we continue -- in these human rights reports -- to focus on the conditions across the society, across all the institutions. And certainly I noted a number of areas that Georgia could show increased improvement that we're focused on, in our bilateral relations with the Georgians. RFE/RL: How is the human rights situation in Armenia, which has tilted more to Moscow than the West since the breakup of the Soviet Union? Krilla: We've got an election coming up in Armenia this year in April, but I think the human rights conditions continue to remain poor. There are credible reports that law enforcement officials engaged in arbitrary arrests [and] detention and abuse of detainees. There's a lot of concern, from our perspective, of rule-of-law issues in Armenia. And certainly media freedom is not what it could be. The government has restricted freedom of speech and the press, and I might even note -- through a very unusual move -- lawmakers rejected a government-sponsored bill that would have further restricted media activities. There is still an opposition, in that we see having some sort of force to try and keep the checks and balances in the government in place. But overall media freedom and rule-of-law issues are of concern to us. I will also add two other areas of concern. Religious freedom. Government and overall Armenian society continue to view minority religious groups with suspicion. Although they are allowed to operate, I think this is something that bears watching. And secondly, trafficking in persons. Trafficking in persons for purposes of sexual and labor exploitation continued to be a problem in 2006, although the government did pass legislation that toughened penalties for trafficking -- something else that bears attention, I think, in the future. RFE/RL: And what of Armenia's neighbor, Azerbaijan? Krilla: The human rights conditions in Azerbaijan remained poor in 2006. The government continued to imprison persons for politically motivated reasons, and restrictions on freedom of media, freedom of assembly and political participation worsened. Now, there were some improvements in the period leading up to the November 2005 parliamentary elections, but the May 13 partial reruns in 10 of the races in Azerbaijan failed to meet a number of international standards. So I think we're going to keep an eye on the situation there. Squalid conditions in a Georgian prison in March 2006 (Interpressnews)Our report is very comprehensive for the conditions in 2006, but certainly elections have been troubling in recent years in Azerbaijan. And we've seen restrictions on freedom of the press increase, and harassment and violence against journalists have continued. Freedom of assembly has been a problem in Azerbaijan. Restrictions on freedom of assembly have worsened, [the] government has often denied opposition parties' requests simply to hold political rallies. And then on the issues of religious freedom and trafficking in persons. Religious freedom issues: [the] government of Azerbaijan generally respected religious freedom but did restrict it for some Muslim groups on grounds that these groups were radical or fundamentalist -- something else that I think bears attention. And then in terms of trafficking in persons, I'd actually say this is a bright spot for the government of Azerbaijan. The government's taken several important steps to combat trafficking in persons, and I think we'd like to see that trend continue as well. RFE/RL: Finally the former Yugoslavia -- specifically Serbia. How has it fared since breaking with Montenegro? Krilla: I think we did note in our human rights report for 2006 that the government [of Serbia] generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but we did note numerous problems that persisted. Corruption in the police and the judiciary [was] a problem in 2006, there still continues to be inefficient and lengthy trials. There's been a failure to cooperate with the ICTY [International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia] in apprehending war crimes suspects. There's ongoing harassment of journalists, human rights workers, and others critical of the government, and we've seen arbitrary arrests and selective enforcement of the law for political purposes. Following the May 21 referendum of last year, we did see a very peaceful dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro, and I think the Serbians -- and the Montenegrins -- can be praised for that peaceful transition that we saw there.",,,

But Nikoloz Rurua, the deputy chairman of Georgia's parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, today told RFE/RL's Georgian Service that he personally believed it would be a valuable opportunity for his country. ""As you are well aware, there are three independent countries in the Caucasus,"" Rurua said. ""As for Georgia's position -- or, [to be more precise], my own personal position, for I cannot speak on behalf of the executive government -- I think it is possible to accept this proposal. In my view, the closer Georgia gets to Western defense systems, the more integrated it becomes in these spheres, the better it is for our country.""MORE: Coverage in Russian from RFE/RL's Russian Service.The U.S. InitiativeU.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Henry Obering, who heads the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, said March 1 that the United States is looking to base an antimissile radar in one of the South Caucasus countries.The proposal is likely to anger Russia, which has hotly criticized the United States for seeking to base other components of the defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic.Washington says the system is meant as defense against a possible missile attack from terrorists or rogue states.The plan has raised hackles in Moscow, which says a U.S. military buildup in the former Soviet sphere would be interpreted as aggression directed at Russia. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer says Russia may be worried that the United States intends to use its facilities not just for defensive, but offensive strikes as well.""There isn't any real threat to our strategic nuclear forces whatsoever,"" Felgenhauer said. ""Our military officials are expressing their fears that these missile silos that are going to be built in Poland could host not just antimissile systems in the future, but instead short-range offensive missiles as the silos will be made of concrete and it will be difficult to dismantle them. They are worried other types of missile-defense weapons may be deployed that in principle could have the capability of shooting down our ballistic missiles at takeoff.""Adequate ResponseRussia is reacting calmly to the latest U.S. proposal, which comes as the South Caucasus countries are -- to varying degrees -- breaking ties with Russia in favor of Western integration. Russian television showed Russia's Air Force commander, General Vladimir Mikhailov saying: ""We have everything needed to adequately respond to all these deployments. They have lots of cash. Let them spend it."" Russian military analyst Aleksandr Golts says Moscow isn't likely to remain sanguine for long.If we consider the generally phobic reactions from Russia to anything that has to do with the U.S. missile defense -- which is very convenient for all those who are engaged in propaganda saying that the Americans are surrounding us from every side -- I suspect that Russia's reaction will be very harsh and very quick,"" Golts said.Obering says a radar system in the Caucasus would be ""useful, but not essential."" He did not specify which country he sought to base the radar in. But observers suggest that it would likely go to either Azerbaijan or Georgia.Of the three South Caucasus countries, Armenia maintains the warmest ties with Russia.(RFE/RL's Armenian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, and Russian services contributed to this report.)",,,

Many of the 108 categories focus on the most popular Western music -- pop, hip-hop, rap, rock, rhythm and blues, jazz, and classical. But most traditional music from outside North America and Europe is grouped into a Western marketing category known as ""World Music."" Thus Central Asian ""maqam"" is competing in the same category as a South African gospel choir, classical Hindustani musicians, a Scandinavian-styled trio, and a live recording of Iranian and Armenian masters. It was September of 2003 when Iranian lute virtuoso Hossein Alizadeh teamed up with Armenian duduk master Djivan Gasparyan for a live outdoor concert at Tehran's Niavaran Palace. Persian And Armenian This year, a recording of that show is one of five Grammy Award nominees for ""Best Traditional World Music Album."" It is being marketed in the west under the title ""Endless Vision: Persian and Armenian Songs."" Alizadeh is a renowned composer and a master of the ""tar."" He also is a master of other traditional instruments in the Persian lute family. But ironically, the Tehran concert that earned him and Gasparyan a Grammy nomination was far from traditional. Instead of the Iranian tar, Alizadeh plays a new kind of Iranian lute called a ""shurangiz"" -- an instrument that he has helped design. Meanwhile, Alizadeh's collaborations with Gasparyan explore new artistic territory by blending classical Persian music and poetry with Armenian and Azeri melodies and lyrics sung by Gasparyan. Iranian lute virtuoso Hossein AlizadehTwo women -- Afsaneh Rasaei and Khourshid Biabani -- also sing as part of Alizadeh's otherwise all-male Hamavayan Ensemble. And Gasparyan adds his instrumental mastery on the duduk -- a cylindrical wooden flute made from the root of an apricot tree. Born in the the village of Solag near Yerevan, Gasparyan was honored in 1973 by the Armenian government with the title of ""People's Artist of Armenia."" But he is perhaps best known in the West for his performances on major motion-picture soundtracks like ""Gladiator"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Last Temptation of Christ."" Reviving 'Shashmaqam' Another Grammy nominee this year for ""Best Traditional World Music Album"" is a project that documents attempts by Tajik and Uzbek musicians to revive ""shashmaqam"" -- a style of court music that flourished centuries ago in Central Asia. The album is called ""Invisible Face Of The Beloved: Classical Music of the Tajiks and Uzbeks."" It is part of a project by the Agha Khan Music Initiative in Central Asia that has been distributed by the Smithsonian Folkways label. Documentary filmmaker and Central Asian music expert Simon Broughton says Shashmaqam is gaining popularity among Westerners. But he says listeners must be educated about the music to appreciate its depth. ""Within the Asian region, I think Central Asia is attracting some attention,"" Broughton says. ""They've got to work a little bit in bringing their music across. There are aspects of Central Asian music, like the Sashmaqam tradition -- the classical music tradition of Bukhara and Samarkand -- which is a very erudite tradition. It is one that you really do need to get accustomed to in order to find your way through it."" Educating Western listeners is exactly what the Grammy-nominated album attempts to do with its detailed, 44-page booklet and documentary film on a bonus DVD. The music on the album is performed by students from the Academy of Maqam in Dushanbe. Abduvali Abdurashidov, the school's founder and director, explains the history of the music. ""Maqam was performed at the court of the ruling emirs,"" Abdurashidov says. ""Generation after generation, for hundreds of years, it was transmitted from master to disciple. It went through many changes on the way to acquiring its present form. Maqam music doesn't have a composer. Its composer is the people."" 'Seeking To Achieve Truth' Abdurashidov says that when he opened the music academy in 2003, it was modeled on ideals of Islamic learning that are even older than Shashmaqam. Those standards make the study of music inseparable from the study of poetry, rhythmic verse, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. Academy of Maqam is trying to revive shashmaqam""Our maqams have a meaning that is mystical and Sufi,"" Abdurashidov says. ""Maqam seeks to achieve truth. This perfection is an aim. We have to go through hundreds of levels and difficulties to reach it. In a maqam, these levels are represented by various stages of musical development. It is like a person's movement toward spiritual perfection. A feeling that grows little by little toward a culmination. And it arrives at the 'awj' -- the highest culmination. It is a moment when the meaning of poetry and music arrives at a supreme point and bursts through to create a particular spiritual state."" The students at the academy have delved deeply into the relation between poetry and musical rhythm -- studying the tuning, the structure of maqam compositions, and the overall form of the song cycles. In this way, Abdurashidov says, the students are able to perform Sashmaqam in a way that hasn't been done since the 19th century. The three other albums nominated for ""Best Traditional World Music Album"" feature music from Asia, Africa, and Europe. ""Hambo In The Snow"" features a Washington-based trio that styles its performances after ancient Scandinavian music. ""Blessed"" is an album from South Africa performed by the Soweto Gospel Choir. ""Golden Strings of The Sarode"" is a collection of Hindustani classical music performed by Aashish Khan on Sarode and Zakir Hussain on tabla.",,,

The death toll was the highest since 1994, a year of conflicts in Rwanda, Algeria, and the former Yugoslavia. In its ""Freedom Of The Press Worldwide In 2007"" report released today the Paris-based group says 81 media staffers died in the course of their work last year -- 65 of them in Iraq. RFE/RL correspondent Eugen Tomiuc talked to Elsa Vidal, from RSF's European and post-Soviet countries desk about the situation in Central Asia, Russia, Belarus, and the South Caucasus. RFE/RL: Your report says the situation has not improved in 2006 in Central Asia. It cites Uzbekistan for maintaining pressure on independent local and foreign media, and says the Kazakh government has stepped up legal harassment of opposition media. But it singles out Turkmenistan as having ""the world's worst press freedom record along with North Korea."" Could you outline the general situation of media freedom in Central Asia? For regular news and analysis on media issues throughout RFE/RL's broadcast area by e-mail, subscribe to ""RFE/RL Media Matters."" Elza Vidal: Our most worrying topic in Central Asia is definitely Turkmenistan. Since [President Saparmurat] Niazov's death [in December 2006], we hope for a liberalization of the regime with the upcoming election [on February 19], but until now, there haven't been any concrete steps taken in that direction. We lost one journalist last year in Turkmenistan [RFE/RL correspondent Ogulsapar Muradova, who died in prison in September 2006], but we also have got no news from two other colleagues of Ogulsapar Muradova who were arrested and convicted in the same trial last August. As we have no news from them we are pretty worried and fearing that the worst has happened to them. RFE/RL: How about Uzbekistan? Vidal: In Uzbekistan we have seen the disappearance of almost all foreign media on Uzbek soil, and we know that most of the human rights defenders are forced to work clandestinely. Very recently, we have also learned about the arrest of an opposition journalist, a prominent journalist [Umida] Niyazova, and it's unfortunately not the first -- and we are quite convinced that it won't be the last, to be arrested under false reasons. RFE/RL: Your report calls the situation in Russia ""grim,"" and highlights the killing of journalist Anna Politkovskaya. It also says that in Belarus, more pressure was put on media outlets offering a voice to, or even mentioning the existence of, the political opposition. How much worse is the situation in these countries compared to previous years? Vidal: What we have seen in Russia and Belarus is a tightening grip on the administrative and financial means of media control. Of course, there has also been a burst of violence in Russia against journalists -- three of them were murdered last year, including, of course, Anna Politkovskaya. But in Russia we are most worried about the spreading of violence in all society -- a trend that affects also the security of journalists. But [both] in Belarus and in Russia, we have seen last year an attempt to get firm control on the all the means of production and distribution of newspapers and of all the free press. RFE/RL: In the Caucasus, your report singles out Azerbaijan, where it says that 2006 was a ""dark year"" for the media. Could you explain why? Vidal: The main problems [in the Caucasus] are, from our point of view, in Azerbaijan. Although the country experiences a real economic boom, we know that in Azerbaijan this tremendous growth doesn't benefit the free press, and there has been a real temptation on the side of [President Ilham] Aliyev to silence the opposition and the press that is linked to this opposition. But what we want to underline in Azerbaijan is also that there is a growing use of abduction and aggression against journalists that are mainly investigating corruption cases. RFE/RL: How about neighboring Armenia? Vidal: Armenia is far less violent for journalists compared with Azerbaijan, and the problems that we have witnessed are much more linked to the difficulty for some journalists to raise geopolitical problems, so it is much more a problem of censorship. It is worrying, but compared with Azerbaijan, it is really not on the same level.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1074236.html,Council Of Europe Armenians Azerbaijanis Taking Governments To Court ,"January 23, 2007 15:41 GMT",,,"Sardar Calaloglu (file photo) (Turan) January 23, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- At first glance, it might seem surprising that so many people across the former Soviet Union have come to regard an overburdened court based in a provincial French town as their only hope for justice. But the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is taking on an increasing number of cases, and handing down a number of verdicts holding national authorities to account. The court in January has delivered two landmark rulings against the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In October 2003, masked police officers in the Azerbaijani capital Baku burst into the home of Sardar Calaloglu (aka Jalaloglu), a leading opposition figure. Calaloglu was arrested in connection with a street rally held two days earlier to protest presidential election results handing Ilham Aliyev -- the son of the outgoing president, Heydar Aliyev -- an easy win. The protest had turned violent and left one dead. Violent Repercussions While in police custody, Calaloglu says he was beaten with truncheons, tortured, and threatened with rape. A medical report confirmed he had been repeatedly hit with a hard, blunt object. He was left temporarily disabled. Although Calaloglu was not present at the protest rally, an Azerbaijani court sentenced him to three years in prison on charges of ""organizing public disorder."" He was released early by presidential pardon. But Calaloglu was determined to seek redress. Calaloglu says he was beaten with truncheons, tortured, and threatened with rape while in police custody. On January 11, more than three years after his ordeal, the European Court of Human Rights found Azerbaijani authorities guilty of mistreating Jalaloglu and failing to adequately investigate his complaints of ill-treatment. The court awarded Calaloglu 11,817 euros ($15,275) in damages and expenses. It was only the second time the Strasbourg court had handed down a decision against Azerbaijan. But Calaloglu said he hopes the cases will jump-start the fight against officially sanctioned torture in his country. ""This is actually the first case proving that torture takes place in Azerbaijani detention centers,"" Calaloglu told RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service. ""This creates a precedent. Now all complaints about torture in Azerbaijan will be considered more quickly and more seriously. This proves that torture is a method commonly used by Azerbaijani law-enforcement organs."" Calaloglu is not the only Azerbaijani to turn to the European Court of Human Rights. In fact, more than 600 applications for potential cases against Azerbaijan are currently pending in Strasbourg. The court, which has been functioning in its current form for nearly a decade, was created to systematize the way human rights complaints are brought against states parties to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1950. The court has 46 judges, each representing -- although not necessarily from -- an individual member-state of the Council of Europe. It's a modest number, considering that each year the court can face as many as 50,000 applications for potential cases ranging from libel and antiterrorism issues to police abuse and illegal detention. Only a fraction of those applications will end in hearings, but the process of elimination is so time-consuming that it can be many years before some cases are finally heard. Wealth Of Cases Many of those applications are coming from countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States that are now members of the Council of Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia). Olga Vishnyovskaya, a Russian lawyer at the court, says this is largely the result of failed judicial systems in former Soviet states. ""Nearly all applicants who turn to the court say there is no efficient means to defend their rights within the country,"" Vishnyovskaya said. ""Many of the applicants feel so much distrust toward Russian authorities that they don't even file a case with them before filing it with us."" Russia files the most complaints with the human rights court, but the others have substantially boosted the number of applications to the court. In 2006, Georgia had 112, Moldova 641, and Ukraine 4,146. ""The main purpose of my application was to show our judges and leaders that they must honor their obligations to the Council of Europe."" -- Armenian opposition figure Mkrtchyan Strasbourg is also receiving a steady stream of complaints from Armenia, with 250 applications lodged last year. That number is expected to swell even further following the court's first-ever judgment, handed down January 11, against the Armenian authorities. The court ruled that Armenian authorities violated the principle of freedom of assembly by arresting Armen Mkrtchyan, a former member of the country's opposition Republic Party. Armenian Precedent Mkrtchyan was detained in May 2002 during a street rally organized by his party. A Yerevan court later sentenced him to a small fine. Mkrtchyan says his legal victory sets an important precedent for Armenia. ""The main purpose of my application was to show our judges and leaders that they must honor their obligations to the Council of Europe,"" Mkrtchyan told RFE/RL's Armenian Service. ""They will now be more cautious. One could say that I've paved the way for similar legal challenges against violations committed in our country.""",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1074207.html,ArmeniaTurkey Journalists Killing Dampens Optimism Of Breakthrough ,"January 22, 2007 13:40 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) January 22, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- For decades, the month of April has been a time for grieving by Armenians and their diaspora, with routine commemorations marking the onset of the mass killings of Armenians in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. But following the January 19 assassination in Istanbul of prominent Turkish-Armenian writer and editor Hrant Dink, January too has assumed significance. Death Of Opportunity The death of the 53-year-old Dink, who was gunned down on the steps of the editorial office of his newspaper ""Agos,"" is more than simply a tragic killing. Its significance lies, first, in its timing. The killing coincided with a new sense of optimism, as a significant segment of opinion on both the Turkish and Armenian sides appeared to be poised for a breakthrough in the diplomatic deadlock between Ankara and Yerevan. This most recent initiative included a new consideration of measures aimed at easing Turkey's longstanding closure of its borders with Armenia and seeking to move each country closer to formal diplomatic relations. Ironically, there has been a new impetus for reconsidering possible trade relations with Armenia among the most unlikely of circles -- the senior Turkish military leadership. That impetus has stemmed, first, from a realization in Ankara that the blockade and embargo imposed on Armenia in 1993 in order both to demonstrate solidarity with Azerbaijan and to pressure the Armenian government over Nagorno-Karabakh have failed. The slow pace of negotiations on finding a resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has limited Turkish policy. Moreover, there was a related recognition that Turkish foreign policy has become far too limited and hostage to Azerbaijan, with little room for innovation and even less for Ankara to seek new policy options. Those limitations on Turkish policy were further enhanced by the stalemate in mediation talks aimed at negotiating a resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. That stalemate compounded mounting Turkish frustration over the burden of subordinating its strategic approach to the region to serving Azerbaijani interests, rather than to meeting Turkish needs. Additionally, this impetus came in response to the twin threats posed by the rise of a Kurdish proto-state in northern Iraq and a resurgence of Kurdish nationalism in the eastern regions of Turkey. Thus, opening the Turkish border with Armenia was seen as an effective way to stabilize and economically develop the Kurdish-populated areas along the Turkish-Armenian border. And given the long-stated Armenian offer of normal diplomatic relations without preconditions, there was a convergence of interests between Turkish military and commercial interests, with each sensing an advantage in forging economic ties with Armenia. Forward Thinking The killing of Dink is also significant in that it reflects a much deeper struggle under way in Turkey today that reflects a dynamic reassessment of both Turkish identity and Turkish secularism. Moreover, the past few years have seen profound shifts in public opinion in Turkey as debate and discourse have become polarizedby conflicting visions of Turkey's strategic orientation. Within this deeper context of internal change, Dink played an important role in contributing to the debate about Turkey's future orientation.As a strong advocate of Turkish membership in the European Union, Dink represented the Western-looking segment of the Turkish political and intellectual elite. Dink's death has Armenians mourning (epa)As with the bilingual nature of the Armenian and Turkish newspaper that he edited, Dink personified the duality of Turkish identity -- seeing himself as much Turkish as Armenian and declaring his commitment to improving relations between Turks and Armenians. Dink once broke down during an interview with AP, decrying what he termed as the hatred that some Turks held for him, adding that he could not stay in a country where he was unwanted. Dink's life as a Turkish citizen reveals as much about the internal changes taking place in Turkey today as does his death. In this respect, the murder of Dink was more than simply a fatal attack on an ethnic Armenian: it was the killing of a prominent Turkish citizen. And Dink's life as a Turkish citizen reveals as much about the internal changes taking place in Turkey today as does his death. Specifically, Dink was individually engaged in his own contribution to the debate over Turkey's future, boldly asserting the historical veracity of the ""Armenian genocide"" in the face of threats and intimidation. As part of this effort, he was convicted in 2005 of ""insulting Turkish identity"" on the basis of an article in which he wrote of the 1915 genocide of Ottoman Armenians, and was given a six-month suspended sentence in October 2005 for his boldness. Both his persecution and prosecution demonstrate the difficult choices facing Turkey on its road to EU membership, well beyond the confines of the Armenia issue. Chance For Change However, as tragic as the murder was, it may nonetheless present a new opportunity for Turkey to recognize the futility of the so-called ""taboo"" on such issues as the Kurdish question and the Armenian genocide. Addressing these two core issues represents more than a question of Turkey confronting with its past, but would actually serve to define Turkey's future. Judging by the swift and strident official reaction to the murder, with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemning the killing as a ""bullet fired against free speech and democracy,"" there is some hope that Dink may ultimately achieve more in death to change Turkey from within than he could ever have accomplished in his lifetime. But the challenge to transform this tragedy into a true turning point for Turkey hinges on the need for Ankara to adopt a new farsighted approach toward both Turkey's past and its future.",,,

The protesters, some waving Turkish and Armenian flags, marched down the street where reports say the prominent journalist was shot three times as he left his office at the ""Agos"" newspaper. One crowd member told Reuters, ""(Dink) was an intellectual who loves Turkey and tries to do a lot of things for Turkey, a man who tries to build friendship bridges between communities. We lost one of our brave hearts.""Dink often angered Turkish nationalists with his criticism of mass killings of Armenians by Turks in the early 20th century. Such criticism is a crime in Turkey, and Dink had faced a series of court cases for his outspokenness, including a conviction for insulting Turkish identity in 2005.He also had said he received numerous death threats before his murder, and he wrote in his last newspaper column that he was so worried about attacks that his head swiveled like a pigeon's as he moved around Istanbul.Turkey, already in an uphill battle to join the EU, now faces even more pressure.'Deeply Saddened'The first EU official to publicly comment on the killing was Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who urged Turkey to bring the culprits to justice.

""Hrant Dink was a journalist, a respected intellectual who defended his views with conviction and who campaigned for freedom of expression and an open society in [Turkey.]""The Armenian issue has been a key part of the debate surrounding Turkey's EU bid.

Senior HHD member Armen Rustamian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service recently that it will not seek representation if the ballot falls short of democratic standards, or if the HHD fails to win a ""sufficient"" number of parliamentary mandates. ""If it becomes clear that the election results are not recognized by international bodies, Dashnaktsutiun will never be part of a government formed by such a National Assembly,"" said Rustamian, echoing a similar warning he issued last September. Rustamian also repeated on January 12 his earlier warning that the HHD would ""become extremely resolute and move into opposition"" if the 2007 elections are perceived as marred by serious fraud. He hinted that Dashnaktsutiun might stage street protests in the event that the vote is seen as less than fair and democratic. ""If you move into opposition, you draw up a corresponding strategy,"" he said. ""In that case, we would use all political means to influence processes with an opposition stance."" Election Criticism The HHD joined other opposition parties in challenging the official outcome of the May 2003 parliamentary elections, but opted to remain in government in order not to jeopardize ""political stability."" A repeat in May of the intimidation, widespread vote-buying, and manipulation of election returns that have characterized successive national ballots since 1995 would negatively impact the Armenian leadership's efforts to build closer ties with the West. Specifically, it could jeopardize the disbursement of funds under the U.S. Millennium Challenge program, and Armenia's participation in the EU's European Neighborhood Policy. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian alluded to those possible repercussions in an interview published last fall in the opposition daily ""Haykakan zhamanak."" ""Everyone must realize that we simply have no more room for holding bad elections, because this time the damage to our people would be not only moral, but material,"" the paper quoted him on October 19 as saying. President Robert Kocharian for his part assured Armenians in his televized New Year's address to the nation that ""I am sure [the elections] will be up to the mark. Free and fair elections should be a priority"" for Armenia. Vote Breakdown Yet even if this May's vote is perceived as meeting international standards for a free and fair election, the HHD's continued participation in government is not a foregone conclusion, but will be contingent on the overall division of votes. At present, the HHD has four ministerial portfolios, none of them relating to the keys spheres of defense, security, and foreign policy. It also holds 11 seats in the 131-strong National Assembly, and Rustamian indicated on January 12 that it hopes to win at least that number of seats in the new parliament. ""We will not remain part of the government if the number of our parliamentary deputies does not enable us to influence the adoption of government decisions,"" he said. ""For example, if two political forces are able to form a coalition without us, we will not join them just to increase their government's number of parliamentary seats. That is, we are not going to become the fifth wheel of any government."" Those comments echo the argument made in December 2006 by another senior HHD official, Hrant Markarian. Speaking in the northern town of Giumri at a celebration to mark the 116th anniversary of the party's foundation, Markarian stressed that a party that won just 11 percent of the vote should not be held responsible for all policies implemented by the coalition, yerkir.am reported on December 15. Markarian said the HHD was ""successful in national issues because we had the president's support. We were unsuccessful in democratic and social issues because we were alone. We were not the [whole] government, we were [only] a part of it.... It was not the government of the HHD."" Implicitly distancing the HHD still further from its coalition partners, Markarian called for ""an organized and systematic fight"" against such ""terrible phenomena"" as corruption and the shadow economy, and for economic policies that would address more effectively such social problems as poverty by substantially increasing pensions and the minimum wage.",,,

Together with several other Turkish experts, Soyak, who is co-chairman of the nongovernmental Turkish-Armenian Business Council (TABC), attended a conference inYerevan on January 13 organized by the Armenian International Policy Research Group (AIPRG) titled ""The Social and Economic Consequences of Opening the Armenian-Turkish Border."" Weighty Demand He told journalists in Yerevan on January 15 that he thinks that, out of solidarity with Azerbaijan, the Turkish government is unlikely to drop its main precondition for lifting the economic blockade it imposed on Armenia in 1993: the withdrawal of Armenian forces from districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic that they currently control. ""We hoped then that the border would open next month. We now want to [see it] open before we die.""""This was the reason why Turkey closed the border,"" Soyak told reporters in Yerevan, referring to the unresolved Karabakh conflict. ""So unless there is movement or progress in this area, I don't see any green light from the Turkish side. But what I see at the same time on the Turkish side is a greater willingness than ever before to approach Armenia. They too are trying to find a way out,"" he added. Successive governments in Ankara have adhered to this policy despite pressure from the United States and the European Union, both of which argue that normalization of Turkish-Armenian ties is essential for regional peace and stability. The Armenian leadership likewise stands for the establishment of diplomatic relations and reopening of the land border between the two countries without any preconditions. Deputy Foreign Minister Aram Kirakosian reaffirmed Yerevan's position on the issue in a speech at the January 13 conference. He urged Turkey to act ""impartially"" toward all regional states and to ""abandon its policy of excluding Armenia from regional projects."" The 1915-18 mass killings of Armenians still hangs over Armenian-Turkish relations (AFP)Speaking to RFE/RL last November, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul made no mention of the Karabakh dispute and reiterated instead his government's demands for joint Turkish-Armenian academic research into the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Gul said Ankara insists on the idea of setting up a commission of Turkish and Armenian historians that was floated by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a 2005 letter to President Robert Kocharian. Kocharian effectively turned down the proposal, however, saying that this and other problems hampering Turkish-Armenian rapprochement should first be tackled by the two governments. Armenia and its worldwide diaspora believe that the 1915-18 killing of some 1.5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey is a proven fact that cannot be disputed by historians. They see the Turkish offer as a ploy designed to scuttle greater international recognition of the genocide. Borderline ObstacleSoyak told the international conference in Yerevan that some of his contacts in the Turkish Foreign Ministry acknowledge that Ankara's reluctance to open its border with Armenia constitutes an obstacle to resolving the existing problems in bilateral relations. He said it also amounts to ""punishing"" eastern Anatolia, the region that stands to benefit most from any resumption of cross-border trade, Noyan Tapan reported on January 16. Soyak nonetheless concluded that prospects for opening the border are remote. ""It's been almost 10 years since we started work on opening the border,"" he said of the TABC. ""We hoped then that the border would open next month. We now want to [see it] open before we die."" Soyak also said that the proposed railway linking the eastern Turkish city of Kars with the Azerbaijani capital Baku, via Akhalkalaki and Tbilisi, was shortsighted without a complementary move to restore the existing rail link between Kars and the northern Armenian city of Giumri, an option long advocated by the Armenian government.",,,

Kirakossian said Turkey should have more equal policies with all countries of the region and should refrain from policies that leave Armenia in isolation and outside regional programs. Turkey has kept the border with Armenia closed for years, due in part to Yerevan's backing of separatists in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan. The deputy minister was speaking at a conference in Yerevan on Turkish-Armenian relations. Other delegates at the conference said that opening the border would increase Turkey's access to the Turkic-speaking countries of Central Asia, where Ankara has sought a greater role since the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse. They said it would also increase trade and boost tourism -- Armenians visit Turkey on vacation in large numbers despite the lack of governmental ties. (AFP)",,,

RFE/RL: How would you characterize Belgium's chairmanship of the OSCE this past year? Karel De Gucht: Considering that the OSCE is, in a way, an organization in crisis due to great divergences between participating states, I think Belgium was successful in holding this organization together. I think this organization is actually in better shape than one year ago. ""We made several attempts at convincing the Russian authorities to allow the OSCE to operate in Chechnya. But Russia's refusal was total."" RFE/RL: In your opinion, will the OSCE be able to maintain this performance in 2007? De Gucht: We are now succeeded by Spain, by my friend Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is an excellent diplomat. People sometimes say that I am not a diplomat, that he is a career diplomat, while I'm a politician. I'm absolutely convinced that he will be an excellent chairman in office. RFE/RL: What do you think will happen if Kazakhstan takes over the presidency in 2009? De Gucht: One must look at the decision we made in Brussels [at the December ministerial meeting], which I consider a wise decision. We said Kazakhstan was eligible. Every presidency, however, must meet the same criteria with regard to guaranteeing democracy, the principles of the OSCE's charter, etc. We also acknowledge the fact that Kazakhstan will in coming months submit a program for democratic reform. On the basis of the evaluation of this program and its implementation, we will make a decision on the 2009 presidency at the next ministerial [meeting] in Madrid. RFE/RL: Let's go back to your presidency. You initially announced that searching for solutions to the frozen conflicts in the CIS was a priority for the OSCE. But these conflicts, including Transdniester and South Ossetia, remain far from being resolved. Do you see this as a failure of the OSCE? De Gucht: This is certainly not a failure of the OSCE. The OSCE's sole function is to be an honest broker, to try to encourage the interested parties to find agreements. In South Ossetia, it is true that there has been a referendum, but we haven't recognized it, and the international community has not recognized this referendum either. On the other hand, there has been a conference of donors for the rehabilitation of South Ossetia. We visited South Ossetia, and I think that with the means we were able to gather, we can rehabilitate South Ossetia. And that changes the facts on the ground. It is true that with regard to Transdniester and South Ossetia, we are currently unable to resolve these frozen conflicts for one simple reason: Russia doesn't want to solve these problems now. And I don't have any levers that could force Russia to do it. I am convinced that the frozen conflict that is potentially the most dangerous is Nagorno-Karabakh. If we fail to find a solution, sooner or later it will pose very serious problems. RFE/RL: What about Chechnya? The OSCE appears to be ignoring this conflict. This is all the more surprising since the OSCE monitored the 1997 elections that brought Aslan Maskhadov to power, and declared them free and fair. Since these elections, the OSCE has remained tight-lipped on Chechnya. De Gucht: We made several attempts at convincing the Russian authorities to allow the OSCE to operate in Chechnya, but we didn't get permission from Russia. We can't force it. I am in favor of a mission in Chechnya; I was even ready to make serious concessions in order to be able to resume our activities in this region. But Russia's refusal was total.",,,

There's solar, wind, fuel cells, nuclear, and more. Many of these seem like viable alternatives to fossil fuels and were part of the sweeping proposals unveiled on January 11 by the European Commission. But some experts have a simpler, more direct way to combat global climate change: planting trees. ""We humans are only part of this ecosystem,"" 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathi said. ""And when we kill part of this system, we are killing ourselves. ""To plant a tree for future generations is a simple gesture, yet a strong symbol of sustainable development,"" Prince Albert II of Monaco said in a statement on the UN website. ""The 2007 aim of Plant For The Planet -- The Billion Tree Campaign is to create an unprecedented mobilization in favor of the environment."" Prince Albert II is the patron of an initiative begun this year by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called The Billion Tree Campaign. It's goal is to at least 1 billion trees in 2007 in a bid to help stem climate change. Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse-gas emissions per year than does the world's transport sector. That's because trees act as ""sinks"" for the environment -- they naturally absorb carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels and the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. And that carbon dioxide is released when forests are cleared by burning. Inspiration From Kenya The initiative was inspired by 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathi, the founder of Kenya's Green Belt Movement, which has planted more than 30 million trees in 12 African countries since 1977. A forest fire near the central Russian city of Kostroma in May 2006 (TASS)When she first began her project, Maathi wanted to address the consequences of deforestation on Kenya's rural population. People no longer had firewood, and topsoil and water resources were being depleted by from deforestation. So Maathi, as she tells UNEP's website, started a campaign to plant trees -- an effort that eventually restored workable land to thousands of rural people around Africa. ""We humans are only part of this ecosystem,"" Maathi said. ""And when we kill part of this system, we are killing ourselves. That's what we have to understand: that this ecosystem must remain as it is, it must be sustained. Because in its survival, depends our own."" Just A Beginning UNEP admits its goals remain modest compared to the world's needs. It says millions of hectares and billions of trees have to be planted to stabilize soil and water resources and to meet fuel-wood needs. An area roughly twice the size of Ukraine, or 130 million hectares, would have to be planted just to make up for the loss of trees over the last decade. UNEP says that would take 14 billion trees a year for 10 years. That is, each person on Earth would have to plant two seedlings a year and care for them. So far, the Billion Tree Campaign says more than 75,000 trees have been planted this year, but that it has received pledges for another 150 million to be planted. Hope In Armenia That's only a dent in the goal of 1 billion trees, but it's a beginning that is certain to grow if more organizations like the Armenia Tree Project step forward. That nongovernmental organization has made perhaps the most significant pledge to date -- a promise to plant 500,000 trees this year in Armenia. The UNEP website offers plenty of practical advice to would-be planters, including what types of trees to grow and a step-by-step guide to planting.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1073949.html,Armenia Opposition Leaders Mull New Alliances ,"January 11, 2007 15:28 GMT",,,"By Astghik Bedevian and Liz Fuller http://gdb.rferl.org/607D60E2-3CF3-47B4-8669-D92F5F279256_w203.gif (RFE/RL) January 11, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Armenia's leading opposition forces are holding negotiations on the possibility of forming new alliances ahead of the parliamentary elections due in May, opposition leaders told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on January 8. National Unity Party (AMK) leader Artashes Geghamian indicated that he is considering ways of teaming up with another opposition heavyweight, Stepan Demirchian and his People's Party of Armenia (HZhK). Former Prime Minister and Hanrapetutiun party Chairman Aram Sargsian is also involved in ongoing talks with fellow opposition parties. Up For Discussion Geghamian told RFE/RL he has held ""some discussions"" with the HZhk. ""We have primarily talked about doing everything to ensure that the upcoming elections are democratic and preventing falsifications,"" he said, but declined to divulge further details. HZhK leaders could not be immediately reached for comment. Geghamian and Demirchian have had an uneasy personal rapport, falling out during the presidential elections of February-March 2003 when they were President Robert Kocharian's main opposition challengers. ""I am really delighted with the current negotiations in terms of their quality and responses of opposition leaders."" -- Hanrapetutiun leader Sargsian The two men joined forces a year later to lead an ill-fated opposition attempt to force Kocharian into resignation with a campaign of street protests. The failure of the campaign opened a new rift between them that appeared to have deepened in May 2006 when Demirchian accused Geghamian of lying about his late father, HZhK founder Karen Demirchian. Geghamian was quick to try to mend fences with Demirchian at the time. Hanrapetutiun leader Sargsian reportedly is also participating in the current talks, which he described as encouraging. ""Formation of alliances is always much easier ahead of elections,"" he told RFE/RL. ""I am really delighted with the current negotiations in terms of their quality and responses of opposition leaders."" He added that the talks have so far focused on the nomination of single opposition candidates in all of Yerevan's 15 electoral districts. But he would not comment on the chances of a new broad-based opposition alliance emerging in place of the largely moribund Artarutiun (Justice) bloc led by Demirchian. It is also unclear whether Geghamian and Demirchian are prepared to conclude a formal election alliance with the more radical Sargsian. Sargsian for his part ""unequivocally"" does not rule out cooperation with the former ruling Armenian Pan-National Movement (HHSh), according to Noyan Tapan on January 9. Electoral Alternative Meanwhile, there is also growing talk of another major electoral alliance that could be led by former parliament speaker and Orinats Yerkir party head Artur Baghdasarian and Samvel Babayan, the former commander of the armed forces of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Former parliament speakder Artur Baghdasarian (Photolur file photo)Babayan launched his Dashink party in late 2005, and told RFE/RL's Armenian Service in June 2006 that he was confident it will win representation in the new parliament to be elected this year. He also said he would not form an electoral alliance with any other party. Among their potential allies is the Union for Constitutional Rights (SIM), a small opposition party currently affiliated with Artarutiun. Hayk Babukhanian, who replaced Hrant Khachatrian as SIM's leader late last summer, in early January did not rule out the possibility of the SIM joining forces with Orinats Yerkir and Dashink. Opposition Welcome Babukhanian dismissed speculation that Baghdasarian's and Babayan's ambitious parties maintain secret ties with President Robert Kocharian. ""If they don't support the current authorities, then they are in opposition,"" he said. Yet another possible election alliance would bring together the small opposition Union of National Democrats headed by Arshak Sadoyan and the Democratic Path party headed by independent parliamentarian Manuk Gasparian, Noyan Tapan reported on January 9, quoting the independent daily ""Aravot."" Gasparian said he is holding talks with ""two or three"" individual political figures who have expressed an interest in running on the bloc's joint list, but declined to name them.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1073763.html,Belarus Russia Sign LastMinute Gas Deal ,"January 01, 2007 11:19 GMT",,,"Belarusian Prime Minister Syarhey Sidorski (file photo) (Bymedia.net) January 1, 2007 (RFE/RL) -- Belarus and Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom signed a last-minute deal on gas deliveries just before a midnight deadline was set to expire. The deal more than doubles the amount Belarus will pay for Russian natural gas in 2007, and will raise it to European levels by 2011. Gazprom had threatened to cut supplies to Belarus from today if a deal was not reached. Minsk had promised to retaliate by interrupting Russian gas crossing the country on its way to Western Europe. Both nations accused each other of blackmail over the dispute, which revived memories of a similar dispute with Ukraine exactly one year ago. Under the deal, Gazprom will gain a 50-percent stake in Belarus's state-owned gas-transport monopoly, Beltranshaz. A Bitter Pill The new price is $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, a substantial increase from the $46 per 1,000 cubic meters that Belarus had been paying. Gazprom had been pushing for a price of $105. ""We signed an agreement for the supply of Russian gas to Belarus and for the conditions of the transit of Russian gas through the Republic of Belarus,"" said Gazprom's chief executive officer, Aleksei Miller, announcing the deal in Moscow. Failure to reach a deal might have left Belarus and its 10 million people without winter supplies of its major energy source and could have led to possible disruptions of gas supplies to the European Union. Belarusian Prime Minister Syarhey Sidorski, speaking at a joint press conference in Moscow alongside Miller, said Belarus had made painful concessions to Gazprom. Belarus buys close to 21 billion cubic meters every year -- meaning its gas bill this year is set to rise from $1 billion to $2.1 billion. Sidorski said higher gas prices will be a heavy burden for ordinary Belarusians. ""As you know, 60 percent of the Belarusian people are victims of Chornobyl [nuclear disaster]. So, we have to go to these victims of Chornobyl, we have to go to the elderly and explain to them that the price for gas has been raised twice more than we expected,"" Sidorski said. ""You know that we had been negotiating a price of between $57 and $75 [per cubic meter], and we were ready to accept this. We had been discussing this price the whole year. But then we were told, 'No.' So, out of respect for our partner, for our relationship [with Russia], and for our European partners, we're agreeing to this price [of $100 per cubic meter]."" Gazprom says the price increase for Belarus is part of the firm's campaign to bring the amounts Russia's neighbors pay for gas into line with world prices. The Russian gas giant says it will continue to raise Belarus's rates steadily over the next five years to European levels, which are currently more than $250 per 1,000 cubic meters. Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, commenting on the deal, said his country now faces a ""new economic reality."" But Still A Bargain Minsk, for now, is still paying less than other Gazprom customers, however. Ukraine will pay $135 per 1,000 cubic meters this year. Georgia will pay $235. Gazprom also agreed on price hikes with Armenia and Moldova. But Belarus is losing more than its affordable gas rates. According to the deal, Gazprom will also gain a 50-percent stake in Belarus's state-owned gas-transport monopoly, Beltranshaz. The Minsk headquarters of Beltranshaz (bymedia.net)Gazprom has long sought to gain control of Beltranshaz as it consolidates its monopoly of transit routes. Lukashenka had vowed never to give shares of the gas-transit network to Russia, but evidently was forced into the deal as a way of staving off even higher gas prices. Under the deal, Gazprom will pay $2.5 billion over the next four years to gain the 50-percent stake. Beltranshaz controls Belarus's local pipelines. Gazprom already owns all of Belarus's transit pipelines, and uses them to ship about 20 percent of its European gas exports. The remaining 80 percent goes via Ukraine. Western critics accuse the Kremlin of using the gas price increases as a political weapon to punish some of its neighbors, such as Georgia, for moving closer to the West. Belarus, though, does not appear to fit into this category. Lukashenka has abysmal relations with the West, which accuses him of authoritarian rule and of abusing human rights. Minsk also seeks closer ties with Moscow. The gas row revived memories of a similar dispute with Ukraine exactly one year ago, which briefly disrupted Russian deliveries to Europe and shook confidence in Russia's reliability as an energy supplier.",,,

Most key issues pitted the United States against Russia, and divisions ran deep on the most fundamental issues.Speaking shortly before the end of the meeting today, U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns outlined a vision of the OSCE as a body with a continued strong mission to promote democracy and defend human rights. The OSCE ""gives objective straight advice about democracy, human rights, electoral practices."" ""One of the key challenges facing all of us in the Euro-Atlantic community is, 'How can young democracies in the Balkans, in Central Europe, in the Caucasus, and in Central Asia become fully fledged democracies?'"" he said. ""And the OSCE is the most important institution available to all of us, the most effective arm of the Euro-Atlantic community, because it is an objective observer of elections. It gives objective straight advice about democracy, human rights, electoral practices.""Differing VisionsA key test of that vision was the debate on a draft declaration on ""strengthening the effectiveness"" of the OSCE, which emphasized the importance of the mission Burns outlined. Burns noted today that Russia was the last country to block the adoption of the text.The previous day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had taken issue with that vision, saying it was imbalanced, judgmental, and didn't address current concerns.Russia has long resented what it sees as the OSCE's meddling in the affairs of the post-Soviet successor states. Lavrov said the OSCE risks ""irrelevance"" if it does not start tackling global threats like terrorism and the drug trade.A declaration on OSCE effectiveness was finally adopted on December 5. Russia showed its displeasure by blocking another text that would have committed OSCE member states to the protection of domestic human rights activists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).The outgoing OSCE chairman in office, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel de Gucht, did not hide his disappointment, saying that ""I can only regret that an important decision on human rights defenders was blocked."" De Gucht noted in his closing remarks that ""a vast majority"" of OSCE members believe they should protect human rights defenders.Overall, de Gucht tried to strike a positive note, saying he hopes the OSCE has put an end to the phase of ""introspection"" -- a reference to the years in which member states have spent arguing about the organization's future role.Going In CirclesOn issues of substance, however, there was little evidence to support this hope, as divisions followed the same basic pattern.U.S. Undersecretary Burns noted the ""profound disagreement"" between the United States and Russia on the latter's treatment of Georgia and Moldova. Burns said he regretted Russia's decision to block agreement of declarations on conflicts in both countries. De Gucht said there was only ""circular"" movement with respect to separatist conflicts in Georgia and Moldova (RFE/RL file photo)He also made it plain that the United States believes Russia has failed to honor its commitments before the OSCE.""Unfortunately, there will be no agreed-upon language in the final document on Georgia and Moldova,"" he said. ""I think the great majority of countries here have called upon Russia to meet its Istanbul commitments made in 1999 -- to withdraw their remaining military equipment from Moldova, to withdraw their troops from Georgia. These two countries deserve to be fully independent and fully sovereign, and the United States will continue to support them in that right.""OSCE Chairman De Gucht also noted that 2006 had only produced ""circular"" movement with respect to conflicts in Georgia and Moldova. He said tensions had run high during discussions of these issues and warned that the OSCE's credibility had been damaged as a result. De Gucht cited an absence of political will, calling for ""mutual concessions"" and saying no one should be angling for an ""all or nothing"" outcome. He warned that resorting to force would not bring sustainable solutions.Kazakh Leadership BidThe OSCE meeting noted some progress in Nagorno-Karabakh, but there were no signs of an impending breakthrough.De Gucht praised the OSCE's outgoing Belgian chairmanship for swiftly defusing the controversy surrounding Kazakhstan's bid to lead the OSCE in 2009. He said the decision was deferred until November next year and is now subject to democratic reforms, which Kazakhstan has promised to undertake. ""So the link between these two elements does seem to be very important,"" he added.The United States led efforts to persuade Kazakhstan to accept a later date, but appeared actively engaged behind the scenes to reach a compromise after Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev on December 4 vowed not to back down.Undersecretary Burns indicated on December 5 that U.S. officials had had ""good"" contacts with their Kazakh counterparts on the sidelines of the OSCE meeting.",,,

The statement was less strong than earlier comments by the OSCE's chairman in office, Karel De Gucht. ""There has been some progress on the issue of frozen conflicts, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" De Gucht said. ""The OSCE has also demonstrated proof of its usefulness recently by defusing the crisis in relations between Russian and Georgia. However, it is a fact that the situation remains largely blocked."" Talk Of Progress The Armenian foreign minister, Vardan Oskanian, had also been upbeat. He told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that the meeting of the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents in Minsk last week gives hope that there is a possibility to achieve agreement, even on the very difficult issues. ""Negotiations around the principles [for solving the conflict] are continuing. The approaches of the sides are getting closer on some difficult issues,"" Oskanian said. Earlier, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov had said that all issues were solved except for one. That sticking point is likely to be the future status of the republic. Azerbaijan wants Karabakh to be given self-government, but within its borders. On this point, Armenia is likely to disagree. Speaking in Brussels, Foreign Minister Oskanian reiterated that Armenia insisted on self-determination. ""We don't see another path for solving the conflict. This is a key problem, a fundamental problem for us. As I have always said, all other issues are based on this issue,"" Oskanian said. ""If Azerbaijan accepts the right of self-determination for Nagorno-Karabakh, then it will be possible to talk about other problems."" Bitter War A predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave of Soviet Azerbaijan, Karabakh seceded in 1988 with Yerevan's help. Armenian forces gradually took control of the mountainous region before seizing a number of adjacent Azerbaijani administrative districts, which they continue to occupy. The conflict claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and drove hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Armenia has insisted that the people of Karabakh be given the chance to vote on their future in a referendum. ""If Azerbaijan is able to have the courage to admit that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh can decide their own fate, status, and security issues, then, indeed, there are prospects to achieve serious progress in this process,"" Oskanian said. But finding that ""courage"" could be difficult for Azerbaijan. RFE/RL Caucasus analyst Liz Fuller says that because Karabakh's population is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian, such a vote would almost certainly support independence. Election Year Over the past 12 months, the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, which is negotiating a solution to the conflict, have warned that upcoming elections in both countries could upset chances for peace. Armenia is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2007. Both countries will hold presidential elections in 2008. Analysts say that election campaigns will increase rhetoric and an unwillingness to compromise from both sides.",,,

Oskanian said the question of whether the region could be autonomous within Azerbaijan is an important part of the talks.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1073155.html,Caucasus Azerbaijani Armenian Karabakh Officials Assess Talks ,"December 01, 2006 14:29 GMT",,,"President made his recent comments on Azerbaijani TV (RFE/RL) PRAGUE, December 1, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Over the past 12 months, the three co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group that seeks to mediate a solution to the Karabakh conflict have warned repeatedly that upcoming elections in Armenia and Azerbaijan could scupper chances of reaching a peace settlement. Armenia is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2007. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan will hold presidential elections in 2008. In the run-up to those ballots, the co-chairs reason, the two countries' leaders will be reluctant to agree on the serious mutual compromises that a settlement will inevitably necessitate. Consequently, a sense of urgency has imbued successive meetings this year between either the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers or the two countries' presidents. The meeting in Minsk on November 28 between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev was thus widely perceived as the last chance for some time to reach even a preliminary agreement.Comments On Azerbaijani TVThe two presidents did not issue any formal statement after their meeting in Minsk. But Aliyev told Azerbaijani National Television on November 29 that since the so-called ""Prague process"" talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers on approaches to resolving the conflict began, the negotiating process has gone through several stages. ""We are approaching the final stage,"" he said. The first Prague talks took place in April 2004, and Aliyev has met with Kocharian seven times since then; the Minsk meeting was their third this year.Aliyev said the Minsk talks ""were held in a constructive way,"" and that ""we managed to a find a solution to a number of problems we could not agree on before."" He added, however, that ""divergences remain on crucial points,"" and that further progress ""depends on us ourselves,"" presumably meaning the conflict sides, as opposed to the Minsk Group. Position 'Unchanged'Aliyev stressed that ""Azerbaijan's negotiating position remains unchanged,"" insofar as any solution must preserve Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. He further stressed that Azerbaijani displaced persons (whose number he said exceeds 1 million, compared with UNHCR estimates of 800,000) must be enabled to return to their homes. Aliyev also said the four resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh adopted by the UN Security Council (in 1993, and which call for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory) must be fulfilled. He said the population of Nagorno-Karabakh ""must be provided with the highest form of self-government"" possible within Azerbaijan. The constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic defines the Nakhichevan Republic as an autonomous republic within the Azerbaijan Republic, with its own parliament, but makes no mention of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia, however, rules out any ""vertical subordination"" of the NKR to the central Azerbaijani government.Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov, who with his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian also traveled to Minsk, similarly described the meeting between the two presidents in a December 1 interview with day.az. He said the meeting took place in a productive and open atmosphere. Mammadyarov said that only one issue remains on which the two presidents have failed to reach agreement, but he declined to specify what it is, referring to the need to keep the peace process confidential. He added that he plans to meet in Brussels on December 4-5 with Oskanian and the Minsk Group co-chairs.Foreign Minister Oskanian for his part was more guarded in his comments on the Minsk meeting, telling journalists on his return to Yerevan late on November 28 that ""I cannot say concretely whether progress was made or not, but both presidents assessed the meeting as positive in terms of atmosphere and constructive approaches,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on November 29. Echoing Aliyev, Oskanian said the presidents ""mainly concentrated on the issues in the document on which no agreement has been reached,"" presumably an allusion to a half-page document, drafted by the Minsk Group co-chairs and enumerating general principles, that the two presidents discussed earlier this year.Oskanian also said that the elections due in Armenia next spring ""will not interrupt"" the ongoing peace negotiations, but he admitted that they could make it more difficult to reach any agreement.Lacking Armenian ResponseKocharian declined to comment on the talks. In Stepanakert, however, Armen Melikian, an aide to Arkady Ghukasian, president of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), expressed concern over the implications of President Aliyev's pronouncements. ""If President Aliyev is saying that the process is moving in a positive direction, that is quite dangerous in itself,"" Melikian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on November 30. ""To my knowledge, his idea of a positive direction is that Nagorno-Karabakh cannot be an independent and sovereign state.""As outlined by the Minsk Group co-chairmen in June, the draft peace plan under discussion envisages the gradual withdrawal of Armenian forces from territory they currently occupy contiguous to the NKR; the demilitarization of that territory, including the strategic Lachin corridor and Kelbacar, and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force; then, at some future date, the future status of the NKR vis-a-vis the Azerbaijani central government would be decided in a ""popular vote or referendum."" Insofar as the population of the NKR is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian, such a vote would indubitably register support for independence. Even so, Melikian admitted to RFE/RL in February that the Karabakh leadership is not enthusiastic about that draft proposal. He said that any discussion of a referendum is inappropriate in light of Baku's a priori insistence that Azerbaijan's territorial integrity must be preserved at all costs.The Armenian leadership, for its part, has repeatedly made clear that it will not sign any final peace settlement that is unacceptable to the NKR.",,,
,D,https://www.rferl.org/a/1073079.html,Azerbaijani President Says Karabakh Talks Nearing Final Stage ,"November 29, 2006 11:59 GMT",,Azerbaijani President claims that talks over conflit region have been positive and foresees an end to the negotiations very soon,"Ilham Aliyev (file photo) (AFP) PRAGUE, November 29, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said today that negotiations on a settlement with Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh are entering their ""final stage,"" RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service reported. ""It has been almost three years that the Karabakh negotiations have been conducted within the Prague [peace] process,"" Aliyev said on national television. ""During this period we have had many meetings at the levels of presidents and foreign ministers. Of course, in these meetings ways of resolving the problem were discussed. There were different stages, but I can tell you we are approaching the final stage of negotiations."" Aliyev's comments, broadcast on Azerbaijani State Television, came a day after his talks with Armenian President Robert Kocharian on the sidelines of the CIS summit in Minsk. Constructive Talks Aliyev assessed the results of his November 28 meeting with Kocharian as ""good,"" saying that the ""negotiations were held in a constructive matter."" The success of future negotiations, he added, will depend on the two presidents. ""The most contentious issues were at the center of the negotiations,"" Aliyev said. ""Lately we have succeeded in resolving some of them. On some of the issues on which we previously disagreed, we now have agreement. But we still have some principal issues on which we have different opinions. And both presidents addressed these issues."" Nagorno-Karabakh, zone of fire (in yellow), presumably set up by Armenian forces. (Source: Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry)Armenia has not yet commented on Aliyev's statement. However, upon arriving in Yerevan on November 28, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian provided a similar appraisal of the presidents' talks that day. ""I can't give you an assessment yet whether there was a progress during the talks or not, but I can tell you that both presidents positively evaluated the meeting itself in terms of atmosphere and constructive approaches,"" Oskanian said. ""I think in coming days the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan will analyze everything in detail, after which they will give concrete instruction to the ministers about further steps to be taken."" The two countries are still officially at war over the predominantly Armenian territory that seceded from Soviet Azerbaijan in 1988. About 30,000 people died in fighting between the two sides before a Russian-brokered cease-fire was reached in 1994. The conflict has been ""frozen"" ever since, with Armenian forces occupying Nagorno-Karabakh. Clear Stance The Azerbaijani president clearly outlined the stance his country is taking in negotiations on a settlement to the longstanding conflict. ""Azerbaijan hasn't changed its position,"" he said. ""Azerbaijan insists on the resolution of the issue [of Nagorno-Karabakh] on the basis of our territorial integrity. The four resolutions of the UN Security Council should be implemented. Azerbaijan's land should be vacated by the occupying forces, and more than 1 million of our citizens should be able to return to their lands. ""Again, Azerbaijan's position has not changed. [Azerbaijan's] territorial integrity should be restored and within that [restoration], the people who live in Nagorno-Karabakh should be given the highest status for self-rule."" Aliyev had strong praise for the role international mediators have had in trying to resolve the dispute. The OSCE Minsk group, co-chaired by representatives of Russia, the United States, and France, has overseen negotiations since the 1994 cease-fire went into effect. ""Respected international organizations saying that the issue should be resolved within the principle of our territorial integrity -- of course this approach strengthens our position,"" Aliyev said. ""Generally, every issue should be resolved in keeping with international law and norms. No issue can be resolved outside of this approach. Because the creation of any kind of precedent can also create problems in the future for other countries.""",,,1

Year after year, officials at CIS summits seem to spend more time questioning the body's existence than advancing its agenda as the largest post-Soviet regional grouping. This year's summit, in the Belarusian capital Minsk, was no different. No Cause Celebre With the CIS about to celebrate the 15th anniversary of its creation on December 8, talk was not about celebration -- just reformation. The summit's host, President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, opened today's summit with warm words about the CIS. But, he added, the grouping was far from perfect. ""It must be acknowledged that some of our goals have not been met,"" Lukashenka told the assembled heads of state."" Nazarbaev says CIS leaders have ordered their foreign ministers to submit a proposal for reforming the grouping by June 1, 2007. This does not mean that they have lost their relevance. We should work more actively in deepening integration, developing economic cooperation, first and foremost, and collectively safeguarding the social rights and guarantees of CIS citizens."" The CIS was established in 1991 with the goal of replacing the defunct USSR with a working economic alliance that would keep the neighborhood stable in the political aftermath of the Soviet collapse. But the grouping has never found its footing. Meanwhile, other regional bodies like GUAM and the Collective Security Treaty Organization have gained greater momentum. Some began to wonder if it was time for the CIS to disband. Russian President Putin (center) and Foreign Minister Lavrov (right) arriving in Minsk today (RFE/RL)Summit participants appeared to have other plans. Nursultan Nazarbaev, the president of Kazakhstan, said today that CIS leaders had ordered their foreign ministers to submit a proposal for reforming the grouping by June 1, 2007. ""Today's summit gives us a good chance to discuss in detail the future of the CIS, in particular the question of raising the effectiveness of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the prospects for its development,"" Nazarbaev said. Earlier, the Kazakh leader had proposed that energy-producing countries within the CIS -- including his own -- should be given greater power within the grouping. It was unclear if that proposal was among the issues discussed today. On The Sidelines In the end, talks on the sidelines of the summit may have been of greater consequence. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Georgian counterpart Mikheil Saakashvili reportedly had what Nazarbaev characterized as a ""very positive"" exchange of opinions during the summit, although the two leaders did not meet separately. Ties between the two leaders have been chilly following Moscow's decision to impose an economic blockade against Tbilisi in September. The Georgian parliament has questioned the merits of remaining in the CIS, and there were doubts whether Saakashvili would even attend the Minsk summit. In the end, however, Saakashvili said that Georgia ""has no right to ignore any rostrum,"" despite what he termed its ""ineffective"" nature. Putin met individually with Lukashenka and Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin. Lukashenka, a stalwart Russian ally, surprised many in recent days when he suggested he would pursue talks with Ukrainian officials on establishing a Belarus-Ukraine relationship much like the long-dormant Russia-Belarus Union. One of the reasons for the new proposal might have been the threat by Russia's Gazprom to drastically hike gas prices for its CIS neighbors. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Robert Kocharian, were also due to meet on the sidelines of the Minsk summit to discuss a possible resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Despite this and other weighty issues on the Minsk agenda, however, most eyes were elsewhere -- namely, on the two-day NATO summit currently under way in Riga.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1072914.html,Armenia Making The Best Of A Difficult Neighborhood ,"November 22, 2006 14:20 GMT",,,"Armenian goods, like these being sold in Moscow, do well abroad (file photo) (ITAR-TASS) YEREVAN, November 22, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Reworked diamonds, crayfish, and brandy do not sound like the ingredients of a successful export economy. Yet, appearances can be deceptive -- and in Armenia's case they often are. These three products sustain an economy that last year expanded by 14 percent according to the World Bank -- faster than any other non-oil sector in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The country's information-technology sector is also growing fast and attracting Western investors. Politically, Armenia -- caught between Russia and the West -- is trying to achieve a balancing act. 'Complementarity'Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Baiburtian describes this as a ""policy of complementarity.""""As far as the interests of Russia are concerned, and its relationship with, [and its] attitude vis-a-vis Armenia's policy of European integration [is concerned], let me say that Armenia is conducting a policy of complementarity,"" Baiburtian says. ""And if you would like me to mention the substance of this policy of complementarity, this is that Armenia, taking into consideration the interests of the major players in the region, attaches special importance to its policy priority of softening the angles of contradiction between these powers."" Armenia would like to replace its Medzamor nuclear plant with a modern facility, but the EU is not keen on bankrolling the venture.For instance, Baiburtian says, Armenia's good relations with Russia are complemented by strong links to the United States.Apart from both countries' interests in the region, both are home to large Armenian diasporas. Each year, Armenian expatriates send home $1.5 billion, which equals the government's annual budget.The diaspora is likely to keep growing. In a recent survey, 65 percent of interviewees said they see ""no future"" for their children in Armenia.Understandable, perhaps, in a country that in recent years has backpedaled somewhat on democracy. Armenia's elections are seen as less and less free, while the country has slipped to 102nd place in the Reporters Without Borders media-freedom ranking. Armenia is losing ground in corruption indices, too -- although on both counts it still beats Azerbaijan and Russia, among others.Armenia is also struggling to keep up with its oil-rich neighbor, Azerbaijan.The two countries are still technically at war over the breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. And while Baku can afford to spend $1 billion on defense this year, Armenia must make do with barely one-quarter of that.Deputy Minister Baiburtian appears unfazed by the disparity: ""Armenia will do what is necessary,"" he says. He also hints at ""other sources"" of aid -- a possible reference to Russian backing.Energy ConcernsArmenia's greatest security concern is energy. Nearly all of its energy infrastructure -- the Medzamor nuclear plant, thermal power plants, and the electricity-distribution networks -- is now owned by Russia. Armenia's Medzamor nuclear plant (AFP file photo)This is where the ""policy of complementarity"" becomes visibly stretched. Baiburtian says that Armenia is trying to diversify sources, pointing to a gas pipeline from Iran that should become operational by the end of the year.However, Western officials say this will mean little as long as the power plants using the gas remain in Russian hands. One diplomat notes that Russia's commercial dominance could prove ""more dangerous"" than its all-pervasive military presence in Armenia.The Soviet-made Medzamor power plant perhaps illustrates well the shortcomings of the ""complementarity"" approach. The European Union has said the plant is dangerous and has pressed Armenia for years to decommission it. The European Commission's deputy head of mission in Tbilisi, Robin Liddell, who is responsible for relations with Yerevan, says decommissioning Medzamor is a key element in the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) action plans the EU has just signed with Armenia. Both the United States and Russia are home to large Armenian diasporas, aiding Armenia's complementary relationship with the two powers.""Medzamor is one of the priorities in the new action plan with Armenia,"" Liddel says. ""This encompasses both a new energy strategy and decommissioning strategy. This has been a long-term priority for the European Commission and the European Union. The ENP action plan gives us the political commitment of the Armenian government to this activity.""Armenian officials counter that Medzamor is safe. They've gradually pushed back the decommissioning date and the EU now believes it won't happen before 2016.Armenia would like to replace Medzamor with a modern nuclear facility, but the EU, while keen to support the decommissioning of old reactors, is not keen to bankroll the new venture.In its energy-diversification efforts, Yerevan is building up a network of new thermal and hydroelectric power stations.Alternative SourcesThe gas pipeline from Iran is central to these efforts. Sarmen Baghdassarian, head of the policy planning department in the Armenian Foreign Ministry, showcases the project as another success of the ""policy of complementarity"" -- this time balancing the United States and Iran.""It's hard to find in the world a country that has excellent relations with Russia, with the United States, with the European Union, and with Iran,"" Baghdassarian says. ""When, two years ago, we were talking about the Armenia-Iran gas pipeline, everybody was saying to us that it's a dream. But the pipeline is, as our deputy minister mentioned, after two months, it will be operating.""There is, however, one regional power and neighbor whose relations with Armenia have yet to benefit from the policy. Armenia still has no diplomatic relations with Turkey. The border between the two countries remains closed and the ""Mother Armenia"" statue in Yerevan is still surrounded by military hardware pointing grimly towards the mountains where Turkish territory begins.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1072847.html,East Womens Rights Project Employs Film As Advocacy Tool ,"November 20, 2006 14:00 GMT",,,"Sairash, the main character in the film ""Elechek,"" in March 2006 (RFE/RL) NEW YORK, November 20, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Seven short documentary films have emerged from an ambitious project by the Open Society's Institute's Network Women's Program to focus attention on the plight of women in post-Soviet societies. The films confront some of the most acute gender problems in countries like Armenia, Georgia, Lithuania, Russia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine --strained transitional societies -- through the eyes of local directors. The OSI's seven-film project is called ""Gender Montage,"" and was produced by local filmmakers in cooperation with women's rights advocates and researchers. Some of the accounts are grippingly eloquent. The best of them transcend ""in-your-face"" moralizing to probe humanity under inhuman conditions. Three's A Crowd In the Kyrgyz film ""Elechek,"" Take Sairash is a woman who rejects her husband's polygamy. Spurned for a younger wife by a man with whom she has spent the best years of her life and whom she still dearly loves, Sairash refuses to accept the situation but finds it increasingly hard to fight. Scornful relatives, a judgmental community, inequitable divorce laws -- nothing seems to protect her. Breaking the shackles of tradition and prejudice, Sairash eventually discovers herself and emerges as strong and independent -- capable of standing up for her own beliefs. Nurgul Asylbekova, from the OSI's Women's Program for Kyrgyzstan, which produced ""Elechek,"" tells RFE/RL that four in 10 Kyrgyz women who seek psychological counseling are affected by the stress of being sidelined as second or third wives. Sairash's case is not isolated, she says. ""Usually the first wives turn [to counseling], but also the second and even the third,"" Asylbekova says. ""First wives are looking for advice on their property rights and psychological counseling. Young wives are also looking for advice because they are vulnerable in the property issues, they worry about children's rights, and so on. Why has this problem been resurrected? After [Kyrgyzstan] gained independence, women were sidelined on a massive scale everywhere. The industries [in which women worked] are in disarray -- women who were employed in the light industries and had some rights are now practically on the street. They have no social protection at all and no guaranteed social rights."" Asylbekova claims that such factors have led to a revival of a more patriarchal attitude in Kyrgyzstan -- regarding women as property, as objects of desire and pleasure, but also as a work force. With no women in parliament, legislative help is probably far off. Prevailing ""traditional"" wisdom dictates that it is better for a woman to become a second or third wife than to remain out of wedlock. Asylbekova says polygamy has become fashionable and has even led to heated competition among Kyrgyz men for multiple wives. Migrant Lives ""New Penelope"" is another documentary from Central Asia -- this time Tajikistan. Women whose husbands have left for Russia to work as migrant laborers evoke comparisons with the eponymous wife of the mythical Greek hero Odysseus, who waited patiently for him to return from war. The men's absence places a heavy burden on these Tajik women, who must provide for themselves and their children until the men can send money home. Sometimes the money never comes, forcing wives to enter polygamous marriages simply to feed themselves and their children. Marital bonds are tested and often break apart. But the wives at home and their husbands abroad face similar fates: grueling labor and abuse. Zuhra Halimova, the executive director of OSI-Tajikistan, tells RFE/RL that the effects of thousands of Tajik men leaving to find migrant work can be seen within all layers of society, and in the film. ""It's actually talking about the generations of women: the mothers who are feeling sorry for their daughters, the wives who are waiting for their husbands and feeling sorry for them because they know that the conditions in which [their husbands] are living are not pleasant -- they had to leave and they also suffer,"" Halimova says. ""And at the same time, [the film] provides an opportunity to actually look at human capacities in which the constraints in life due to the circumstances are making them act differently from the way they would usually be in their traditional context."" Halimova says that polygamy in Tajikistan is a result of class and economic diversification in the society. Those who can afford it take second or even third wives. Armenian Collision Armenia provides another of the OSI project's works, called ""Women's Happiness Or Men's Dignity."" This film examines the conflict between tradition and modernity through the lives of two women: One protagonist is a divorcee who as a struggling artist liberates herself and finds creative fulfillment; the other is a widow who dreams of happiness within a male-headed household. Despite their places at opposite ends of the social spectrum, both women work hard and raise families as single mothers: Armenuhi Tadevosyan, the Women's Program coordinator of OSI-Armenia, tells RFE/RL that the drive for modernity -- or as she calls it, ""Europe-ization"" -- of Armenia collides with tradition. ""The characters...have two extremes, and it is really the same in the society,"" Tadevosyan says. ""There is polarization, and you can see two camps in the society -- for example, one that is following traditions, [and] the other one that is protesting. And sometimes it is very difficult to set up discussions between these two camps."" Although each of the seven films examines specific issues, there is a distinctive thread that unites them all: an increasing drift from what it is still described as ""post-Soviet."" Even the lingua franca of the former empire -- Russian -- has given way to local tongues. But the each of these films' settings appears to be pursuing its own path of development 15 years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- and they have fewer and fewer common strings.",,,

Brussels will give these South Caucasus countries access to the EU market in return for commitment to political and economic reform. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on November 14 spoke to RFE/RL Armenian Service Director Harry Tamrazian and RFE/RL Azerbaijani Service acting Director Kenan Aliyev in Brussels. RFE/RL: These neighborhood action plans seem to be a very interesting project. But what will they bring to the people of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia? JavierSolana: It will bring to the people of Azerbaijan a lot. As you know this is a plan of cooperation with the government with your countries [Armenia, Azerbaijan] and also Georgia. It has an objective, an objective to bring all the countries closer to the European Union with a mechanism, the Neighborhood Policy, which is the same technology that we used with the countries that were finally members of the European Union. So we analyze different sectors of the governmental activity, in economics, in politics etc. and then we construct an action plan.... It will therefore be something on politics and something on the economy, all the sectors of the economy, not only macroeconomic but also microeconomic. And that is an important part of it. It is agreed between the government of the respective country and the European Union. Therefore it is done [and] you can do whatever you want to do. So if you do it properly, it's not the European Union governing your country, but it's you governing yourselves [while] receiving help from the European Union. So what does this bring to your people? If the government is good, if the government does things properly, the European Union is [going to continue helping your government.] Being closer to the European Union doesn't mean being part of the European Union. RFE/RL: And if the government is not good, then what? Solana: Well if the government is not good, as you can imagine, the cooperation with that government will diminish. If the government [makes good use] of the help that we give, the Neighborhood Policy will keep on helping and increase the cooperation. So this is a bilateral agreement and therefore a bilateral gain. You do things better, you get more. You don't work sufficiently, the government doesn't do as much as it can, then [the government] will get less. But the political technology that's used is the same that has been used in the [new] countries of the European Union. Sector by sector, chapter by chapter in a very well-organized fashion. We have a tremendous experience in doing it. RFE/RL: There are a lot of conflicts in this region. In Georgia, in Azerbaijan. Armenia and Azerbaijan are still in a state of war. There is a cease-fire, but they are still negotiating. The action plans say some things about ""frozen conflicts."" How is the EU planning to help these countries to cooperate and how is the EU planning to resolve these conflicts? Solana: This approach that the European Union has established with you [the countries of the South Caucasus] has a bilateral component, because at the end the plan is for every country and is not the same for every country. But it has a common objective of helping to construct regional cooperation. I don't think that in the world of today, in the globalized world, countries that are in a particular part of our planet, in this case, in a very specific place, close to the European Union, close to the Black Sea, close to the Caspian Sea. This is a very important region because it unites two parts of the planet and therefore has a very important role. But we would like those three countries to work among themselves as a region and that is the focus of the program we are establishing with you. And therefore we want to work with you as a region. As a consequence of that the conflicts that exist in the region have to be solved, otherwise it will be very difficult to construct [regional unity].... Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov in Brussels to sign the accord (official site) So the first thing, in order to have a region that works together, that can progress together, that can take advantage of all the added-value of working together, has to be accompanied by a resolution of what you have called ""frozen conflicts."" Now I hope very much that [the EU] will be a catalyst for good. RFE/RL: European officials are talking about shared values. Foreign ministers are talking about shared values, but if you look at the situation on the ground, for instance in Azerbaijan or in Armenia, these countries are still struggling to hold free and fair elections. Still you can see political prisoners, media is attacked by the government. There's a hunger strike right now of 10 or 15 journalists protesting government pressure. Do they really share your European values? Some critics say that you are rewarding them not because of values, but because, for example in Azerbaijan, you [the EU] needs some energy, you need Azerbaijani oil and gas. Solana: The example you use is wrong as we don't get any energy from Azerbaijan. RFE/RL: But the EU signed an energy agreement with Azerbaijan last week? Solana: Well, a memorandum of understanding. But most of [the EU's] energy doesn't come from Azerbaijan. For us Azerbaijan is not a source of energy as other countries are. We would like Azerbaijan to develop as it's an important country and we would like Armenia to develop as it's an important country. Now as far as values, we share the values of democracy and the rule of law.... What we are signing with you, the Neighborhood Policy, the action plans, these have elements that call very clearly for a direction.... That includes not only in doing good for the economy but also [doing good] for the democratic values that we defend and you defend. RFE/RL: About the European Neighborhood Policy, can you give some hope that some day these countries will join the European Union or will you just shut the door? Solana: You have to understand that the European Union does not have a vocation of [representing] half the world. We have the vocation of [being] a group of countries with very good and solid relations with the rest of the world and also the countries that are closer from a geographical point of view, and from a values point of view they will be closer to the European Union. But being closer to the European Union doesn't mean being part of the European Union. And of course we can sign with countries very profound cooperation agreements, but membership is a different story that can not be infinite in number, you have to understand that. We never say, ""No,"" but we say let's keep on moving and let's keep on cooperating as much as possible. Both your countries [Armenia and Azerbaijan] have profound relationships with other regions of the world. You don't [have to have an exclusive relationship] vis a vis the European Union. You have other important countries and regions of the world, with which you have very solid relationships and you are not asking to be part of them. But with the European Union you have probably the closest and most comfortable relationships. RFE/RL: Are you concerned about the deterioration of Russian-Georgian relations? Solana: We are trying to help find solutions to the tensions of the [recent] period. I think the first thing that has to be done is to lower the temperature and in that direction we're working very hard. I hope both presidents will meet and they will talk frankly and they will try to lower the temperature. The Georgians have to know that they live in a region, in a place with problems, in the neighborhood, with South Ossetia, with Abkhazia, [problems with] defending their territorial integrity. But to solve these problems the people that live in Abkhazia, the people that live in South Ossetia, [must] have to want to continue being in Georgia and for that the Georgians have to work also.... They are going to have the same neighbors forever and therefore when you know you're going to have neighbors forever you try to think ahead and try to organize your life knowing that, and therefore trying to have good relations with the neighbors. It is true that within that neighborhood there is a huge country like Russia and sometimes it's more difficult to construct [a relationship] but that relationship has to be constructed.... So I think that most important at this point in time is to lower the temperature, to calm down and begin recuperating and normalize the relationship. RFE/RL: If Kosovo gained independence, some people have argued it could become a precedent for the ""frozen conflicts"" in the former Soviet Union. What do you think about that? Solana: My opinion is that no conflict is equal to the other and conflicts normally have an origin, they have a development, and they have a solution. And [it's unlikely that] the origin, the development, and the solution will be the same in the three conflicts.",,,

The agreements offer aid, improved trade, and more political cooperation in exchange for political and economic reforms. But EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told RFE/RL, they don't even mean what the EU would call a ""membership perspective."" ""The neighborhood policy is not for membership. I have to say that very clearly. But at the same time, this is the policy of today. Therefore, the future is clearly not prejudged,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""But these countries have to use this momentum now to do everything to get the experience that we have, the knowledge, the possibilities of cooperation. We want to help them, because best practices are there already. And the easiest thing is to look at what others have done in order to become successful."" 'Ring Of Friends' Brussels wants a ""ring of friends,"" which eventually could include countries such as Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco, and Ukraine. Those countries would get access to the EU's vast internal market. In return, Brussels would get the promise of reforms -- and, ideally, the regional security that successful reforms would ensure. Under the agreements, the EU offers economic help and help in reforming the justice, energy, education, health and other sectors. 'Frozen Conflicts' Brussels has also said that the accords should help defuse separatist disputes in the three South Caucasus countries. In Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia are trying to secede, while Azerbaijan has a dispute with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan are meeting today to discuss Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov says the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process is moving in the right direction: Strategic Region In recent years, the South Caucasus has gained greater strategic significance for the EU and the West. Since its 2003 Rose Revolution, Georgia has pursued a more pro-Western course. It has made good headway with political and economic reforms -- although the problem of implementing legislation on the ground still remains. And in September, Georgia was offered an ""intensified dialogue"" with NATO. Speaking today at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili praised closer ties with Brussels. He called for deeper EU involvement in Georgian political and strategic issues. Javier Solana (file photo) ""At every negotiation, let's say on the conflict issue, everywhere there should be EU representatives present,"" Saakashvili said. ""Georgia is certainly strongly in favor of EU involvement. We should make sure that in every energy issue [EU representatives] should be present, in a conflict issue they should be present, because energy is a European issue, a conflict issue is a European issue, wider economic cooperation is a European issue."" While Armenia has made some successful economic changes, its political reforms remain sluggish at best. Azerbaijan is the region's exception. With huge oil and gas deposits, the country's economy is growing rapidly -- and expected to continue apace. But questions remain about Azerbaijan's rampant corruption, dubious electoral practices, and rights abuses. Drunk on oil and gas, its detractors say, Azerbaijan can act with virtual impunity. Standards For Energy? And with the EU always ready to diversify its energy supply to avoid dependence on Russia, critics have said the union is prepared to compromise its own standards in exchange for access to Azerbaijan's vast energy reserves. In an interview today with RFE/RL, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana denied the charge: ""Most of [the EU's] energy doesn't come from Azerbaijan. For us Azerbaijan is not a source of energy as other countries are. We would like Azerbaijan to develop because it's an important country and we would like Armenia to develop because it's [also] an important country."" The EU has defended its stance, saying that the countries in the South Caucasus are coming from different starting points -- and must be judged accordingly. The EU's special representative to the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, said it's better to embrace these countries than to leave them out in the cold. ""The problems would be larger if the two countries were left outside completely. That would mean that developments would be totally unpredictable; there would be immense dangers. The two countries are now included in a cooperative framework with the European Union which also includes a perspective for the future,"" Semneby said. ""It would be much easier to control the risks in the short term, and in the longer term to find a solution based on mutual benefits in a new reformed neighborhood that will look very different from the one we have today.""

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1072678.html,UN Agreement Brings Iron Silk Road Project Closer To Realization ,"November 13, 2006 12:30 GMT",,,"A rail link between China and Russia being constructed in July (ITAR-TASS) UNITED NATIONS, November 13, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- An ambitious UN-backed project to connect the Far East to Western Europe by a rail link moved one step closer to reality with the signing of a transportation agreement in Pusan, South Korea, on November 10. The first international deal pursuant to the development of the Trans-Asia Railway Network (TAR) is a milestone. But significant obstacles remain to complete the TAR -- including technical impediments and funding for nearly 6,500 kilometers of railroad. Improving Access To Landlocked Countries The November 10 deal is crucial for landlocked countries, whose access to world markets is heavily dependent on efficient rail links to international ports. Twelve of the world's 30 landlocked countries are in Asia, and 10 of those are TAR members. (UNESCAP) TAR is often compared to the ancient Silk Road, the medieval trade route from China to Europe that connected the farthest corners of the known world for centuries. The seeds of this ""Iron Silk Road"" were sown in 1960, when an initial plan envisioned a continuous 14,000-kilometer rail link between Singapore and Turkey, via Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and Iran. But with rapid economic growth and increasing interdependence, the TAR has grown exponentially. Today, it encompasses a complex network of nearly 81,000 kilometers spread over four major geographical regions. Kim Hak-su is the executive director of the UN body overseeing the TAR (UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, or UNESCAP). He says the agreement signed by 18 transport ministers on November 10 from as far afield as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, and the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan could usher in a new era of regional integration. Regional Integration ""We are talking about a long-run regional integration through the Trans-Asian Railway and, as you know, we have also settled the Asian Highway one year [ago],"" Kim says. ""So it is a good step forward, and one day all these countries will realize and recognize the importance of the linking [with] each other."" Rail cars waiting to offload oil at the port of Vladivostok, Russia (TASS file photo)Ten of TAR's 28 members -- including Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan -- did not sign the agreement, but are expected to participate in the project nevertheless. Afghanistan is among the countries lying on the route of the ancient Silk Road that is neither a TAR signatory nor expected to participate. Kim says Kabul's absence has to do with internal political divisions, but he hopes Afghanistan will join the TAR later. ""I think Afghanistan would join later,"" Kim says. ""But at the moment, without Afghanistan, the [Trans-Asian] railroad is still linked to the West."" One of the technical hurdles confronting TAR is the different rail widths, or gauges. Rail systems in the former Soviet Union, for instance, use a wider gauge than those in China. The system in India, on the other hand, differs from them both. Kim says the problem will be overcome with the help of containers, which are already widely in use worldwide. Getting Over The Hurdles ""We can actually develop [road-access ports] in each of the different gauge areas, and then this drive port [will] receive [truck-mounted] containers that can be re-shipped or transferred to the different gauges,"" Kim explains. ""So, our experts say that different gauges are not a major problem."" UNESCAP experts believe that port efficiency can be enhanced through the integration of rail and shipping to avoid port congestion. That is a key factor in Asia, which is home to 13 of the world's 20 largest container ports. Kim says China, South Korea, and Russia are all major backers of TAR. Once completed, the project will significantly enhance their rail systems' interoperability. ""Russia is very excited and also their TSR, Trans-Siberian Railway, is well-established,"" Kim says. ""They have doubled lines, and then they electrified all the TSR from Nakhodka, Vladivostok, to St. Petersburg. And it can be also linked easily to Helsinki."" UNESCAP calls existing rail links within the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) ""railways of international importance."" There are still sticking points for the TAR, like funding and political strains of the type that kept North Korea from attending the November 10 signing. But the first international deal to implement the project -- signed nearly a half-century after TAR's conception -- might buoy the hopes of those who were beginning to get discouraged.",,,

They have a lot in common. All of them are seeking independence and closer ties with Russia. The states from which they have broken refuse to give them up. The international community is unwilling to recognize them. But perhaps ""frozen"" is not the best way to characterize these conflicts. RFE/RL correspondent Luke Allnutt spoke to two experts to find out more. Laurence Broers is an expert on the South Caucasus. ""Calling these conflicts 'frozen conflicts' is a misnomer. It's indicative of lazy thinking and it's a regrettable shorthand for conflicts and conflict settings that I think are dynamic and ever-shifting."" Listen to the complete interview with Broers (about 8 minutes): Real Audio Windows Media ""What is specific to the South Caucasus is a historical legacy of the absence of indigenous state-building projects. So when these three states -- Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan -- became independent, this came out of nowhere. They had been very briefly independent prior to the reabsorbtion in the Soviet Union in 1918-1921. But these states lacked indigenous traditions of statehood."" ""What I see as the key to this concentration of conflicts in the South Caucasus is interaction between relatively strong nationalist movements and a very weak institutional environment. That's quite different from Central Asia, where nationalist movements were far weaker, or the Baltic states where you did have strong nationalist movements but you had a much more organized and conflict-averse institutional environment."" Harri Kamarainen is a Caucasus expert at the OSCE's Conflict Prevention Center in Vienna. ""It's not the most accurate term anyway, anymore, because if we look at what has been happening, especially in the conflicts in the South Caucasus area -- I'm speaking about Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts -- there are a lot of things taking place. Actually during recent years, the conflict-settlement mechanisms in South Ossetia are rather active and that is the case also in the Karabakh conflict."" ""The South Caucasus is a fairly small geographic area and in this fairly small geographic area we have more than 40 different ethnic groups, not only ethnically different, but culturally, religious[ly], linguistically different.

Ahead of the visit, President Vladimir Putin officially gave his stamp of approval to his Azerbaijani counterpart's visit to EU headquarters and NATO. ""I would like to congratulate you on your successful visit to Brussels,"" Putin said. ""I know, indeed, the visit was very practical, concrete. Important agreements have been made regarding Azerbaijan's participation in European efforts in the energy field."" Behind The Scene But some observers believe that away from the microphone, Putin cannot have much good to say about Azerbaijan's efforts to curry favor in the West. Ali Kerimli, who heads leading Azerbaijani opposition party Popular Front, says the issue was sure to be a hot topic during today's talks. ""Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for Aliyev to stay in two places at the same time,"" Kerimli said. ""To be at a friend, a satellite, a supporter of the authoritarian Russia, and at the same time to participate in all the NATO and EU integration programs."" A commentary in the Russian daily ""Kommersant"" on November 9 suggested that, as compensation for this policy, Russia might ask Azerbaijan to participate in an energy blockade of Georgia. The daily wrote that the Kremlin is prepared to offer Russian investment in Azerbaijan's energy sector and also to supply Russian armaments at a discount. Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan, branded as a ""strategic partnership,"" are complicated. The Karabakh Card Shain Abbasov, an independent analyst based in Baku, says many in Azerbaijan believe that the resolution of Azerbaijan's conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh is in the hands of Moscow, not in the West. Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of Armenia since a 1994 cease-fire ended a six-year war. Russia plays a key mediating role as the sides try to come to an agreement on the region's final status. However, Kerimli has said the conflict serves Moscow by helping Russia to preserve its influence in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Analyst Abbasov says the Kremlin's policy toward Armenia, a Russian ally, remains more benign than toward Azerbaijan. ""Armenia is a traditional Russian ally in the southern Caucasus,"" Abbasov said. ""You know that Azerbaijan is a member of GUAM, which in principle is considered to be an anti-Russian political grouping and nobody tries to hide it very much. So there is no doubt that Azerbaijan is trying differently from Armenia to balance its foreign policy between the West and Russia."" Analysts have also suggested that some practices in Azerbaijan -- antidemocratic ones -- serve to bring it closer to Russia than the West. Everything Under Control Abbasov, for example, says Aliyev is clearly following Russia's model of ""controlled democracy."" Azerbaijani police breaking up an opposition demonstration in November 2005 (AFP)""In fact, Azerbaijan is clearly following the Russian way, the way of Putin's democracy,"" he said. ""It is under way already now. There is no question which way Azerbaijan might choose. Aliyev's administration has already made a choice, and we are already heading down this road. You can see all this pressure on the press, a very strict authoritarian way of rule and so on. In fact, we have a very similar situation as in Russia."" As for other topics, economic issues were likely on today's agenda -- including natural-gas prices. . Moscow could threaten, as it has done to other neighboring states of late, to raise considerably the price of its gas exports to Azerbaijan. But the move might not provide much leverage in getting Baku to avoid making overtures to the West. Azerbaijan uses only an estimated 10.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, and only 1.5 billion of that is imported from Russia.",,,

It is one with sweeping implications for the entire CIS. Other ex-Soviet republics are watching the controversy and weighing the impact it may have on their own residents. PRAGUE, October 6, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Throughout the CIS, public response to the crisis has ranged from sympathy for Georgia, to support for Russia's actions, to fear of what the crackdown may ultimately mean for others. In Belarus, where the government maintains a policy of unwavering loyalty to the Kremlin, residents were quick to defend Moscow -- and criticize Georgia as an upstart nation that is only getting what it deserves. ""Every single citizen of the former Soviet Union living as a migrant in Russia should take the situation in Georgia really close to heart."" ""The Russians did the right thing,"" said one Belarusian man. ""The Georgians are now behaving in a very defiant way with regard to Russia. In a way, they've provoked them into stirring up scandal. But I don't think there will be a big scandal. I think that Russia could be even tougher on Georgia."" But elsewhere, people expressed dismay at the intensity of the crisis, and defended Georgia's steps to break free of Russian influence. ""I think it's wrong to suspend all the links between Russia and Georgia,"" said a woman in Kazan, the capital of the autonomous republic of Tatarstan. ""We live in 21st century, I think they need to talk to solve the situation."" ""My attitude toward Georgian government policy is very good,"" said a second Kazan resident. ""Georgia should live its own life, they should find there own path without us. Every country should be independent."" Concern In Russia's ""Near Abroad"" But the conflict between Moscow and Tbilisi is more than just a spectator sport for the former Soviet republics that, to varying degrees, have pursued their own independent identities in the 15 years since the breakup of the USSR. For some, the Russian blockade on transport and communication links to Georgia has had an immediate knock-on economic effect. For others, the clampdown on the rebellious CIS nation may act as a signal to temper their own pro-Western ambitions. Perhaps most critically, for many it means the fear that Moscow's measures against Georgia may eventually be extended to other neighbors as well. That concern raised to outright alarm with Putin's call for a crackdown on illegal migrants and markets dominated by foreign workers and groups with so-called ""mafia ties."" Russia's Federal Migration Service responded promptly, proposing tough penalties for businesses that employ illegal migrants, limiting border crossings, and reducing visa periods. Among the proposals is a measure to impose a quota system that would limit migrants to visits of between 90 to 180 days, depending on their country of origin. Today Georgians, Tomorrow Tajiks? The measures are sure to strike fear in the hearts of many economic migrants from the former Soviet republics, who have flowed by the tens of thousands into Russia to find work to support their families back home. A Tajik migrant worker in Moscow said he was watching the Georgia situation with growing concern. ""Every single citizen of the former Soviet Union living as a migrant in Russia should take the situation in Georgia really close to heart,"" he said. ""If it's the Georgians today, it will be Uzbeks and Tajiks tomorrow. We should not be happy about what is happening to Georgians."" Russia's unrelenting assault on Georgia has also raised speculation that Moscow is using the dispute to bring other Westward-looking ex-republics back into its sphere of influence. In this, it may get assistance from Belarus. Moscow is looking to clamp down on the number of Georgians entering its territory visa-free via Belarus. To that end, it says it will press Minsk to create a visa regime with Georgia. Belarus initially indicated that economic and communication ties with Georgia would continue unchanged. But on October 5, Vadzim Papou, chairman of the Belarusian House of Representatives commission that oversees contacts with CIS states, gave clear signs of a reversal, saying ""consultations are under way"" on Georgian transit through Russia. Russia Resurgent, As West Watches Many see the Georgia conflict as part of the Kremlin's broader power struggle with the United States, which has also sought footholds in the region. Both Washington and Brussels have responded relatively meekly to the Georgia crisis, sparking fears that Moscow's impact in the post-Soviet arena the may again be on the rise. The conflict has raised concerns that Moscow is using the dispute to bring other Westward-looking ex-republics back into its sphere of influence. Among the countries watching the developments with concern are Moldova and Ukraine -- which, together with Georgia and Azerbaijan have sought to consolidate a Western-leaning bloc with the GUAM regional grouping. GUAM's pro-Western aspirations have already been struck a blow by the political ascent of pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovych to Ukraine's prime ministerial post. But the sanctions against Georgia could do even more damage. Hennadiy Udovenko, a member of the pro-Western Our Ukraine faction and former foreign minister, has blasted the Russian stance on Georgia, saying it is using the blockade as a warning to other like-minded countries. ""Russia would like to renew its influence in the post-Soviet space, and to that end is conducting an imperialist policy in order to undermine the sovereignty of the post-Soviet states,"" Udovenko said. ""In particular, this is currently demonstrated by Russia's attitude toward Georgia."" Economic Realities Moldova since March 2006 has suffered the effects of a ban on wine and agricultural exports to Russia. The embargo has meant a dramatic decrease in the impoverished country's much-needed export income. Chisinau says those sanctions -- similar to the wine ban imposed on Georgia at the same time -- reflect the Kremlin's displeasure with Moldova's Western aims. The recent referendum in Moldova's separatist Transdniester region, in which voters overwhelmingly opted for eventual union with Russia, has only raised tensions between Chisinau and Moscow. Vlad Cubreacov, who heads the opposition Christian Democrat faction in the Moldovan parliament, says ideally, the current troubles in Georgia should prompt an expression of support from the West. ""The Republic of Moldova is already suffering important losses due to the Russian embargo,"" he said. ""But the Georgian case must give us hope and show us the right way -- the way of principles, correctness, and the way of imposing, with help from the West, respect for the integrity and sovereignty of our country."" A Vulnerable Neighbor In Armenia, the effect of the Georgian transport ban has been immediate. Armenia is highly dependent on Georgian transit for its Russian imports and exports. Now, with railway, road, and air traffic blocked, Armenian businessmen say they are scrambling for ways to get their goods to Russia. ""Russia would like to renew its influence in the post-Soviet space, and to that end is conducting an imperialist policy in order to undermine the sovereignty of the post-Soviet states."" The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti and the Ukrainian port of Ilyichevsk will reportedly continue to handle Armenian cargo bound for the Russian market. But lawmaker and Kilikia brewery owner Ashot Baghdasaryan says his business and others are already incurring significant losses as a result of the blockade. ""There is information that our shipment has been stopped on the Russian-Georgian border. It's a very big problem for businessmen,"" Baghdasaryan said. ""I think both Georgia and Russian should have stopped and remembered that they have international agreements. There is no declaration of war between them, and I hope it won't reach that stage. I wish they could respect the international agreements they have signed and not put Armenia in this situation."" Gestures Of Support Oil-rich Azerbaijan has been careful to maintain warm ties with Moscow even as it seeks influential friends further afield. But some officials suggest Baku may be willing to fill the vacuum left by Moscow. ""Georgia may try to introduce some products to markets in Azerbaijan which it wanted to sell in Russia,"" said opposition lawmaker Ali Masimov. ""Georgia may also try to buy some products from Azerbaijan which it wanted to buy from Russia."" Oqtay Haqverdiyev, who heads the Cabinet of Ministers department on economic policy, said the sanctions will have no immediate impact on Azerbaijan. However, he allowed for the remote possibility that an extended crisis could affect the operation of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which transits Georgia. In the short term, those most likely to suffer financially from the blockade are the 500,000 Azerbaijanis who live in Georgia, many of whom send money home to help support their families in Azerbaijan.",,,

On the sidelines of the 61st UN General Assembly currently under way in New York, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova on September 25 held ministerial-level talks, where they discussed the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transdniester. In the last 15 years, frozen conflicts in the GUAM region, namely in Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, have affected the lives of over 16 million people. Not only that, but they've remained a threat to international peace and security, according to a joint statement by the GUAM foreign ministers to the General Assembly. Greater Awareness NeededThe push for greater recognition seems to have worked. A discussion on frozen conflicts in the General Assembly is now scheduled for November 6. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said that GUAM will continue preparatory activities until that time. ""The GUAM heads of state in their joint declaration on the issue of conflict settlement called upon [UN] states and international organizations to further facilitate, within their competence, the process of settlement of conflicts in the GUAM area,"" he said. ""Therefore, the inclusion of the new item on the conflicts in the GUAM area in the agenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to raise [the] awareness of the assembly about dangerous developments emerging from those unresolved conflicts.""Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk told the General Assembly that the protracted conflicts continue to destabilize peace and security in the region, and prevent economic development. What's needed, he said, is global awareness.""It is an important step that will help to draw the attention to the need of more active and effective steps of the international community in order to achieve progress and settlement in conflicts on the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Moldova,"" Tarasyuk said. ""These conflicts are among the main obstacles for the full-scale democratic transformations in the region, which is among the core elements of the regional policy of Ukraine.""International Help NeededGeorgia, in particular, is placing high hopes on the General Assembly debate. It is dealing with two frozen conflicts -- in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In November, South Ossetians will vote in a referendum on independence. Speaking at the General Assembly on September 22, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said international organizations needed to lend a hand to find a solution.""The essential elements of this package must include the demilitarization of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, backed by the active engagement of the UN, OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe], the European Union, and other international organizations,"" Saakashvili said. ""This must include direct dialogue between parties on the ground, and here I mean the central Georgian government and the separatist authorities -- so that together we can assume responsibility for rebuilding the peace.""Russian ObjectionsRussia, however, is not impressed. It dismissed the GUAM member states' attempts to engage a wider UN audience in matters that Moscow considers foreign-policy priorities. In particular, Russia supports independence drives in Transdniester and South Ossetia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the GUAM initiative a ""propagandistic step"" and said that hearings at the General Assembly will not produce anything positive.And last week in an interview with a Greek newspaper, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that Moscow will not allow GUAM peacekeepers into frozen-conflict zones, regardless of what is discussed at the General Assembly.As Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, it certainly won't be plain sailing for GUAM.",,,

He spoke with RFE/RL's Armenian Service by telephone on September 12 after talks in Paris with the U.S., French, and Russian co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group that mediates the negotiations. He described the talks as ""very good and effective."" However, he gave few details, saying only that they focused on ways of reinvigorating the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, which faltered this summer after initial reports of progress. ""They believe that it is still possible to make some additional progress before the end of this year or before our parliamentary elections [due early next year] at the latest,"" Oskanian said. Ministerial Meeting Is Key He said the mediators are trying to arrange a meeting between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, adding that such a meeting could take place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month. The Minsk Group co-chairs, among them U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza, were to hold similar talks today in London with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov. ""The results [of their efforts] can be assessed only after their meeting with the Azerbaijani foreign minister and, if there is agreement, after the two ministers' meeting,"" Oskanian said. The latest round of Minsk Group diplomacy began amid talk that yet another Armenian-Azerbaijani summit on Karabakh could be held on the sidelines of a CIS summit in Belarus slated for October 16. Presidential Meeting In The Cards? Armenian presidential spokesman Victor Soghomonian recently told RFE/RL that he does not rule out the possibility of a meeting between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan if talks between the countries' foreign ministers are held. Foreign Minister Oskanian says he agrees with that assessment. ""Only after the ministers meet and clarify whether there is a chance to continue negotiations and make further progress will it be possible to talk about a meeting of the presidents,"" Oskanian said. Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev have already met twice this year in unsuccessful attempts to agree on a framework peace accord put forward by the mediators.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1071156.html,World Freedom House Ranks Most Repressive Countries ,"September 07, 2006 15:52 GMT",,,"Defendants at a trial in Uzbekistan, one of the most repressive countries in the world, according to Freedom House (RFE/RL) MOSCOW, September 7, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The U.S.-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House has issued its annual compilation of the world's most dictatorial nations. The Central Asian nations of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan rank among the top offenders on the NGO's so-called ""Worst of the Worst"" list, as does the Russian republic of Chechnya. Freedom House says it hopes the list will be used by national governments and the United Nations to address the world's most pressing human rights abuses. Freedom House says its ""Worst of the Worst"" list is especially critical in a year when the United Nations' newly formed Human Rights Council begins work. The list, which covers the period from December 1, 2004, to November 30, 2005, pinpoints eight countries as having the worst human rights records over the past year. They are: Burma, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. It also calls attention to two territories, Chechnya and Tibet, where civilians are subject to what Freedom House calls intense repression. The report rates 192 countries in terms of political and civil freedoms, assigning labels of ""free,"" ""partly free,"" and ""not free."" This year, 46 percent of the countries were ranked as ""free""; an additional 30 percent were ""partly free.""Overall, says Kristie Evenson, the director of Freedom House Europe, the trend during the past decade has been an expansion, rather than reduction, of freedoms. Central Asian TrendThere are, of course, exceptions. Evenson says the general tendency in Central Asia appears to be a regression away from democratic development. The most pronounced examples are two of the lowest-ranked countries in the Freedom House report, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Both received the poorest possible rating in terms of civil liberties and political rights, and were deemed ""not free."" Uzbekistan, the site of the May 2005 Andijon massacre, was noted as undergoing a decline in civil liberties. Speaking to RFE/RL from Freedom House's European headquarters in Budapest, Evenson said the trend is evident throughout Central Asia -- with one possible exception, Kyrgyzstan, which received a rating of ""partly free."" ""Kyrgyzstan has shown some potential promise on the political front,"" she says. ""But the general trend in Central Asia is actually a constriction of freedom. What we're seeing in Central Asia is a continuing tightening of a lot of these regimes in terms of having little hope for political freedom or civil liberties that will have an improvement in the near future, particularly in places like Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan."" Little Hope In Chechnya Chechnya was also singled out for particular criticism. Russia overall received a rating of ""not free."" Its breakaway republic, the site of a civil war that has raged since 1999, saw a continuation of the conflict in 2005, with no letup in accompanying reports of torture, disappearances, and war crimes.The Freedom House report notes that the year also marked the March assassination of Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov. That, the report says, ""further reduced already faint hopes that a peaceful resolution to the crisis could be achieved."" Evenson says the situation in Chechnya appears to offer little hope.""On Chechnya, following a trend unfortunately for almost a whole decade, it's got the lowest category, qualifying it for the 'worst of the worst.' We don't witness any real improvement in political and civil liberties. The security situation has continued to make any real participation by citizens more fiction than fact, and this situation doesn't look to be improving in the near future,"" she adds.Azerbaijan A ConcernThe South Caucasus nations of Georgia and Armenia fared slightly better, both maintaining ratings of ""partly free."" Azerbaijan, however, was penalized, receiving a rating of ""not free."" Evenson says the rating is due in part to the country's November 2005 parliamentary elections, which came under widespread criticism as flawed by ballot stuffing and other procedural violations: ""The score of Azerbaijan is a consistent score from years past where we don't see a lot of political reform efforts that happened during the time of the report,"" Evenson says. ""What we do see is a questionable election process, judicial processes that don't appear to be fair, and freedom-of-assembly issues clearly have been of concern in Azerbaijan.""Belarus, Ukraine Going In Opposite DirectionsAmong the worst-ranked nations was Belarus, which has received a rating of ""not free"" every year since the Freedom House survey was launched in 1996. The NGO says the regime of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka grew increasingly dictatorial during 2005, with authorities clamping down on free media and public expression in its bid to ensure Lukashenka's reelection in 2006. One bright spot on the list was Ukraine, the only country in the former Soviet Union, besides the Baltic states, to receive a rating of ""free."" The report spans the period that saw the conclusion of the Orange Revolution, the nonviolent public movement that brought pro-Western politician Viktor Yushchenko to power. Evenson says that, and the largely peaceful transfer of power that followed, contributed in large part to Kyiv's positive rating.""Ukraine is having the promise of quite a lot of political and civil reforms,"" she says. ""When you see that, when this study was conducted, we did have an orderly changeover of government with a respect to the legislation that was in place, political and electoral processes as well as the beginning of a reform of a larger legislative system, it provides hope that the mechanisms and structures in Ukraine -- although still very weak -- can produce the beginnings of a base of a more viable and long-lasting democracy.""Elections In Iran, Iraq, AfghanistanIran and Iraq both received ratings of ""not free."" Iraq saw some improvement was credited with an improvement in its political rights over a period that saw the country's first national elections since the toppling of Saddam Hussein -- the January 2005 vote for the pre-parliamentary National Assembly. June 2005 saw presidential elections in Iran bring hard-liner Mahmud Ahmadinejad to power, prompting the United States to criticize the ballot as ""flawed."" Evenson says the Islamic Republic remains hampered by a weak political mechanism.""The core of their problems is a political system which is either young, very weak, in formation, or quite highly suppressive in the case of Iran,"" she says. ""In terms of how that affects the citizens in these countries, what we're seeing is that their basic rights to be part of the democratic process, to be able to express basic civil and political rights, is still quite constricted or is being more constricted.""Afghanistan, which received a rating of ""partly free"" in the new Freedom House report, in 2005 completed the Bonn process initiated after the fall of the Taliban regime to create a system of democratic governance. Its September parliamentary and provincial-council elections were marked by unusually low voter turnout, but were generally deemed to be free and fair. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Moldova all received ratings of ""partly free."" What was then Serbia and Montenegro, and has since become two distinct, independent countries, was ranked as ""free.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1070808.html,CIS Armenia Latest To Agonize Over Anthem ,"August 24, 2006 14:47 GMT",,,"(Public domain) Emblems, flags and national anthems. There are few things, it seems, more likely to stimulate the energies and passions of legislators in the fledgling states of the old Soviet Union. Now, it is Armenia's turn. PRAGUE, August 24, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The mood is a little fractious in the Armenian capital this summer, and the weather isn't helping. The mercury has climbed inexorably above 40 degrees Celsius. But not even the boiling sun can match the heat generated by the debate over whether Armenia should ditch its national anthem and adopt something more modern, more attuned to today's national aspirations. The very idea, according to the nationalist Dashnaktsutiun Party -- which forms part of the coalition government -- is tantamount to sacrilege. The Dashnaks like things just as they are. Listen to a portion of Armenia's national anthem (31 seconds):Real Audio Windows Media ""Mer Hayrenik,"" or ""Our Fatherland,"" was penned by Mikael Ghazavi Nalbandian, one of the most revered nationalist figures of the 19th century, and adopted as the national anthem by the short-lived Armenian state of 1918-20. Thereafter it was banned by the Bolsheviks and became a hymn of protest before being reinstated as the national anthem when Armenia declared its independence in 1991. So why change it now? Take a look on Armenian blogsite blogrel.com and you get an idea why. The song is too wimpy, complains one visitor -- and too gloomy. Take verse three. None of the usual chest-thumping banality of national anthems here. But perhaps not calculated, either, to fill the hearts of young schoolchildren with patriotic joy. Armenia is, of course, not the first post-Soviet state to go through the agonies of this debate. Russia fretted over it through the 1990s, briefly replacing the Soviet anthem with a temporary lyric-free piece by 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka. Listen to a portion of Russia's national anthem (35 seconds):Real Audio Windows Media A 22-person commission made up of Armenia's wisest and best has been sifting through 85 candidates to come up with a new anthem. In 2000, it once again reverted to the Soviet-era melody -- albeit with new words to replace paeans to ""Lenin's ideas"" and the ""unbreakable union"" of the Soviet state. ""Sacred Russia,"" the new version proclaims, ""protected by God."" But divine care was not enough to persuade liberals like Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the opposition Yabloko party, who warned that the reversion to the Soviet tune was a harbinger of terrible things. Georgia's Trials In Georgia, too, the debate was fierce. But no nostalgia there. Two years ago, it ditched the existing post-Soviet anthem in favor of a new song. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili (right) sings the national anthem with reservists and children at a military training camp near Tblisi earlier this month (epa)Legislators said the fresh tune had more appropriate lyrics and -- so they hoped -- a catchy new melody. But many Georgians were unimpressed -- like this man on the street speaking to RFE/RL's Georgian Service. ""They used to criticize our football and rugby international players because they didn't sing the last national anthem,"" the man said. ""But you tell me how they're going to sing this one. Very interesting! Nobody will be able to sing it. Then everyone will ask again why they're not singing. Because they won't be able to sing it!"" Or this man, who clearly thought the old Soviet Georgian anthem couldn't be bettered. ""It needs the sort of words that will give you goose pimples,"" he said. ""I remember how the anthem used to be. 'Eternal glory to the nation' -- what do you think of that, eh? Pretty damn good!"" Anthem Tidbits For every republic of the former Soviet Union, there is a similar saga. Post-Soviet Moldova briefly adopted the Romanian anthem, but abandoned it in favor of a new song to reflect the individual Moldovan identity. That anthem is called ""Our Language"" -- which in Moldova is virtually identical to Romanian. In Kyrgyzstan, a debate continues to simmer over its post-Soviet anthem. The source of contention is a single word, ""beikut,"" which -- according to which Kyrgyz dialect you're speaking, can mean either ""peace"" or ""bad luck."" Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, meanwhile, had no individual anthem during the Soviet era. But it adopted an anthem after the revival of its statehood. That song is now played at all official events, together with the Russian anthem. But to return to Armenia, where a 22-person commission made up of the country's wisest and best has been sifting through 85 candidates to come up with a new anthem. It's a heavy burden, as one of the judges, Culture Minister Hasmik Poghosian, makes clear in remarks to RFE/RL's Armenian Service. ""When we really are no longer 'wretched' and 'forsaken,' I'll enter the anthem competition myself."" -- Felix Bakhchinian ""It's been very difficult. When you have to listen to one song after another... And clearly you can't feel the same way about all of them,"" Poghosian said. ""And it would have been wrong to make a quick decision and immediately announce the winner."" It's hard work made harder still by some unrelenting criticism of the whole project. Felix Bakhchinian, director of the Charents Literature and Art Museum in Yerevan, is one of many who think this is not the time for choosing a new anthem. ''I too want to get rid of references to the motherland as 'wretched and forsaken,' like we have in the existing anthem,"" Bakhchinian said. ""But we need to solve more pressing problems before we begin talking about the anthem and other state attributes. Right now we have higher priorities to meet. And when we really are no longer 'wretched' and 'forsaken,' I'll enter the anthem competition myself."" Harsh words from a man highly respected in the world of Armenian art. But not harsh enough to stop the commission. It's narrowed the field down to five finalists -- and word is that one song is head and shoulders above the rest. Its lyrics, based on a poem by early 20th-century poet Yeghishe Charents, drops much of the grim imagery in favor of praise for the ""sun-baked taste of Armenian words."" Listen to a portion of the proposed new Armenian anthem (23 seconds): Real Audio Windows Media Whatever their views on the tune and its lyrics, Armenia's legislators would be wise to pay attention. If parliament adopts its planned new code of ethics, legislators will have to demonstrate that they can sing all the words.

PRAGUE, August 7, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- There will be little talk of colored revolutions in Georgia this week. The euphoria that swept the young team of Georgian ministers when the Orange Revolution triumphed in Ukraine in January 2005 has all but dissipated. For a few heady months, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili saw himself -- and Georgia's own Rose Revolution -- as the catalyst for change throughout the CIS. Ukraine was followed by Kyrgyzstan and perhaps Saakashvili could imagine a region ruled by presidents fashioned in his own image.Now it's time for a reality check.Instead of Yuliya Tymoshenko, Ukraine has Viktor Yanukovych.Regional AlliancesBut how serious a blow is this to the proponents of democratic change? Salome Zurabishvili was foreign minister of Georgia at the time of the Orange Revolution and responsible for forging a strong strategic alliance with the new democratic Ukraine.""This is bad for Georgia from the point of view that Russia will conclude that these revolutions are not irreversible, and that with a little help it is possible to reverse the process,"" Zurabishvili said. ""So all of Georgia's efforts at this time should be directed at assuring the Georgian people, Russia, and international society that this process in Georgia is irreversible.""But while Ukraine may no longer be so steadfast an ally of Georgia in the face of Russian pressure, some see here a triumph for Ukrainian democracy -- and, by association, the values that both the Orange and Rose revolutions are built on. Cory Welt, the deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for International and Strategic Studies in Washington, said that what ""we have seen in Ukraine is the most democratic outcome that we could have envisioned."" ""So, in that regard it doesn't change anything. What it does change is the fact that they had linked the democracy agenda to this pro-Western agenda. And I think nobody had anticipated that in Ukraine those wouldn't necessarily go together,"" he said.Erkin Alymbekov takes a similar view. The deputy speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament told RFE/RL's Radio Azattyk that last week's events in Ukraine had been a triumph of common sense. President Viktor Yushchenko (right) shakes hands with Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv on August 3 ""About half the population of Ukraine is supporting Yanukovych, and his political stance is very popular there. Yushchenko -- who did not play a game around the colored revolutions, and who put his personal, patriotic, and presidential duties higher than ordinary ambition in order to deal with the political crisis, who put forward Yanukovych as the prime minister of the coalition government -- this, I suppose, is the fair and right stance,"" Alymbekov said.Indeed, as far as Kyrgyzstan is concerned, said Martha Brill Olcott -- a senior associate with the Russian and Eurasian Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. -- the reality is that little will change.""I don't think it will affect Kyrgyzstan honestly except that it will make its foreign policy easier -- just because their foreign policy is closely oriented to Russia,"" Olcott said.Problems In Central AsiaIndeed, there are few in Kyrgyzstan likely to mourn the fading of the Orange Revolution. Any hopes harbored by democratic reformers that the so-called Tulip Revolution would become a model for democratic change in Central Asia have so far proved premature.In fact, if Olcott is correct, it is one of the more authoritarian regimes of the region that may have more cause for concern.""Ironically, Kazakhstan may have more problems. I mean Kazakhstan is one of those places that did build very explicit bridges to the new regime and Ukraine, and with the new government of Ukraine,"" Olcott said. ""Kazakh-Ukrainian economic cooperation was pretty good before and I think they saw this as strengthening the free market in Ukraine and in Kazakhstan's interests.""Yet, here too ""business as usual"" seems the more likely outcome. Kazakhstan and Ukraine have a mutual interest in seeing business relations develop.Konstantin Gabashvili, the chairman of the Georgian parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, takes heart too from the fact that Yushchenko still controls Ukrainian foreign policy and Yanukovych's commitment to continue democratic reforms.""As for [Ukraine's] main political course, the main thing for us is that according to the document they signed, it shouldn't really change. Yushchenko guaranteed that the course would remain unchanged, and if anything happens, Yushchenko will react on that,"" Gabashvili said. ""I can't say that the situation is easy in Ukraine, but it's not tragic and it is not worth giving any reaction but support the main course of Ukraine.""No tragedy but, for the moment at least, the end of the colored revolutions. Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka said in 2005 there will be no rose, orange, or banana revolutions in his country. This week he must feel time is on his side.(RFE/RL's Georgian and Kyrgyz services, and Washington correspondent Julie A. Corwin, contributed to this report.)",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1070008.html,Armenia Defense Minister Discusses Political Ambitions ,"July 21, 2006 10:15 GMT",,,"Sarkisian speaking to RFE/RL in Yerevan on July 20 (RFE/RL) YEREVAN, July 21, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- In a rare interview, Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian spoke on July 20 with RFE/RL's Armenian Service about his recent alliance with the Republican Party of Armenia, his reported presidential ambitions, and his relationship with President Robert Kocharian. Sarkisian, the former wartime commander of Karabakh Armenian forces, also gave his backing to a compromise solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict favored by international mediators. Sarkisian said that Kocharian does not object to his far-reaching alliance with Armenia's largest governing party, the Republican Party of Armenia (HHK).Rift Between Sarkisian, Kocharian?Many Armenia observers believe that Sarkisian's decision to align himself with Prime Minister Andranik Markarian's HHK does not sit well with Kocharian, who is widely expected to resign after completing his second term in office in early 2008. Reports have pegged Sarkisian as a possible candidate to succeed Kocharian. But Sarkisian's ties to the HHK could conflict with the president's perceived efforts to contain the HHK and secure his own political future. Asked whether he thinks he could be sacked by Kocharian for joining the HHK, Sarkisian replied: ""How can I rule out the possibility of the president dismissing me when he is the supreme commander in chief [of the armed forces] and can do that with a single signature? But I rule out his doing so in connection with [my affiliation with the HHK] because the president of the republic has fully approved my intention. I think there will be an occasion for him or his spokesman to speak about this. Besides, what is the use of taking steps contradicting the opinion of the supreme commander in chief?"" Observers say Kocharian does not necessarily back Sarkisian's reputed presidential ambitions, despite having closely cooperated with the powerful defense minister for nearly two decades. Sarkisian himself says he has not yet decided whether to run for president in 2008.""It's very difficult to say [if I will run], because I've never given it serious thought,"" he said. ""You may not believe me, but I am speaking sincerely. I will make my decision after the parliamentary elections are held [in May 2007]. All I can say is that I've never strove for any position. All of my friends know this."" Working With HHKSpeaking to RFE/RL late on July 19, Prime Minister Markarian was likewise vague about Sarkisian's presidential ambitions and stopped short of ruling out his own participation in the 2008 presidential ballot. ""We will see in 2008,"" he said. Andranik Markarian (epa file photo)Markarian also described as ""logical"" Sarkisian's decision to join his party. ""He felt that he likes the party's ideology and program,"" Markarian said. ""Besides, we have closely cooperated during all these years and are simply formalizing this fact."" Sarkisian has repeatedly made it clear that a possible presidential bid hinges on the HHK's performance in next year's parliamentary elections. This has been construed by opposition leaders and other government critics as a sign that the Republicans will seek to hold on to their parliamentary plurality in the next National Assembly at any cost. The HHK boasts the largest faction in the current National Assembly, controlling at least 41 of its 131 seats. Sarkisian said on July 20 that he would consider maintaining that number in the next Armenian parliament an excellent result. ""I haven't yet discussed this topic with members and leaders of the Republican Party,"" he said when asked how many parliament seats it is looking to win. ""But I have decided for myself that if the Republicans win up to 21-22 percent of the vote in the elections, I will consider that satisfactory; [if they get] up to 25 percent, [I will consider that] good; [if they get] more than that [I will consider that] excellent."" Karabakh CompromiseSarkisian, the former wartime commander of Karabakh Armenian forces, also endorsed a compromise solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict favored by international mediators. He said he agreed with the Armenian government's overall acceptance of a recent plan that calls for a referendum on Karabakh's status after the liberation of Azerbaijani territories surrounding the disputed region. ""Yes, I am in favor of the proposed principles. How can I be against something that I have said for years?"" But at the same time he left room for maneuver in the event of popular opposition to the peace plan. ""If the public has a different opinion, another political force will win a majority and pursue its policy, and that would be very good,"" he said. ""How can I oppose something which is to our people's liking?"" (by Hrach Melkumian, Armen Dulian, and Ruzanna Khachatrian)",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1069596.html,NagarnoKarabakh Mediators Take The Process Public ,"June 30, 2006 16:17 GMT",,,"Fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1989 (Photolur) PRAGUE, June 30, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Lifting the veil of confidentiality that has marked the Karabakh peace process since it began in 1992, the French, Russian and U.S. co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group tasked with mediating a solution to the conflict have over the past eight days gone public with a summary of the basic principles currently under discussion. While the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has confirmed that those principles are largely acceptable, its Armenian counterpart has highlighted several points that were either not clarified or not discussed the interview U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza gave on June 22 to RFE/RL's Armenian and Azerbaijani services. Meanwhile, the Karabakh Armenian leadership has rejected one point on which Armenia and Azerbaijan have reportedly reached agreement, namely holding a referendum on the future political status of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR). The Karabakh Armenians have further signaled their reluctance to cede all the Azerbaijani districts they currently occupy before a firm agreement is reached on the future status of the NKR. Confidentiality Broken Over the 14 years that the Minsk Group has been trying to mediate a political solution to the Karabakh conflict, those involved have generally abided by a ""gentlemen's agreement"" that the negotiating process should remain confidential. The rationale for doing so is primarily to avoid derailing the peace process by alerting the public in one or other country to unpalatable concessions required that opposition parties might seize upon to discredit national leaders prepared to accept those concessions. But the co-chairs, who have on several previous occasions deplored the failure of the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents to prepare public opinion for inevitable concessions, seem to have concluded that going public may encourage the two presidents to demonstrate what they term ""the necessary political courage"" and agree at least to the basic principles of a settlement before the perceived window of opportunity for doing so closes with the approach of parliamentary elections in Armenia in May 2007. The basic principles, as outlined in a statement by the co-chairs on June 22 to the OSCE's Permanent Council in Vienna and posted on June 28 on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, point to a ""phased-package"" approach to resolving the conflict, meaning that the various elements of a settlement are agreed on simultaneously, even though they are implemented successively, with one key aspect -- the final status of the NKR -- to be decided by ""a referendum or vote"" at some unspecified future date. ""These principles include the phased redeployment of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh, with special modalities for Kelbacar and Lachin districts [separating Karabakh from Armenia proper],"" said the co-chairs. ""Demilitarization of those territories would follow. A referendum or population vote would be agreed, at an unspecified future date, to determine the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh."" ""An international peacekeeping force would be deployed,"" added the statement. ""A joint commission would be agreed to implement the agreement. International financial assistance would be made available for demining, reconstruction, resettlement of internally displaced persons in the formerly occupied territories and the war-affected regions of Nagorno-Karabakh. The sides would renounce the use or threat of use of force, and international and bilateral security guarantees and assurances would be put in place."" Those provisions correspond very largely to the ones contained in the draft peace settlement proposed by the Minsk Group in May-July 1997, the key difference being that the 1997 document contained no specific mention of Kelbacar. Practice Makes Perfect The mediators said the conflicting parties would also have to work out practical modalities of the Karabakh referendum. ""Suitable preconditions for such a vote would have to be achieved so that the vote would take place in a noncoercive environment in which well-informed citizens have had ample opportunity to consider their positions after a vigorous debate in the public arena."" In a statement released on June 26, the Armenian Foreign Ministry highlighted what it said were further key details and omissions. It noted that the co-chairs' statement did not note the need to grant the NKR ""intermediate status,"" presumably meaning that it would be under international control, until the holding of the referendum on its final status. A further ""gray area"" not touched upon in the Armenian Foreign Ministry statement is the future status of several districts that prior to 1988 were part of the then Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but which Azerbaijan took control of in May-June 1991, expelling the Armenian population. The Armenian statement stressed that the co-chairs, for the first time, have affirmed their support for the idea, first floated in December 2004 by NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche and former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio, of a referendum on Karabakh's status, and that the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents have agreed on doing so. Kocharian (second from left) and Aliyev (right) with other leaders in Bucharest on June 5 (epa)It further said that at the recent meeting in Bucharest on June 4-5 between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani side rejected an unspecified suggestion by the co-chairs as to how that remaining area of disagreement could be resolved. By contrast, the co-chairs' statement avoided allocating blame for the failure to reach an agreement, saying only that ""the two presidents failed to agree."" Speaking to journalists in Yerevan on June 29, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian described the ""principles"" under discussion as ""all-encompassing,"" in that they cover all the principles affecting the removal of the military consequences of the conflict. He added that ""only after full agreement on all these basic principles will the parties begin work on elaborating an agreement on the settlement of the conflict. In other words, the agreement on principles will be comprehensive. The final agreement may envision implementation over time."" Corridor Of Uncertainty Asked to clarify the co-chairs' reference to ""special modalities"" for Lachin and Kelbacar, Oskanian explained that the negotiating text specifies that ""there will be a [Lachin] corridor linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia."" He added that Armenia will insist that that corridor ""has the same status"" as Karabakh. Oskanian also explained that due to security considerations, ""Kelbacar can be returned only after the referendum is conducted and the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh is determined."" He said this is the point of disagreement between the two sides to which the co-chairs referred in their statement to the OSCE Permanent Council last week. Oskanian said that the ""principles"" stipulate that the vote on Karabakh's status will take place among the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Some Armenian opposition politicians have expressed concern that the entire population of Azerbaijan would participate in the referendum and vote against Karabakh's independence. Asked the Armenian leadership's overall assessment of the ""principles,"" Oskanian said ""this is not a perfect document. For anyone. However, there are enough solid and balanced provisions, with the right trade-offs on the main issues -- status, territories, and security -- that we are prepared to continue to negotiate on the basis of these principles,"" Noyan Tapan reported. But the Karabakh Armenians, who to their frustration are excluded from the Armenian-Azerbaijani talks under the Minsk Group aegis, are unhappy with at least two of the provisions of the ""basic principles."" Even before this week's disclosures, the NKR posted a statement on its website on June 12 citing the arguments against determining the republic's future status in a referendum. The article reasoned that holding a further referendum would call into question the legality of the referendum of December 10, 1991 in which the overwhelming majority of the region's Armenian voters opted for independence from Azerbaijan. It noted that most Azerbaijani voters declined to participate in that plebiscite. Return To The Front And on June 26, Vahram Atanesian, who is chairman of the NKR parliament standing committee on foreign relations, was quoted as rejecting the ""principles"" as outlined by the Minsk Group co-chairs on the grounds that they entail the ""unequivocal return"" of the occupied territories -- the NKR's sole bargaining chip -- in return for a decision at some unspecified future date on the republic's status. Atanesian said his perception is that the Minsk Group is pressuring Armenia to accept proposals that ""are fully consistent with Azerbaijan's interests."" Insofar as Azerbaijan has not definitively rejected the current ""principles,"" the present situation is reminiscent of that in the summer of 1997, when Armenia accepted, albeit with reservations, the modified Minsk Group package proposal, while Azerbaijan wavered, and Stepanakert rejected it outright. The biweekly independent Armenian paper ""Iravunk"" on June 27 drew the comparison between the current principles and the 1997 plan, but went on to make the point that unlike his predecessor Levon Ter-Petrossian, President Robert Kocharian would never risk publicly making a case for mutual compromise with Azerbaijan. Instead, the paper suggested, Kocharian left it to the Minsk Group co-chairs to do so.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1069546.html,Caucasus Mediator Says Karabakh Peace Requires TradeOffs ,"June 29, 2006 11:20 GMT",,,"Matthew Bryza (Trend) WASHINGTON, June 29, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- In an interview with RFE/RL --> http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/06/36564d4e-f6bd-4d73-b001-5277c8ec7924.html last week, Matthew Bryza, the new U.S. co-chair of the Minsk Group tasked with moderating negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, spoke about the prospects of a resolution to the conflict. The Minsk Group is under the mandate of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Some of Bryza's comments -- particularly about the possible terms of a framework agreement -- caused a commotion in Armenia and Azerbaijan with both Foreign ministries commenting on the interview. RFE/RL Washington correspondent Julie Corwin spoke to him again on June 28 about his original interview and what the heads of state need to do to achieve peace. RFE/RL: How surprised were you that the interview caused a stir in the region? Matthew Bryza: I was not surprised it caused a stir to tell you the truth, because we knew -- the co-chairs knew -- and my predecessor Steven Mann, the co-chair before I assumed responsibility on the very day of that interview, knew that what they had just announced at the OSCE was significant and would make people think twice, and would spark, as we like to put it, a robust debate in the region. I was simply in the unenviable position of having been on this newest assignment for an hour and I was the guy that got to explain the decision that others had made before me. No, I wasn't surprised that a robust debate was sparked. What did surprise me though was that people spoke so quickly in reacting to the interview without reading the publicly available document that the co-chairs issued at the OSCE in Austria, which laid out in much greater detail everything. RFE/RL: Among the responses to your interview have been comments from each side blaming the other for failing to agree to a referendum. Which side, if any, is actually telling the truth? Bryza: We can't go through every single account and every single statement by both sides during this interview obviously, but leave it to say that these core principles that were developed over the course of two years by the co-chairs and [Armenian President Robert] Kocharian and [Azerbaijani President Ilham] Aliyev and their foreign ministers, ultimately weren't agreed to by the two presidents. So the two presidents share responsibility for not reaching an agreement, and I wouldn't say that either is more responsible than the other. But it's not over either, I mean, any time they can simply say, ""OK, we agree to these core principles or we've agreed to alter them a bit and let's take the package."" RFE/RL: In your earlier interview, you said it was very unhelpful for either side to discuss the possibility of the resumption of the conflict. Nevertheless, on Friday of last week [June 23], Ilham Aliyev described the efforts of international mediators as hopeless and he said that Azerbaijan would retake Nagorno-Karabakh by whatever means necessary. How do you read his statement? Were you disappointed to hear him taking such a belligerent stance? Bryza: Those statements have been more commonplace than they ought to be and I'd stand by what I said last Thursday, on June 22, that talk about recapturing Karabakh by force or any use of force by any party is simply not helpful. It's not necessary because there is a viable framework on the table that just requires a little bit more political courage on both sides to forge a compromise, though I stand by what I said, it's not helpful. RFE/RL: In the statement [by the OSCE co-chairs] you said, ""We see no point now in continuing the intensive shuttle diplomacy, which we've engaged in over several months."" Is that a strategic decision to say we're going to back away and hope that that prompts them to renew momentum or is it just exhaustion or frustration? ""The two presidents share responsibility for not reaching an agreement, and I wouldn't say that either is more responsible than the other."" Bryza: It's a mere statement of fact that my predecessor, Steven Mann, and my current fellow co-chairs, have exerted all of the creativity and all the negotiating energy that they could and they have gotten this framework of core principles as honed as possible in their judgment, such that the presidents, in their mind, need a little time to think things over and decide whether or not they can accept or adjust this framework. But what we're saying in the statement is that there is no more room for diplomatic creativity to make this piece of metal shine a little bit more brightly. It's honed and you have to decide whether you want it or not, or the trade-offs that would have to be made are so significant politically that it requires the head of state to make the trade-off.So we're saying OK, it's yours now. I know these leaders pretty well. I like them, I hope I can spend a fair amount of time with them doing many things, working on Karabakh over the next few months, but working on everything I need to do with Azerbaijan and Armenia. So I know I personally will have a lot of interaction with them. So it's not like we're going to sit on our hands and nothing is going to happen. And we're not saying here either that the negotiating process is dead forever. What we're saying is that we've taken this phase as far as we can and we need guidance now, or decisions from the heads of state. RFE/RL: It's been suggested that there are too many strong emotions to melt this frozen conflict. And that what is needed in the interim is a reduction of tensions, for instance Armenian troops pulling back from the territory around Karabakh. Would you advocate that? Bryza: It's sort of circular to say that an agreement wasn't reached because the time wasn't right or the tensions were too high. That is a statement of fact, yes. So then the question is how can we reduce tension, because everybody agrees it's good to reduce the tension. Would an Armenian troop pull-out reduce tension? Well, sure as hell it would. That's why it's a core element of our core principles. But the Armenians aren't just going to pull back the troops because we say, ""Golly, gee, that would help reduce tension."" They'll do it if they get something for it and that's precisely what these core principles are all about. RFE/RL: Is there anything you would like to identify that would be reciprocal to a removal of Armenian troops? Bryza: I would just point you to the statement.... It's very clear, and lays out in a lot of detail what exactly the overall set of trade-offs would be. Demilitarization is the phrase used for troop pull-back, and that, as the framework indicates, should be, or could be, accompanied by some sort of process that would lead to a population vote, or a referendum vote on the future status of Karabakh. I think that's, in the Armenian mindset, extremely important, so that's what the Azerbaijani side would have to offer the Armenians, along with the other things within this statement to which I refer you. On the Azerbaijani side, I think that they are willing to consider the possibility of some type of a vote on the status of Karabakh if many other elements of this overall package are present. What gets difficult is how you correlate the withdrawal, or the redeployment, of Armenian troops with the timing of a vote on the future status of Karabakh. RFE/RL: Will the issue of Karabakh or other frozen conflicts be on the agenda of the G8? Bryza: Well, I personally hope so, parochially. I saw that [Russian] Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov announced today that they will be. He said that, at least for the foreign ministers, that several of the G8 foreign ministers have pressed for Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Transdniester, to be on the G8 agenda. And he said because of that they will be. So I guess I can say, yeah, it appears they will be, and we have very much wanted all these conflicts to be on the agenda.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1069418.html,Caucasus US Says Aliyev Kocharian Must Show Political Will ,"June 23, 2006 17:56 GMT",,,"U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Mathew Bryza (file photo) (InterPressNews) PRAGUE, June 23, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Matthew Bryza, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, recently gained a second job title: he has replaced Steven Mann as the U.S. co-chair of the Minsk Group tasked by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with moderating negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Bryza spoke on June 22 with RFE/RL Armenian Service head Harry Tamrazian and RFE/RL Azerbaijani Service correspondent Kenan Aliyev about the prospects for a resolution of the Karabakh conflict, Russia's role in the South Caucasus, and America's strategic priorities in the region. RFE/RL: Your post -- deputy assistant secretary -- is more senior than those occupied by previous U.S. co-chairs of the Minsk Group. Does that mean the United States is paying more attention to the Karabakh question? Could that in turn mean that there is a sense the sides are coming closer to resolving this conflict? Matthew Bryza: I wouldn't read too much in particular into the fact that you now have a deputy assistant secretary, rather than someone who wasn't, doing this. A lot of this just depended on personalities and my own background. I've been so deeply involved in the region for a long time. It made sense that I would be the person to pick this up, because it was time for Ambassador Mann, coincidentally, to move on to his next assignment. So that's all. I wouldn't read anything more into it. I'm just very happy that I'll be able to play a more active -- and, in fact, daily -- role on this conflict and make sure those efforts are integrated with all the other broader things I'm trying to do in the Caucasus. ""We just don't know where the presidents are right now. We're encouraging them, we're nudging them by taking a step back. Nudging them to show that they have this political will."" RFE/RL: You have said in recent statements that there is a framework on the table that makes an agreement on Karabakh possible. You have also said that next year the political calendar will be more complicated in Armenia, and therefore the presidents should do something this year while there is still a window of opportunity. First of all, what kind of framework is that? And do you still believe there is room for a resolution this year? Some experts say the issue is already very complicated today, even before we get into the elections next year. Bryza: It is complicated today. We see how complicated the situation is based upon the fact that the presidents haven't gotten to the point where they've agreed to this framework that's on the table. That gets back to the first part of your question. What we have is a framework agreement, as we described today here at the OSCE -- as Ambassador Mann did, and Ambassador [Yury] Merzlyakov [the Russian co-chair] and Bernard [Fassier, the French co-chair] as well -- we have a framework agreement that would call for the removal, or the withdrawal, of Armenian troops from those territories in Azerbaijan where they currently are. That's on the one side. On the other side we have a normalization of Armenia's ties -- economic, diplomatic -- and other features having to do with peacekeepers and international economic assistance to the Karabakh region, and economic development. So there's a package proposal on the table that, in the end, would involve as well a vote at some point on the future status of Karabakh. So that's kind of the basic outline of the proposal on the table, and we would very much encourage the presidents to accept this framework. Which requires a lot of political courage, which I've said publicly before. A Breakthrough This Year? The Nagorno-Karabakh army conducts military exercises in 2005 (Photolur) RFE/RL: Have you noticed any sign that the two sides may be softening their positions? Did they appear more willing to consider the framework agreement you're describing during their talks in early June at a Black Sea summit in Bucharest than they were when they meant for talks in February with the French president in Rambouillet? Bryza: Put it this way: At Bucharest, they talked throughout the whole meeting to each other, really went through the issues in detail, and [they] haven't issued any negative statements really since. So I'm not sure how to interpret that. I know what I hope, what the co-chairs hope: The co-chairs hope that this reflects political will on the part of the presidents to really get serious about some tough compromises each side will make. I'm not sure if that's where they are, and the co-chairs talked today about taking a bit of a pause throughout the summer to find out whether or not the presidents do in fact have that sort of political will. RFE/RL: What is the next step for the co-chairs? Are you planning to bring the presidents together again after the summer? Bryza: At this point, as I was saying, the co-chairs have decided to take a pause throughout the summer. We will reconvene in September, October, to report back here [to Vienna, the headquarters of the OSCE], I hope. But we're taking some time off in terms of trying to facilitate meetings between the presidents. It's really up to the presidents now to decide whether or not they want to take the politically difficult and challenging decisions that are critical to bringing the framework agreement home. So we're giving them some space, and we want them to demonstrate that they really do have the political will to take these next difficult steps. That doesn't mean we're quitting the process. That doesn't mean we're walking away from it. I myself still have to make my first trips in this capacity to Yerevan and Baku, and you can bet that I'll be encouraging the presidents to take these tough decisions. And there will be opportunities at major international gatherings this summer to discuss this issue. RFE/RL: At the turn of the year, there were a lot of optimistic statements -- from you as well as others -- that the Karabakh conflict could be resolved in 2006. We're now halfway through the year. Are you still optimistic about 2006? Bryza: I don't know. My optimism, if you look carefully at my statements, was about the fact that there is a framework on the table that provides a workable foundation for a just and lasting settlement. I was optimistic that the Minsk Group negotiators had gotten the two presidents as close as they could get to an agreement without the presidents taking some very difficult decisions and making some very difficult compromises. We are still in that same place. I don't know if that's optimistic or pessimistic. But the Minsk Group itself has decided that there's no sense in us trying to arrange another round of presidential meetings or trying to broker an agreement, because we have taken the process as far as we can, and all that's left to do is for the presidents to make these tough decision. Is that pessimistic? I don't know if it is. It depends on what the presidents themselves decide to do next. If they decide that they simply don't have the political will to keep going, well, that's a pessimistic outcome. But we just don't know where the presidents are right now. We're encouraging them, we're nudging them by taking a step back. Nudging them to show that they have this political will. Russia's Role In The South Caucasus A Russian tank embarks at Batumi on the start of its journey out of Georgia (ITAR-TASS) RFE/RL: Russia does not always play what some would consider a constructive role in the South Caucasus, particularly with regard to the ""frozen conflicts"" in the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But Russia has been very cooperative with the United States on Nagorno-Karabakh. Some Russian officials, like Sergei Ivanov, have occasionally said there should be no Karabakh resolution imposed from abroad. But otherwise the relationship has been constructive. How would you evaluate relations between the United States and Russia with respect to Karabakh, in particular and the Caucasus, in general? Bryza: First, let me say you made a statement of fact with which I agree. We are working quite well with Russia on Karabakh. Our level of cooperation has not been as significant when it comes to South Ossetia and Abkhazia and Transdniester. I don't work on Transdniester [a separatist region of Moldova], but I was just in Abkhazia and I think there is a lot of room for much better cooperation -- and I would argue that the Georgian side has shown a significant amount of goodwill and a readiness to work on significant confidence-building measures. I would also say the United States has worked hard to keep the Georgians as constructive and moderate as possible, and I hope our Russians colleagues and friends will do the same in terms of encouraging the Abkhaz to be constructive and moderate. I saw today that [Sergei] Bagapsh, the leader of the authorities of Abkhazia, issued a rather incendiary statement, threatening to put mines along the Line of Contact between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. That's the last thing that needs to be happening right now. We don't see that happening in the case of Karabakh. I leave that to analysts like yourselves to figure out why that may be. Geographic differences, perhaps? Where Karabakh is placed? I don't know what the reason is. Maybe it's because the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan themselves have demonstrated a commitment to work in a constructive way -- although I would argue the Georgians have done so as well. But we are working quite well with the Russians, and especially with the Russian co-chair, Ambassador Merzlyakov. He's a creative and constructive diplomat whom I've known for a long time, ever since we worked together on Caspian energy issues. The U.S. Interest In Nagorno-Karabakh RFE/RL: Your predecessor, Ambassador Mann, said repeatedly that the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, created pressure to resolve the Karabakh conflict in order to put an end to one source of instability in the region. Even so, high-level involvement on the part of the United States has not materialized. How does Nagorno-Karabakh fit into U.S. security interests? Bryza: I think Steve [Mann] is right to say that any time we have an area that could become a gray area on the map, where nefarious transactions or transit of goods and materials could transpire because of legal grayness. That's a potential threat. Where does Karabakh fit into our broad national security calculus? Well, hopefully there will be a discussion of it at the G8 [summit of the eight leading industrialized nations, to be held in mid-July in St. Petersburg]. The G8, one could argue, may be the world's most elite grouping of states and political leaders. So if we have a discussion on Karabakh at the G8 -- along with a discussion of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transdniester -- that would imply it figures pretty prominently on our agenda. But we're still working out the agenda of the G8. RFE/RL: So it's not yet clear if Karabakh will be included? The ""Washington Post"" has reported that the Georgian and Moldovan conflicts would be discussed, but Karabakh will not be. Bryza: I don't believe that will be the case. We are working with our secretary of state -- we have already recommended to her that she raise all of those conflicts at the ministerial [meeting in Moscow on June 29]. Undersecretary [Nicholas] Burns has already made that suggestion a couple of times. And so we would like to make sure all of those conflicts are on the agenda. RFE/RL: There is always the lingering possibility that the conflict could resume. Both sides have made attempts to raise their military budgets. That is particularly the case with Azerbaijan. How would the international community react to either side attempting to shift the balance of power away from the status quo? Bryza: You've put me in that classic situation of having to answer a hypothetical question. So I won't answer that question directly. What I will say is what I've been working on with my friends in the government of Azerbaijan -- because that's the side where you most often hear those sorts of threats; that's a fact -- and what I feel the government of Azerbaijan doing as well is focusing on the positive aspects of Azerbaijan's burgeoning wealth that's going to come from the energy sector. It's really quite unhelpful to make statements that imply that this increased wealth is going to lead to purchases of arms and military threats. It's quite constructive, however, to talk about how this wealth can open new channels of cooperation, how such wealth would provide Azerbaijan an opportunity to invest in the well-being of the region, [how it could] help develop Karabakh, all the territories, create the opportunities for business, for commerce, and for the ethnic Armenians and Azeris to come together and get to know each other, and therefore, over time, to reduce the level of tension and the level of animosity surrounding the status question of Karabakh. So I guess what I'm saying is there's really no reason to expect that armed conflict will come out this. It's really unwise even to talk about it, and we urge the sides not even to think about it. The United States, The Caucasus, And Oil RFE/RL: The United States clearly has strategic interests in Azerbaijan, not least Caspian oil. Does the United States look at the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the context of its energy interests? Bryza: Throughout the Caucasus, we have three sets of strategic interests. These are valid in all three countries. Yes, we have energy interests, and we're not embarrassed to say that energy is a strategic interest. We have pure security interests, or traditional security interests -- meaning fighting terrorism, fighting proliferation, avoiding military conflict, and restoring (or preserving, in some cases) the territorial integrity of the states of the region. What I really mean is, resolving the conflicts, in the case of Georgia, within Georgia's international boundaries; in the case of Karabakh, our official line is we support Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. And then we have a third set of interests: in the internal reform of each country -- democratic and market economic reform, for all the reasons the [U.S.] president has articulated, based on our belief that stability only comes from legitimacy. And legitimacy requires democracy on the political side and prosperity on the economic side, and you only get both -- democracy and prosperity -- through serious reform. So all three sets of interests are being pursued by us at any one time. ""It's diversity we care about -- diversity of supply, which leads to energy independence."" In Armenia, obviously the significance of energy is not the same as in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is a producer. Keep in mind that we Americans will consume little if any of that energy produced in Azerbaijan. The energy produced in Azerbaijan matters in terms of its contribution to global energy diversity, especially for our European allies. So it's diversity we care about -- diversity of supply, which leads to energy independence. When it comes to Armenia, energy is similarly important in terms of making sure that Armenia has independent or multiple sources of energy supply so that it feels independent, and therefore more stable, and more willing to negotiate in good faith. So that's a long answer to say that of course energy is part of our strategic calculus. But that's not what's driving us. We're looking for balance. And we do recognize, however, that, God forbid, if there was a resumption of conflict [over Karabakh], that that would undermine the entire investment climate across the Caucasus, all three countries. And we certainly don't want that. Armenia And Regional Powers RFE/RL: The relationship between Turkey and Armenia, which is also crucial to regional stability, is slowly showing signs of improvement. Is the United States actively engaged in trying to help make ties between Ankara and Yerevan warmer? Bryza: We are working, consulting, talking, strategizing with our friends in both Turkey and in Armenia. When it comes to Armenia, I think it's clear that the Armenian side is willing and ready to move toward normalization. I think the same is true in Turkey. Besides just encouraging the sides to get together and find a common language, I can tell you that what we've tried to do over the last few years is try to develop this particular framework for Karabakh that's on the table. Because if the sides are able to implement what the framework indicates -- meaning, again, the withdrawal from the territories in Azerbaijan where Armenian troops are present, and then the normalization of diplomatic and economic relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia -- then full normalization of Turkish and Armenian relations follows naturally. Another way to put it is, all of our diplomatic efforts with regards to Karabakh also aim at normalizing Turkish and Armenian relations. RFE/RL: A question on the issue of Russian military bases in Armenia: Some military hardware was recently moved from Georgia to Armenia. There are essentially no Russian troops in Georgia and Azerbaijan, but there is a significant presence in Armenia. How does the United States view that? Will you ask the Armenian government to ask the Russians to withdraw? Bryza: First of all, let's be clear that there are Russian troops in Georgia. They have not all withdrawn yet from [military bases at] Akhalkalaki or Batumi. They are on the way, the heavy equipment is moving. And there will be Russian troops in the context of the CIS peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia for some time, depending on how the discussions go between Russia and Georgia. When it comes to the movement of the heavy equipment from Akhalkalaki to Gyumri [site of a Russian base in Armenia], no, we're not asking Armenia to press for the removal of those Russian bases. We didn't ask the Georgians to do that. We respect the sovereignty of our friends, be they Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Armenia, and it's up to those sovereign governments to take their own decisions. We simply welcome the fact that Russia and Georgia have agreed mutually that Russian bases will close down. That was Georgia's expressed ambition. Russia agreed. That's simply a good thing. But it's not for us to try to encourage the removal of the bases. Promoting Democracy One of many Azerbaijanis who claimed Novembers's parliamentary elections were rigged (ITAR-TASS) RFE/RL: Neither Azerbaijan nor Armenia have had truly democratic elections in the past 10 years. So can we say these governments have the mandate, the popular support, to make the difficult decisions outlined in the framework agreement? Bryza: Certainly they have the mandate if they build popular support. I think that's the most important next step. I've been talking about the fact that the presidents need to take tough decisions. And to get to the tough decision, they need to prepare their populations for a compromise. That's another way of saying they either build, or do have, that mandate. You raise a good question about the legitimacy of a government depending on its elections. I would argue that the pace of democracy in both of those countries isn't a disaster. A lot more work needs to be done. But in the case of Azerbaijan's [parliamentary] elections [in November 2005], there were some significant improvements in this last round of elections. But they didn't go as far as we would like. RFE/RL: How serious is the United States about promoting democracy in Azerbaijan? We see your serious efforts in Georgia, and we see the results. But in Azerbaijan, the international community seriously criticized the elections, but the United States decided to invite President Ilham Aliyev to Washington. What makes Aliyev different, for example, from an autocratic leader like Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka? Bryza: I categorically reject the statement that the United States isn't serious about democracy in Azerbaijan. As President Bush said in his second inaugural address, long-term security requires democracy. It's the thirst for political and economic freedom that is the most powerful motivating factor in international politics. That really is the source of long-term stability. We fool ourselves if we think that we can achieve our long-term interests in any country -- be they energy interests or security interests -- and turn away from democracy. You talked about September 11. Well, the great lesson we learned from September 11 is that we were wrong, as the president has said, for 50 years. We looked at the Middle East and said 'these countries are too strategically important for us to focus on democracy.' ""Just because Azerbaijan hasn't gone as far as we would like on democracy doesn't mean we're going to ignore our energy interests or our military interests."" So we understand that long-term security and therefore the ability to achieve our energy interests requires democracy. In Azerbaijan, we have pressed very hard on democracy. You said the international community was critical of the Azeri elections -- well, we're part of that community, and our statements were critical. However, we have to make a judgment at some point whether or not we think the trend in a country is positive or negative. And we don't have unidimensional relations with countries, either. I talked about three sets of interests. Just because Azerbaijan hasn't gone as far as we would like on democracy doesn't mean we're going to ignore our energy interests or our military interests. That's not to say that our energy interests or our military interests or our counterterrorism interests are driving us to ignore democracy. I said before, we have to pursue a balance. Why would we freeze out President Ilham Aliyev from contact with our president forever because we think he needs to do more on democracy? That doesn't make sense. Our president made a judgment. His judgment was that we could do more to elicit democratic reform in Azerbaijan by embracing Ilham Aliyev right now rather than freezing him out. That's because we do feel the trend on democracy is positive, even if Azerbaijan hasn't gone as far as we wish. So, finally, I'd say there is simply no similarity between Lukashenka and Aliyev. We just don't feel there is at all. Ilham Aliyev, we believe, is working to modernize the political system of Azerbaijan, to create democracy in the context of Azerbaijan's culture and traditions -- which the president said is necessary, because democracy looks different in every country. That said, they haven't gone far enough. And we will continue to press President Aliyev -- and his opposition as well -- to behave constructively, to build and strengthen democratic institutions as we pursue our full range of interests. RFE/RL: Ilham Aliyev has been to Washington; Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been invited to the White House just ahead of the G8. Are there any plans to invite Armenia's President Robert Kocharian as well? Bryza: We obviously don't look at balancing presidential meetings like that, but there's no reason not to want President Kocharian to come to Washington. Let me just say I hope we can see a similar series of positive steps on democratic reform in Armenia as we hope we are starting to see in Azerbaijan. Maybe we're wrong about Azerbaijan. Maybe we're overly hopeful. But we think things are moving in a positive direction. And we hope to see more of that from Armenia. We signaled our support for Armenia, quite dramatically, with the Millennium Challenge Account [a development fund set by the United States, whose recipients -- including Armenia -- are chosen using competitive, reform-based criteria]. That is, in many ways, one of our highest forms of stating that we seek a partnership with a country, to help it move forward on democratic reform. So we began that program this year. When we began it, we issued a letter saying we really had problems with the way the constitutional referendum was conducted in November [2005], and we're waiting to see positive changes implemented. So that's kind of the key to the next steps in our relationship.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1069083.html,NagornoKarabakh What Is The Sticking Point In The Peace Talks ,"June 12, 2006 12:00 GMT",,,"By Liz Fuller and Richard Giragosian http://gdb.rferl.org/56266752-4C22-4653-A152-093B8266A08D_w203.jpg Thousands of people were displaced after the fighting in the early 1990s (ITAR-TASS) On June 4 and 5, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, met in Bucharest on the sidelines of a forum of Black Sea states to resume talks under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to resolve the Karabakh conflict. But the Bucharest talks, like the two presidents' previous meeting in Rambouillet in early February, failed to make progress on resolving what Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian subsequently called the most serious difference between the two sides. All the officials involved in the search for a solution to the Karabakh conflict, whether representing the conflict sides or the mediators, have remained tight-lipped in recent months over the precise issues under discussion. That atmosphere of confidentiality has been alleviated only by occasional enigmatic statements and disclosures. But the intensification of the Minsk Group's efforts in the wake of the February talks in Rambouillet also reflects a growing sense of urgency. Upcoming ElectionsArmenia is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in 2007, and presidential elections are due in both countries in 2008. In the run-up to those elections, neither leadership dare agree to a humiliating concession that could alienate voters. For that reason, the Minsk Group co-chairs desperately want the two sides to agree on at least a preliminary draft accord before the perceived ""window of opportunity"" closes at the end of this year. While the notion of a ""window of opportunity"" is now in question, it does reflect a very real linkage between the peace talks and the electoral cycle of all parties involved. And that linkage in turn reveals the rather troubling failure of both the Armenian and Azerbaijani governments to adequately engage and prepare their societies for any possible settlement. Azerbaijani officials have repeatedly ruled out any solution that does not preserve the country's territorial integrity. They would therefore be reluctant to permit a referendum on the future status of the NKR in which the predominantly Armenian population would doubtless opt for independence. Indeed, the current constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic expressly precludes holding a referendum on altering the country's borders. A second disturbing factor is that the leadership of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) remains dangerously excluded from the top-level negotiations, relying instead on Armenian ""good faith"" and prudence to defend their interests. It seems only natural to presuppose at least a degree of divergence in the national interests of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. But notwithstanding ""windows of opportunity,"" the ongoing talks and meetings are important in themselves to maintaining a degree of dialogue and engagement, and in demonstrating to the population of both countries their respective leaders' commitment to resolving the conflict on the most advantageous terms possible. MeetingsAs noted above, two meetings within four months between Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev failed to yield progress on the most intractable difference between the two sides. ""The issue the two presidents discussed and tried to solve is very complicated indeed,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service quoted Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian as telling journalists in Yerevan on June 6. ""This was the same issue that was put before the presidents at Rambouillet. It wasn't solved then and it wasn't solved now either."" Kocharian (left) and Aliyev have met several times over the last year (Photolur) Noyan Tapan quoted Oskanian as implying that reconciling the two sides' respective positions is all the more difficult because it requires a retreat from fundamental principles. But he said he will very probably meet again ""very soon"" with his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov in a bid to narrow the differences between the two sides. Unconfirmed reports say such a meeting might take place as early as this week.Oskanian failed to identify the pivotal issue that is precluding progress in the peace process, but statements by other officials substantiate the hypothesis that the nexus of the problem lies in the concessions each side is, or is not, ready to make. Most analysts assume that the variant currently under discussion is that originally proposed in late 2004 by NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche and former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio. That plan envisages a compromise settlement that would give Armenia temporary control of the unrecognized NKR in exchange for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territory, with the final status of Karabakh to be determined by its inhabitants in a referendum in five or 10 years' time. The International Crisis Group unveiled a similar plan last fall.Solutions, ConcessionsThe major obstacle to either of those plans is that Azerbaijani officials have repeatedly ruled out any solution that does not preserve the country's territorial integrity. They would therefore be reluctant to permit a referendum on the future status of the NKR in which the predominantly Armenian population would doubtless opt for independence. Indeed, the current constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic expressly precludes holding a referendum on altering the country's borders. On June 6, ArmRadio.am, as cited by Groong, quoted Mammadyarov as stressing that point, and also as arguing that not only the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, but also its former Azerbaijani community, should be given autonomy under any peace settlement.As for Armenia, the real question is whether, when, and in return for what reciprocal concession from Azerbaijan it should relinquish its sole bargaining chip by withdrawing from the seven districts of Azerbaijan contiguous to the NKR that have been occupied by Karabakh Armenian forces since 1993. Yerevan reportedly has no objection to freeing five of those districts -- Jebrayil, Fizuli, Zangelan, Agdam and Gubadla -- but has been reluctant to cede control of the strategic Lachin corridor that serves as the sole overland road link between the NKR and Armenia, or the neighboring Kelbajar district. (Retaining such a lifeline is one of the three key tenets of the Armenian negotiating position.) U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Daniel Fried's comment in Bucharest on June 5 that ""we would like to see the return of as much territory as possible to Azerbaijan as soon as possible and the return of Azerbaijanis to their native villages"" implies precisely such a disagreement between the two sides over how many districts Armenia will cede and the time frame for doing so. And the Karabakh leadership may well take a harder line than Yerevan on any withdrawal from occupied territory, thereby narrowing the Armenian room for maneuver. In that respect, progress in resolving the conflict may ultimately hinge on the ability of the OSCE -- or the international community in general -- in providing long-term guarantees (in the form of an international peacekeeping force) of the security of both the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azerbaijanis who will be enabled to return to the villages in surrounding districts from which they fled in 1992-93.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1069032.html,South Caucasus EU Special Representative Hopeful On Karabakh ,"June 09, 2006 13:09 GMT",,,"By Hrair Tamrazian and Kenan Aliyev http://gdb.rferl.org/8D377E9F-BCDD-43A1-80E4-277347DF6FAC_w203.jpg Peter Semneby (Photolur) No progress was reported in the latest round of talks between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh. Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, meeting on the sidelines of the June 5 Black Sea Summit in Bucharest, conducted talks in what was deemed by observers a ""very good atmosphere,"" but with no resolution of who ultimately should control the ethnic-Armenian exclave located inside Azerbaijan. The so-called ""frozen conflicts"" of Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia are key issues for the South Caucasus -- and for officials like Swedish diplomat Peter Semneby, the new EU Special Representative for the region. RFE/RL spoke to Semneby in Bucharest on June 4. RFE/RL: What is your outlook on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict? Are you hopeful the issue will be resolved? Peter Semneby: I've been asked very often in the last few months whether I'm an optimist or a pessimist regarding Nagorno-Karabakh and relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I would say that I'm neither. I don't want to say that I'm an optimist, because so far it's always been the pessimists who have been proven right in this conflict. Still, one should always maintain hope, and I'm still hopeful that this conflict will be resolved soon. This is a very good moment for the region. It's a time when there are no major domestic considerations in the countries. It's also a time when the European Union is taking a much stronger interest in the region, something that is demonstrated by the inclusion of all of the Southern Caucasus countries into the European Neighborhood Policy. RFE/RL: The International Crisis Group recently came out with a report urging the EU to be more engaged in conflict resolution in the region because it has the best leverage there, both financially and institutionally. Do you agree that the EU should put a priority on this issue? Semneby: There is a lot that the European Union can do. The EU sent a political signal when it changed the mandate of the Special Representative, from a rather passive role in terms of conflict resolution to one where he is expected to contribute to conflict resolution. That change of wording may not change very much in practical terms, but it is an important political signal. 'What happens in the Southern Caucasus is no longer something abstract and distant. It is becoming an area of direct concern to the EU.' What is changing in practice are the resources and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal. When the European Neighborhood Policy starts to take effect with the new financial perspective of the European Union in 2007, there will be considerable resources available for various activities, not least those related to conflict resolution and support of the development and rehabilitation of the conflict areas. A young ethnic Armenian recruit being put through training in 1992 (TASS)Already, at this stage, if there is a resolution, if there is an agreement between the parties, there are considerable rapid-reaction funds that the EU can also put at the disposal of the two governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan to repair what has been broken by the conflict.RFE/RL: Nagorno-Karabakh isn't an easy conflict to resolve. Attempts so far have not been successful, and may continue to be unsuccessful for many years to come. Why has the EU decided that now is the time to become involved in conflict resolution? Semneby : The reasons why the EU is more interested now than in the past has to do, of course, with the change of the environment in which we are living. The European Union is enlarging. Very soon it will have two members bordering on the Black Sea, Romania and Bulgaria. The EU has started to negotiate for membership with Turkey. That changes the perspective. What happens in the Southern Caucasus is no longer something abstract and distant. It is becoming an area of direct concern to the EU. It's also an area that is important for energy resources. It's important because it's close to very volatile regions to the south. The Middle East, all the problems that we're facing with Iran also have focused attention on the Southern Caucasus. And it's also an important aspect of EU relations with our biggest and most important partner country in the East, and that is Russia. RFE/RL: In the EU-Russia summit in Sochi on May 25, the Caucasus reportedly figured in the discussions. What specifically did you talk about? Do you find there are instances where Russia is heavy-handed in its policy on this area, and if so, do you express your concern? Semneby: When the Caucasus is discussed with Russia, the three ""frozen conflicts"" that we have in the area are obviously high on the agenda. These conflicts -- in particular, the ones in Georgia -- are a direct issue in our relations with Russia. What I hope and believe is that we will be able to resolve the two conflicts in Georgia together with Russia, because I fundamentally believe that it is in Russia's interests to have stable neighbors along all its borders and neighbors with which it maintains predictable and friendly relations. And only when the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been resolved once and for all will the problematic relationship between Russia and Georgia become normal. RFE/RL: How much do you engage in dialogue with the South Caucasus governments on democracy issues? There are those in Azerbaijan, for example, who say that the EU and other Western powers aren't doing enough to remind the government of its commitment to promote democracy and respect human rights. How do you respond to such criticism? Nagorno-Karabakh army in training, 2005 (Photolur)Semneby: Fundamentally, we regard the countries in the South Caucasus as partners. And what you have to do with partners is you have to discuss the issues and you have to agree on what needs to be done. That takes some time, because our thinking has developed in different contexts, historically and otherwise. Through an intensive relationship over the course of the last few years, I do think that we have come to a common understanding of what the standards are that need to be fulfilled. The proof of that is that we have in fact agreed more or less on quite extensive Action Plans to implement the European Neighborhood Policy, which includes the most important parts of the EU acquis [communitaire, the European Union's body of laws], in terms of democracy, human rights, rule of law, and so on. This is the first step. We will have the Action Plans very soon. I'm convinced that the last parts of the negotiations will be done very soon and they will be signed. That marks a new step in our relations, when the focus will be on the implementation of those Action Plans. RFE/RL: The Council of Europe, for one, says Azerbaijan still has political prisoners -- a violation of Baku's international obligations. Some observers say the South Caucasus leaders are engaging with the West in order to stay in power, but aren't truly committed to democratic reforms. So what guarantee is there that these Action Plans will be signed? Semneby: I think that the EU has proven in other cases that it does have a considerable transformational power, and I very strongly believe that through the carrots and sticks that the EU will have at its disposal as part of the Action Plans that there will be such a transformational power in the Southern Caucasus. That is not to say it will be easy. We have seen many of the most difficult issues in other countries that have acceded to the European Union only being resolved at the very final stages. This is an issue -- since we don't have a membership perspective in the European Neighborhood Policy, one of the most important carrots is not present. But I think there are still enough instruments of the same kind that have been very successfully applied in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that can also be used in the South Caucasus.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1068631.html,Russia How Does Moscow View Frozen CIS Conflicts ,"May 24, 2006 13:50 GMT",,,"A Russian soldier holds a Chechen flag (file photo) (AFP) Russia appears to support the May 21 Montenegrin independence referendum as a potential model for resolving some separatist conflicts in its own neighborhood -- namely, the regions that enjoy Moscow's support in their pursuit of independence from Moldova and Georgia. But its own separatist conflicts are a different matter -- particularly in Chechnya, where no Montenegro-style referendum is likely. RFE/RL Moscow correspondent Claire Bigg asked Yevgeny Volk, the director of the Heritage Foundation think tank in Moscow, whether Russia has a double standard on the issue of separatist conflicts. RFE/RL: The Russian Foreign Ministry said on May 23 it respected Montenegro's vote to seek independence from Serbia. Abkhazia and Transdniester, two breakaway regions backed by Russia, have also hailed the historic poll as an inspiring model. Will Russia be tempted to apply the Montenegrin experience to Moscow-friendly frozen conflict regions? Yevgeny Volk: Tbilisi will certainly not allow referendums to be held in Abkhazia or in South Ossetia, and the international community will, of course, be on the Georgian government's side. If Russia tries to push for referendums, it will end up being isolated and neither the OSCE nor the UN will support its efforts. It is a very unlikely option because it represents a direct path to armed conflict. RFE/RL: Despite welcoming Montenegro's independence vote and urging the nation to engage in a ""constructive, good-willed, and wide-ranging dialogue"" with Serbia, Russia is very unlikely to sanction a similar referendum in Chechnya. Does this amount to a double standard? Volk: Russia supports referendums where it is advantageous, where it advances its own interests -- but in no circumstances inside the country, where such referendums could yield the most unexpected results, even despite massive control and manipulation of public opinion. RFE/RL: Is a similar referendum possible at all in Chechnya, and would it enjoy Western support like Montenegro's independence vote? Volk: Today, the issue of a referendum in Chechnya is purely hypothetical, so in this context it is too early to talk about the West's stance. Chechnya is now under total Russian control. In my opinion, even if such a referendum took place in Chechnya, its results would be known in advance since free and fair elections cannot be expected there",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1068628.html,CIS Can Referendums Resolve Frozen Conflicts ,"May 24, 2006 12:55 GMT",,,"A Ukrainian soldier patrols his country's border with Moldova's separatist Transdniester region (ITAR-TASS) On May 21, the tiny Balkan republic of Montenegro voted to dissolve its union with Serbia and become an independent state. This peaceful act of self-determination has potential significance for separatism-minded regions elsewhere. In the former Soviet Union, breakaway territories in Georgia and Moldova see Montenegro's quest for independence as a model for their own aspirations. PRAGUE, May 24, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Suddenly, everybody wants to be just like Montenegro. From Transdniester to South Ossetia to Abkhazia, separatist regions in the former Soviet Union are rushing to praise the Montenegrin independence vote -- and to hold it up as a model that they would like to follow. A 'Civilized' Model? Sergei Bagapsh, the president of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, praised what he called Montenegro's ""civilized"" method of gaining self-determination. Likewise, Yevgeny Shevchuk -- the speaker of separatist Transdniester's parliament -- told RFE/RL's Romania-Moldova Service that people there have the right to hold a similar vote -- if not for independence, then at least for autonomy: ""If we are going to proceed according to the principles of human rights and create conditions for a better life on the dignified level of Europeans in the 21st century, then we need to go down this path,"" Shevchuk said. ""We have a historic opportunity."" But there are big differences between Montenegro and these post-Soviet separatist regions. Montenegro's leadership enjoys wide legitimacy and the republic is considered a good international citizen. Moreover, Montenegro's independence referendum was held with clear rules under the watchful eye of the European Union and with Serbia's acquiescence. There were no serious fears of violence. The Threat Of Violence By contrast, the threat of unrest is never far off in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, whose relations with the Georgian government in Tbilisi are often openly hostile. Transdniester, likewise, has poor ties with Chisinau. And all three regions are widely viewed as lawless safe havens for smugglers and organized-crime groups. A Russian peacekeeper patrols the border between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia (TASS file photo)All three are also strongly supported by Russia, which has been accused of exploiting the conflicts to maintain leverage in its relations with pro-Western Georgia and Moldova. Georgia is working hard to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia back into its fold and resents what it sees as Russian meddling on its territory. In an interview with RFE/RL's Georgian Service, Irakli Menagarishvili, a former Georgian foreign minister and currently the head of the country's Center for Strategic Studies, warned the international community against applying the Montenegrin model to trouble spots in the former USSR. No Single Solution ""Drawing parallels here is not only unacceptable, but also dangerous,"" Menagarishvili said. ""Cases like these have their specific historical, political, and other dimensions. Hence each of them has to be considered and solved separately. Any attempt at generalization or universalization is, to repeat once again, not only unacceptable, but also dangerous."" One breakaway region in the former Soviet Union where an independence referendum proved problematic was the ethnic-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Many in Nagorno-Karabakh feel that residents of the region were punished for voting for independence in 1991 -- paying with their lives in the war that ensued. How Could Referendums Work? So, with all these differences, can Montenegro's smooth transition nevertheless serve as a model for resolving any of the stubborn frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union? Karel De Gucht, the OSCE's chairman in office, thinks it can -- but only if all sides agree in advance to respect the result. ""You can only have that kind of referendum if all parties agree about the referendum and agree about the outcome of the referendum,"" de Gucht said. ""That is why the proposal of the international community by Ambassador [Miroslav] Lajcak -- that you should have at least 55 percent of the people voting in favor [in Montenegro] -- was an important element, because it was also accepted by all parties concerned. A referendum where first of all the organization of, and, second, the result, the outcome, are not guaranteed beforehand can also be very divisive. So it can be a solution, provided that everybody agrees to accept the result."" Likewise, Alexander Rahr, an expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union at the German Council of Foreign Relations, said holding a referendum is the fairest and most democratic way to resolve such issues. But for independence votes to work, they must be held under free, fair, and open conditions -- circumstances that are conspicuously absent in Transdniester, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. Moreover, Rahr pointed out that Russia might try to manipulate the results of referendums in the pro-Moscow regions. ""In Montenegro, a referendum could be held in a real democratic way under the supervision of Western democratic institutions,"" Rahr said. ""That may not be the case in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, or Transdniester, where there is a fear these results could be forged and controlled by Russia."" For its part, Russia will likely be careful about pushing the Montenegro model too far. Citing Montenegro as a Western-endorsed precedent may suit the Kremlin's needs in Georgia and Moldova's separatist regions. But Moscow would be unlikely to endorse such a scenario on its own territory -- most notably, in Chechnya.",,,

He says he and his Orinats Yerkir party have now entered the ranks of the political opposition, with an eye on the country's legislative elections in May 2007. In an exclusive interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Baghdasarian discussed the withdrawal of his party from the ruling coalition and his political outlook for the year ahead. YEREVAN, May 23, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Some political rivals had suggested that Baghdasarian had made a critical misstep in breaking ranks with the government coalition. His resignation, after all, had prompted the withdrawal of between 15 and 20 members of his Orinats Yerkir (Law-Based) party -- all wealthy entrepreneurs with ties to President Robert Kocharian. A Vital Party But, Baghdasarian told RFE/RL his party has not lost strength. On the contrary, he called it ""the largest political organization in Armenia."" ""We enjoy quite weighty support inside the country and are understood outside it,"" he said. ""Forces sharing our values system are numerous, and we will continue to follow that path."" Submitting his formal resignation to fellow lawmakers in the National Assembly on May 22, Baghdasarian said there were two paths for Armenia to follow. He said the country can either be ""part of the Russia-Belarus Union and be on good terms with Europe, or it can be part of the European Union and be on good terms with Russia."" Orinats Yerkir, he said, has chosen the second path. Focus On Next Year's Elections Baghdasarian announced his intention to resign on May 12, but the formal tendering on May 22 puts in motion his party's preparations for its next political challenge -- the country's 2007 legislative elections. Baghdasarian said Orinats Yerkir has yet to decide whether it will join forces with anti-Kocharian political groups for that vote or go it alone. ""I don't rule out that Orinats Yerkir will contest the elections in an alliance,"" Baghdasarian said. ""But I don't rule out that Orinats Yerkir will contest the elections single-handedly either."" Some members of Armenia's political opposition have taken a sympathetic stance toward the outgoing parliament speaker, including Stepan Demirchian, the nominal leader of the nine-party Artarutiun (Justice) alliance, and former Prime Minister and Hanrapetutiun (Republic) party leader Aram Sarkisian. But other opposition members are openly distrustful of Baghdasarian, citing his long history of cooperation with Kocharian and his continued reluctance to oppose the Armenian president openly. Into The Opposition But Baghdasarian said he and his party are now firmly in the opposition, and will be vocal in their critique of the ruling powers. This includes Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian, who has been tapped as Kocharian's likely successor -- and a possible rival should Baghdasarian opt to seek the presidential post in elections in 2008: ""Yes, we are in opposition,"" Baghdasarian told RFE/RL. ""Within the framework of our ideas and programs, we will be criticizing both Serzh Sarkisian and Robert Kocharian and all those whose activities will be unacceptable to us. But that doesn't mean we must immediately start with personalized criticism."" It is still unclear what, precisely, led to the irreconcilable differences between Kocharian and Baghdasarian, whom the Armenian president went to great lengths to have elected as parliament speaker in 2003. Some analysts point to Baghdasarian's April 18 interview with a major German newspaper. In it, he called for Armenia's eventual accession to NATO -- a direct contradiction of Kocharian's standing policy. He also implied that Kocharian's reelection in 2003 was fraudulent.",,,

The report's findings were mixed regarding CIS states -- a catalogue of continuing abuses with some progress. Russia was lambasted for a rise in racially motivated killings. Belarus and Azerbaijan both received criticism for cracking down on opposition activists and politicians. And Ukraine and Georgia -- countries that have improved their democratic credentials since their colored revolutions -- were chastised for their records on police torture. PRAGUE, May 23, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- As Lamzar Samba, a student from Senegal, was leaving a popular St. Petersburg nightclub in April, he was killed by a gunshot to the neck. Russian police on May 22 detained five suspects over the killing. A sixth suspect was killed last week by police while allegedly resisting arrest. The attack on the student was one of a spate of racially motivated attacks in Russia in recent weeks. Rights watchers say such attacks are on the rise. Amnesty International's annual report notes that in 2005 in Russia there were at least 28 killings and 365 assaults motivated by racial hatred. Foreigners and Russian citizens from Chechnya and elsewhere in the North Caucasus have been the main targets. Backsliding In Russia Irene Khan, Amnesty's secretary-general, says there have been many other disturbing signs in Russia over the past year. ""We have seen the Russian government introducing restrictions against NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], clamping down on human rights defenders and journalists,"" Khan said. ""We have seen the Russian government totally ignore and refuse to take action against its own security forces in Chechnya, who have committed human rights abuses."" Amnesty's Irene Khan (AI/Dannenmiller)Russia's apparent backsliding on human rights has caused many observers to question the country's tenure as chair of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers and presidency of the Group of Eight (G8) leading industrialized nations. Judit Arenas, a senior spokeswoman for Amnesty, says Russia has taken some positive steps. She cites President Vladimir Putin's recognition of racism as a problem during his recent address to the nation. But she adds that Russia should do more and should set a leading example on the international stage. ""Russia actually blocked major resolutions at the UN Security Council on Darfur,"" Arenas said. ""It's got a major problem on its doorstep in Chechnya, which has not been resolved. There are other issues in the Caucasus and it has to lead by example and actually clearly demonstrate that if it wants to be a global player [then] it must actually abide by the rules of the game."" The Amnesty report criticizes Belarus and Azerbaijan for their violent crackdowns on opposition activists and journalists. In Armenia, despite commitments made to the Council of Europe, conscientious objectors to military service still remain in jail. Do 'Colored Revolutions' Make A Difference? But what of Ukraine and Georgia, two countries that have improved their democratic records since their recent ""colored revolutions""? The Amnesty report criticizes both countries for reports of torture and ill treatment by law-enforcement officers. Amnesty highlights reports that Georgian police have placed plastic bags over detainees' heads and beaten prisoners with gun butts. Georgian police responding to a prison riot in Tbilisi in March (InterPressNews)However, the report points out that in both Ukraine and Georgia, senior officials have begun to address the issue. In Ukraine, the new government after the 2004 Orange Revolution changed legislation to allow state officials to be charged with torture. And in Georgia, several high-ranking politicians have pledged to fight police abuse. There has also been more extensive monitoring of detention facilities. Arenas says Georgia has been willing to listen to recommendations and implement legal amendments. ""The problem has actually been that that message has actually not translated down to the level of law-enforcement officials, who are the ones who continue to torture and ill-treat people,"" Arenas added.

In the view of its authors, the proposed one-article draft bill is designed to complement a 2001 law that recognizes the 1915-17 mass killings as genocide. The single-sentence law reads that ""France publicly recognizes the Armenian genocide of 1915."" French parliamentarians at the time noted that the text was largely symbolic, since it did not allow for the prosecution of those who deny the 1915 massacre was genocide.The authors of the new draft bill seek to rectify that omission.If approved, the legislation could make contesting the veracity of Armenian genocide claims punishable by five years in jail, or a fine of 45,000 euros (approximately $58,000).France already has a law making it a crime to deny the Holocaust. That law, passed in 1972, was later expanded to cover other crimes against humanity as defined at the end of World War II.The present draft bill was co-authored by a group of Socialist legislators that includes Christophe Masse and Didier Migaud.Addressing the assembly, Masse said criminalizing the denial of the Armenian genocide would make victims of the Ottoman-era killings and the Holocaust equal before the law: ""By adopting this bill, the National Assembly would confirm its commitment to justice and democracy. By making this strong gesture, it will help ease the unhealthy rivalry that exists among victims of [various] genocides and that is fueled by their inequality before the law.""Migaud, in turn, argued that criminalizing Armenian genocide denial claims is a question of ethics.""After we recognized the [Armenian] genocide, could we possibly accept that its denial goes unpunished on our territory? By accepting that, wouldn't we relinquish our obligation to remember? Wouldn't we be a party to censorship? Wouldn't we, more simply, accept an official history that was written by those who refuse to recognize, not merely a historical reality, but also a [historical] truth?"" Migaud said.Historical OpinionMost Western historians agree that the death of at least 1 million Ottoman Armenians in 1915 and the years that followed was orchestrated by the war-time Young Turk government and was the result of a genocidal policy.Although a number of Young Turk officials were tried by Ottoman courts after the 1918 armistice for their participation in the Armenian massacres, modern Turkey's successive governments have persistently denied all genocide claims brought against their Ottoman predecessors.Turkish historians and officials argue that the 1915-17 Armenian massacres were the result of war operations and civil strife, not of a deliberate extermination policy. They also claim much fewer than 1 million Armenians were killed.The issue remains a taboo in today's Turkey -- and there, it is those who back the genocide claims who face criminal persecution. EU And TurkeyMany EU politicians insist that Turkey must recognize the Armenian genocide before it can join the European Union. As French parliamentarian Migaud put it, Ankara must follow in the tracks of other states and reconcile with its past. Yet, he said that does not mean Ankara should be held responsible for massacres that took place 90 years ago.""Does his draft law mean that we intend to hold Turkey responsible for the [Armenian] genocide? Certainly not. This is not a judgment on our part, but we would like to tell the Turks that a nation, a country does not become weaker when it recognizes its past,"" Migaud said.Turkey has warned that, if adopted, the proposed bill would harm its relations with France. Ankara voiced similar threats when the National Assembly debated its first Armenian genocide bill five years ago. However, the economic sanctions that followed that French vote were soon lifted and had no lasting impact on bilateral ties.Addressing the French parliament today, Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, however, argued that making the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime would harm France's interests.""If the [draft] presented to you today were to be adopted, it would be considered an unfriendly gesture by a vast majority of the Turkish people. This would inevitably have serious political consequences and weaken our influence not only in Turkey itself but also beyond, in the whole region,"" Douste-Blazy said. Douste-Blazy further argued that the legislation would -- if passed -- hamper the normalization of ties between Turkey and Armenia and even hinder international efforts to find a peaceful resolution of the 18-year-old Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.France co-chairs the Minsk Group of nations that has been mandated by the OSCE to help Armenians and Azeris -- who are Turkey's ethnic kin -- find a diplomatic solution to their territorial dispute.Referring to an earlier controversial parliamentary debate on France's colonial past, Douste-Blazy also urged legislators to not interfere with the work of historians: ""You then agreed that it was up to historians -- and historians alone -- to establish the truth on past events and shape our collective memory. It seems to me that by attempting to back away from this rule of common sense this assembly again runs the risk of seeing the legislator interfere in the writing of national history.""Douste-Blazy's plea prompted a swift response from the floor.Pro-government parliamentarian Roland Blum, who supports the draft bill, objected that neither Turkish government officials nor Turkish historians are ready to come to terms with their past.""Turkey has not relinquished its nationalism. It has not relinquished Turkism, which served as an ideology for [the 1915] ethnic cleansing. It has no plans to recognize the Armenian genocide, quite the contrary. In 2005, the Faculty of Medicine in Istanbul has asked [Germany] permission to repatriate the remains of Dr. Behaeddin Sakir, the ideologue of the genocide, so that they be officially reburied [in Turkey], probably next to Talat Pasha, the man who organized the [Armenian] genocide and who has his own mausoleum [there],"" Blum said.Blum was the last lawmaker to take the floor.Parliament Speaker Jean-Louis Debre, who opposes the draft, indefinitely adjourned the debate after only 45 minutes of discussion. The next hearings will reportedly not take place until this autumn at the earliest.",,,

EU officials told a Council of Europe hearing in Brussels today that the bloc's European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) would make a separate Stability Pact redundant. Representatives from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were also lukewarm in their support for the idea. The EU was expected to be the Stability Pact's chief sponsor. But now the project -- first floated by regional leaders at the 1999 Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- now appears defunct. Robert Liddell, a senior official with the EU's executive European Commission, told today's hearing -- held by the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe -- he does not consider the project an improvement on the EU's existing policy.""I don't see much difference between what people are talking about in the Stability Pact and what the ENP is offering,"" he said. ""If you then build in other aspects of the European Union policy, of [its] security strategy, and other aspects of the [EU] Common Foreign and Security Policy -- those may not be part of the ENP, exactly but they are flanking policies that lead to a total package from the European Union."" Liddell said the ENP already embodies a statement of the EU's desire for stability, good governance and economic reforms in the South Caucasus.Not The BalkansSpeaking on behalf the EU member states, the newly appointed special representative for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, discouraged parallels between the proposed pact and the successful, EU-backed Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe.Semneby said most progress made in the Balkan countries would not have been possible without the ""overwhelming incentive"" of EU membership -- something the South Caucasus countries don't have.""[An] EU membership perspective is not present in the Southern Caucasus, unlike the Balkans,"" he said. ""It is indeed the European membership perspective that has played the most important role in the Balkans in terms of reforms that have been undertaken.""Semneby also noted that the South Caucasus is a far more unstable region, with its lingering ""frozen conflicts"" and Russia's continued influence. Caspian Energy LinkBoth Semneby and Liddell indicated the EU also prefers to see the South Caucasus in a wider context. This is partly due to the active interest taken in the region by key countries such as the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. But the EU's evolving quest for energy security also plays an important role. Liddell said the EU views the Black Sea region as integrally linked to the Caspian Sea and energy reserves in Central Asia.The representatives of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan present at today's hearing appeared lukewarm at best in their support for the idea of a Stability Pact.Georgia's ambassador to the EU, Salome Samadashvili, said her country is keen to follow its own path toward integration with the EU and NATO, unencumbered by regional commitments.""We [Georgia] do see ourselves as the crucial link between the -- if you wish -- the more stable Black Sea region, and the Southern Caucasus, and we are ready to do what we can in order to strengthen stability in the region, strengthen regional cooperation,"" she said. ""However, as the Georgian government has mentioned many times, we will not be captive to any regional approach, and Georgian society will move forward steadily on the course which it has chosen [pursuing closer links with the EU and NATO].""Nagorno-Karabakh Prevents ProgressArmenia and Azerbaijan spoke in favor of a more regionally oriented view. However, both made cooperation conditional on progress in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.Varuzhan Nessissian, head of the Armenian Foreign Ministry's department for the OSCE, said his country sees mainly economic benefits in a possible Stability Pact. But, he said, Armenia's support to the project remains ""qualified,"" and will depend on its acceptance by other countries, as well as a promise of eventual EU membership.""We do believe in Armenia that such an arrangement is possible and workable if at least two preconditions are met,"" he said. ""First, there must be strong political will on the part of the countries in the region to enter into a long-term stability arrangement, notwithstanding existing problems between some of them. Second, as in the case of [the] Stability Pact for the Balkans, there should be some concrete and eventual European [membership] prospect in a reasonable time frame. With these two in place, the Stability Pact for the South Caucasus has a chance to happen.""Azerbaijan's ambassador to the EU, Arif Mammadarov, said Armenia's withdrawal from Azerbaijani territory is key to any prospects of regional cooperation.""Without [the] fundamental principle of respect for each other within our identified territories -- which are internationally recognized territories -- without this principle, without recognizing each other's houses, to be good neighbors is impossible,"" he said. ""The first principle is the recognition of the internationally recognized borders of each other.""Although the EU appears to have dashed hopes for a South Caucasus Stability Pact, its involvement in the region will grow significantly with the impending signature of ENP action plans with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1068352.html,Armenia Plane Crash Uncovers Rift Between Moscow And Yerevan ,"May 12, 2006 09:14 GMT",,,"Tail of crashed Armenian airliner in Sochi on May 3 (epa) PRAGUE, May 12, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Last week's fatal crash of an Armenian airliner near the Russian resort town of Sochi has revealed tensions in the usually warm relations between Yerevan and Moscow. Many in Armenia believe the crash -- the worst in Armenia's history, with 113 deaths -- was the result of poor recommendations by Russian air-traffic controllers. But such claims may only be the cover for deeper concerns about the impending advance of the Russian gas giant Gazprom and growing racism in Russia directed in part at natives of the Caucasus. Hmayak Hovhanisian, the chairman of the Armenian Association of Political Scientists, says it is too early to tell if the controversy will have a lasting impact on relations between the two countries.""It depends on how the investigation proceeds,"" he notes. ""If the black boxes aren't recovered and the real causes of the disaster aren't explained in a way that is clear for everyone, it will have a negative effect on Russian-Armenian relations.""Investigation OngoingRecovery work is continuing following the May 3 crash of the Armenian Airbus A320. So far divers have located fewer than half of the 113 victims, the vast majority of whom were Armenians. The concurrent investigation into the crash is ongoing as well, under the joint supervision of Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin and Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian. But so far few clues have been revealed about the probable cause of the crash. Without the black-box flight recorders, investigators lack critical information about the flight crew's actions in the moments before the plane nose-dived into the Black Sea off the Sochi coast. The lack of information has angered Armenians, who believe the pilot may have crashed after being told by Russian air-traffic controllers to resume preparation for landing despite poor weather conditions. Georgian air officials had earlier recommended the plane turn back. Armenians Suspicious Of Russia's RoleWhile observers like Hovhanisian note that the responsibility for final decisions ultimately rests with the pilot, and not the air-traffic controllers, many Armenians -- including those in the political opposition -- are concerned by Russia's role in the crash. They have also expressed doubt that an investigation led in part by Russia will be fully honest. A portrait of Vagan Abramyants hanging in the Moscow metro. Abramyants was murdered at the station on April 24 (epa)Russia and Armenia have long enjoyed strong strategic ties. Russia maintains a military base on Armenian soil, and the two countries are partner to a landmark treaty in which Moscow has committed itself to defend Armenia militarily in the event it is attacked from outside -- an apparent reference to its historic enemy, Turkey. It has also helped to prevent further outbreaks of violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Armenia has also remained a loyal member of both the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the CIS Collective Security Treaty. This is something that sets Armenia apart from its disgruntled South Caucasus neighbor Georgia, which has tense relations with Moscow and has threatened to withdraw from the CIS. But many Armenians remain resentful of Russia. This is due in part to what is viewed as mounting racism in Russia. Skinheads were believed to be behind the killing in April of a 17-year-old Armenian in Moscow. Energy WorriesMany Armenians also accuse Russia of seeking to monopolize the country's energy industry. Eduard Aghajanov, an independent political analyst in Yerevan, says Russia is not treating Armenia like an equal partner.""Many already don't believe that [Russia] is a ally, because the way Russia deals with Armenia in its foreign policy is not the way a strategic partner would behave,"" Aghajanov says. ""It's the way it would treat a vassal."" Armenia recently agreed to hand over a portion of its state energy assets to Russia's state-run gas giant Gazprom, in order to prevent a threat to double gas prices. Gazprom has raised natural-gas prices for nearly all of its CIS clients this year, but Armenia, due to its compliance, saw a hike of just 10 percent. Gazprom is now set to assume control of a major Armenian power plant, and may also obtain a controlling share of a planned Armenian-Iranian gas pipeline. The deal is expected to give Moscow near-total control over the Armenian energy sector. Observers in Russia are more sanguine about the deal. Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies, says Gazprom's policy in Armenia is no different than those in other countries. Makarenko says anti-Russian sentiment has recently become more ""fashionable"" in Yerevan. But on the whole, he adds, relations between Moscow and Yerevan can be held up as an ideal in the CIS neighborhood. ""Speaking objectively, Russia has fewer problems in relations with Armenia than with any other post-Soviet state,"" he says.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1068172.html,Analysis Will Armenian Parliament Speaker Quit Ruling Coalition ,"May 04, 2006 16:28 GMT",,,"Artur Baghdasarian speaking in France last month (epa) Armenian parliament speaker Artur Baghdasarian has publicly distanced himself from one of the key tenets of the country's foreign and security policy -- nonmembership of NATO -- hinting that his Orinats Yerkir (OY, Law-Based State) party may even pull out of the government over the issue. But some analysts question whether Baghdasarian, who is widely regarded as populist and opportunistic, would risk doing so with 12 months to go before the 2007 parliamentary elections. In an interview published in the daily ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"" (FAZ) on April 19, Baghdasarian affirmed that while Armenia has good relations with Russia, ""Armenia's future is the EU and NATO,"" and ""Russia must not block our way to Europe."" The Armenian leadership is not averse to close cooperation with either NATO or the EU: Armenia finalized an Individual Partnership Action Plan with NATO in December 2005, and is a participant in the EU's European Neighborhood Policy. But it draws the line at formal membership in either organization. President Robert Kocharian and Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian -- currently regarded as the most likely successor to Kocharian, whose second presidential terms expires in the spring of 2008 -- have both repeatedly said that close military cooperation with Russia is a more reliable guarantee of national security than NATO membership. Presidential Response Baghdasarian's statement incurred a swift and negative response from Kocharian, who told the independent Armenian daily ""Golos Armenii"" that ""Armenia is not going to join NATO,"" and does not aspire to EU membership, Noyan Tapan reported on April 27. Kocharian stressed that according to the Armenian Constitution, the president determines the country's foreign policy, adding that he expects an ""explanation"" from Baghdasarian. If Baghdasarian makes good on his threat to pull out of the government, he risks forfeiting the post of parliament speaker, together with the influence, opportunities, and media visibility it provides. But Baghdasarian made clear on May 2 that he will pull Orinats Yerkir out of the three-party government coalition rather than retract his statement of support for eventual NATO and EU membership. At the same time, he stressed that he sees NATO membership as a long-term, rather than immediate, goal. Coalition Partners Step Back Representatives of the other two coalition parties immediately distanced themselves from Baghdasarian's statement. Galust Sahakian, who heads the parliament faction of Prime Minister Andranik Markarian's Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), told journalists that the other coalition members do not share what he termed Baghdasarian's ""private view,"" Noyan Tapan reported. Vahan Hovannisian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation--Dashnaktsutiun (HHD) said Baghdasarian should have consulted the National Security Council, of which he is a member, before publicly commenting on foreign and security policy. A History Of Confrontation Baghdasarian's unequivocal expression of support for NATO and EU membership was not the first issue on which he has crossed swords with the HHK. Last month, he voted against the report submitted by the government to parliament on the 2001-03 privatization program. And in early 2005, he engaged in a bitter war of words with Prime Minister Markarian, responding to Markarian's criticism of his unilateral decision to create additional parliament committees by accusing the HHK of corruption and mismanagement. Kocharian intervened on that occasion, downplaying the dispute and denying that he planned to dismiss Markarian.And last December, Baghdasarian accused unspecified local officials of stuffing ballot boxes to boost the turnout figures in the November 29 referendum on a package of draft constitutional amendments.Other remarks by Baghdasarian in his ""FAZ"" interview may equally have been directed against Markarian. Baghdasarian characterized Armenian politics as a fight between the younger generation and an older generation that is unable to break free from a Soviet mind-set. A directory of Armenian parliament deputies published in 1996 gave Baghdasarian's date of birth as December 1965, which would make him 40; the official biography released on his appointment in June 2003 as parliament speaker said he was born in December 1968. Markarian is 54; it would not, however, be entirely fair to brand him as an archetypal Soviet-era relic, given that he joined a dissident movement in the 1960s, for which he was sentenced to two years in a Soviet prison camp.Baghdasarian also told the ""FAZ"" that he is in favor of ""peaceful reforms,"" and that all those who oppose such reforms indirectly contribute to revolutions, which are ""not the right way"" to bring about change in the 21st century. Baghdasarian's statement incurred a swift and negative response from Kocharian, who said ""Armenia is not going to join NATO"" and does not aspire to EU membership either. Kocharian added that he expects an ""explanation"" from Baghdasarian. ""We are fighting to ensure reforms continue, and for that to happen we need free elections in Armenia,"" he said. ""The people who still believe that they can falsify elections must realize that those times in Armenia are past."" He predicted that attempts to falsify the upcoming elections as blatantly as during previous ones would lead to ""very great changes."" Pre-Election Positioning? It is not clear, however, whether Baghdasarian's criticisms of the government to which his party belongs reflect a personal dislike of Markarian; whether he is simply hoping to capitalize on widespread popular dissatisfaction with the present leadership; or whether his expressed support for a pro-Western orientation was intended primarily to identify him in the minds of Western policymakers as a possible alternative to Sarkisian in the 2008 presidential ballot. Nor is it clear why he has risked defying Kocharian over the issue of NATO membership at this juncture, with 12 months to go before the next elections.If Baghdasarian makes good on his threat to pull out of the government, he risks forfeiting the post of parliament speaker, together with the influence, opportunities, and media visibility it provides. Moreover, doing so could split his parliament faction, which currently numbers 22 deputies: the opposition daily ""Haykakan zhamanak"" noted on April 14 that only seven of those deputies voted with Baghdasarian to reject the government report on privatization. On May 3, the same paper reported that the Armenian opposition has expressed support for Baghdasarian, and it predicted that Kocharian may retaliate by pressuring members of the OY parliament faction to defect. If that hypothesis is true, Baghdasarian may find himself forced into overt opposition sooner than he planned -- assuming he really does intend to break with the present leadership.",,,

The Airbus A320 crashed into the Black Sea in the early morning of May 3 en route to Sochi from the Armenian capital, Yerevan, killing everyone on board. An investigation is ongoing into the crash, which appears to be the result of poor weather conditions. PRAGUE, May 4, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry says a radio tracking signal from one of the aircraft's ""black box"" flight recorders has been detected on the bed of the Black Sea. Investigators are hoping the recorder could help determine what -- beyond rain and poor visibility -- may have contributed to the crash. The Armavia air company operating the flight says the pilot had originally turned back after being warned of poor weather by Georgian flight controllers. But the pilot reportedly then resumed course for Sochi after being advised by air traffic controllers in Russia that conditions had improved. It was after this second turn that the plane nosedived, crashing into the Black Sea and killing all 113 passengers on board. Gennady Shlyakhov, reporting for RFE/RL's Russian Service from Sochi, says there are no new theories about what might have caused the crash. ""There are no new explanations, and there likely won't be any until the commission [investigating the accident] here makes its conclusions,"" Shlyakhov said. ""It seems that the final conclusions will be made when the black boxes are recovered. Only they can give exact information about the technical characteristics of the flight, which will explain why this accident took place."" The investigation is being led by Russian Transportation Minister Igor Levitin and Armenian Defense Minister Serge Sargsian. Citing the role of its flight controllers in the incident, Georgia has also requested that its own officials participate in the investigation. Georgia's Navigation Service has reportedly handed over all its flight data to Armenian officials. Armavia has dismissed speculation that the crash was caused by either plane malfunction or pilot error. Prior to the Sochi crash, there had been 11 fatal A320 accidents since 1988, claiming 327 lives. However, the plane's high-technology design has raised questions about the ability of flight crews to handle it. Grieving relatives, meanwhile, have begun the grim task of lining up outside a Sochi morgue to identify bodies and body parts that have been recovered from the site of the crash. Most of the people on board the plane were Armenians, but there were also 26 Russian passport holders, one Ukrainian, and one Georgian. At least five of the passengers were children. Shlyakhov says approximately 50 bodies have been recovered, and 20 of them identified. ""Unfortunately, not all the bodies survived the crash intact,"" Shlyakhov said. ""What we have are fragments of those bodies and they are being taken to the medical examination bureau. Then they are photographed and the photographs are shown to the relatives."" Once victims are conclusively identified, they will be returned to Yerevan for burial. Shlyakhov says the first flight returning bodies for burial will depart from Sochi later today.

Bush has often said he intends to resolve the issue without the use of force, but he stresses that all his options are open, including the use of military force. Today, Bush repeated his desire for a peaceful solution.""We obviously talked about Iran,"" he said. ""I assured the president of my desire to solve this problem diplomatically and peacefully.""Bush didn't mention the military option. On April 26 in Washington, Aliyev said that if the United States decides an attack is necessary, it would have to carry it out without Azerbaijan's help, because Azerbaijan and Iran, which share a nearly 300-kilometer border, have a nonaggression treaty.But Aliyev said on April 26 and 28 that Azerbaijan remains a strategic partner with the United States, and a strong ally of Washington in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. After today's meeting, Aliyev said: ""We are allies in the war on terror. We have been from the very first day shoulder to shoulder with the United States in peacekeeping operations in various parts of the world, and we'll continue to contribute to the creation of peace and stability in the region.""Bush also praised Azerbaijan as a Muslim nation that is becoming increasingly comfortable with democracy. ""We talked about the need for the world to see a modern Muslim country that is able to provide for its citizens, that understands that democracy is the wave of the future,"" he said.Nagorno-Karabakh DeadlockAliyev and Bush also discussed Azerbaijan's continuing dispute with neighboring Armenia over the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, and Armenia's occupation of a large part of Azerbaijan after the war the two countries fought in 1992.Bush and Aliyev said little about their discussions on these matters. The Azerbaijani leader said only that he had informed Bush of ""the latest status of the negotiations [on Nagorno-Karabakh] and expressed my hope that a peaceful settlement of the conflict will happen and will serve the peace and stability in the whole region.""Talks on Nagorno-Karabakh have been in progress for more than a decade under the mediation of the so-called Minsk Group of nations comprising France, Russia, and the United States.",,,

(ITAR-TASS) U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns says the United States will press for the so-called frozen conflicts of the former Soviet Union -- Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transdniester -- to be included on the agenda of the summit of the Group of Eight (G8) leading industrialized economies in St. Petersburg in July. It will be the first time that the G8 has discussed the conflicts. The group is likely to focus on the apparently intractable dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh. PRAGUE, April 21, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- A flurry of diplomatic activity has reawakened hopes that an agreement on at least one of the ""frozen conflicts"" of the former Soviet Union may be within reach. Part of the optimism stems from growing international attention to the problems of the post-Soviet states. The decision of the United States to press for the inclusion of the frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transdniester on the St. Petersburg G8 summit agenda is a case in point. Armenia's foreign minister said that if Azerbaijan accepts the right of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to self-determination to be exercised at some time in the future, Armenia is prepared to move on other issues. International politics appears to be shifting, and energy seems to be at the heart of the matter -- energy combined with the increasingly robust foreign policies of Russia and Iran. As a major oil and gas exporter and a neighbor of Iran, Azerbaijan increasingly finds itself the focus of U.S. attention. With U.S.-Iranian relations continuing to worsen, few doubt that Iran and the possibility of sanctions will be on the agenda when Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev meets with U.S. President George Bush in Washington on April 28. Azerbaijan's Position But Aliyev may feel emboldened to ask for more in return. Brenda Shaffer, who is head of the Caspian Studies Department at the University of Harvard, thinks this is a good moment for Azerbaijan to link wider international concerns to the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. ""If there will be any sanctions regime on Iran and it's very clear that in any economic sanctions it will be very important the border with Azerbaijan [sic],"" Shaffer said. ""Clearly this will be on the agenda between Bush and President Aliyev and this will be the place for President Aliyev to say: OK, we're cooperating on international issues in such a way, we need international cooperation and fulfillment on Nagorno-Karabakh. I think there will be a good chance to make progress through this meeting."" This comes at a time too of growing fluidity in talks between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians. As Steven Mann, Washington's chief Karabakh negotiator, left Yerevan and traveled on to Baku, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that if Azerbaijan accepts the right of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to self-determination to be exercised at some time in the future, Armenia is prepared to move on such issues as Azerbaijani territories outside Karabakh occupied by Armenia, the return of refugees, and security guarantees. That provoked an unusually rapid and positive response from Azerbaijan. Oskanian's comments, it said, were constructive and demonstrated a commitment to actively take part in peace talks on the resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. A Topic For The G8 Agenda Shaffer believes the U.S. call to include the frozen conflicts on the agenda of the G8 summit strengthens Baku's hand even more. ""The idea that this will on the table during the G8 meetings in St Petersburg in July is an incredible opportunity for Azerbaijan and probably the Azerbaijani leadership is focusing on how, with all these geopolitical changes taking place, how to keep Nagorno-Karabakh on the international agenda and how to use these geopolitical changes in order to benefit the Azerbaijani stance on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,"" Shaffer said. The OSCE, which is mediating the peace talks, will also want to exploit the new fluidity in international politics. Ideally, it would like another summit to follow the disappointing meeting between Aliyev and Kocharian in February. But Yuriy Merzlyakov, who is Moscow's OSCE negotiator, is calling for patience. ""I think it would be premature to talk of an agreement,"" Merzlyakov said. ""We need to talk first to the ministers and we need to visit the region again. I think it would be desirable to wait until mid-May."" As a major oil and gas exporter and a neighbor of Iran, Azerbaijan increasingly finds itself the focus of U.S. attention. But it is not just Nagorno-Karabakh where there is sign of movement. The European Union -- which until recently has seemed too focused on its problems in the Balkans to contemplate the challenges of the Southern Caucasus and Moldova -- may be changing its position. The German paper ""Der Welt"" writes today that Chancellor Angela Merkel is planning to use a speech to the European Union parliament in early May to urge the development of a new eastern policy for Europe, which would put the Caucasus at the center of its focus. And it may not be alone. Washington too appears to be taking greater interest -- prompted perhaps by the need to protect its energy interests in the southern Caucasus and Russia's increasingly muscular assertion of its power in the region. On 4 May, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to confer unexpected significance on a meeting of the leaders of Black Sea and Baltic states by traveling to Vilnius to address their conference on the problems of the region.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1067662.html,Caucasus Frozen Conflicts Still Freezing Issue Of Missing People ,"April 14, 2006 09:22 GMT",,,"Ethnic Armenian soldiers during the war for Nagorno-Karabakh (file photo) (Photolur) Well over a decade after conflicts in the South Caucasus froze, the International Committee of the Red Cross says new cases of missing people continue to emerge. Significant progress will, it fears, have to wait for final peace agreements. PRAGUE, April 14, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Ethnic conflicts in the 1990s claimed tens of thousands of lives in the South Caucasus. Some 15 years later, many families are still searching for information about relatives who disappeared without a trace in the fighting. Groups like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are part of efforts to ascertain the fate of people who went missing in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. And this was one of the key issues on the agenda of the ICRC's president, Jakob Kellenberger, when he toured the South Caucasus between April 3 and April 9 to meet with the presidents and other senior officials of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to discuss humanitarian issues related to the region's so-called ""frozen conflicts."" Isabelle Barras, the ICRC's head of operations for Eastern Europe and a member of the ICRC delegation, spoke on her return to RFE/RL. RFE/RL: How many people are still unaccounted for from the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, where a fragile cease-fire has been in place since 1994? ""Fourteen years after the start of the conflict and 12 years after the signing of the cease-fire in this region, we are still opening cases."" Isabelle Barras: The figures are evolving, actually. It might sound a bit strange, but 14 years after the start of the conflict and 12 years after the signing of the cease-fire in this region, we are still opening cases. There are still families approaching the ICRC with old cases of people who have gone missing. And the figures that the authorities have and that the ICRC has collected directly from the families are not always the same. So far, as far as the ICRC is concerned, in relation with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, we have 3,750 total cases of people who have gone missing. That means Armenians, Azerbaijanis, and people from Nagorno-Karabakh, although the majority of them are Azerbaijanis. Those are the current figures. But again, we are opening new cases almost every day. RFE/RL: In addition to tracking data related to individual cases of missing persons, what other work is the ICRC doing on this issue? Barras: There is also some work that can be done with the families, some psychological support that can be offered. Unfortunately, in such matters, we have to work on the basis of the fact that most of the cases are people who have died. We know that one of the solutions might be that it will at some point be possible to proceed with exhumations. And then there will be all the identifications. This means that you have to get as much information as possible to make a link between human remains and a person in one of those cases. And that's a process that is going to start in the three countries. It has been done already partly in Georgia, and it will start in Azerbaijan and then in Armenia -- to collect that information and keep it and record it properly, so that at the moment of exhumation it will be useful for identification. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, at a treatment center for prisoners with tuberculosis in Azerbaijan (courtesy of the ICRC)RFE/RL: There is also the issue of prisoners of war (POWs) and of soldiers and civilians detained for crossing the Azerbaijani-Armenian border or violating the line of contact with Nagorno-Karabakh. Is the ICRC involved in securing the release of such POWs? And how many such cases are there? Barras: This is of course something that we have been doing for quite a long time. We do not have a population of prisoners of war we [have been visiting] for a long time, because usually they repatriate people quite quickly. And the ICRC is acting there as a neutral intermediary between both sides, and so has to organize the repatriation of the person, after, of course, having confirmed that he is willing to go back to his place of origin. Since the very beginning of this kind of activity, we have been involved in 656 such repatriations. Its not always a prisoner of war, of course -- sometimes it's a civilian person. This does happen also, that a civilian crosses the border -- sometimes by mistake, simply. RFE/RL: Kellenberger's trip also focused on Georgia's separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. What kinds of issues does the ICRC deal with there? Barras: The issue of missing persons is also one of the most important cases being followed by the ICRC in Georgia. The number of cases is a bit lower than in Armenia and Azerbaijan. We're speaking about around 2,000 persons who have gone missing. This is in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but the biggest number is concerning Abkhazia. RFE/RL: There is also the issue of the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the fighting between Georgian and separatist troops in 1992-93. Does the ICRC also work with issues of internally displaced people (IDPs)? Barras: We know there are discussions about the possible return of IDPs, more particularly in the region of Gali, between Abkhazia and western Georgia. This is something that we follow in terms of whether there is the possibility or necessity for us to be involved. If at one point this repatriation is organized, we would probably be ready to do something. But we are not part of the discussions about those returns. I know that it is more discussed with the United Nations system, and we follow that. But the ICRC is not directly part of those talks. RFE/RL: In the case of Abkhazia, communication between the two sides is said to be virtually nonexistent. The situation is hardly better in terms of Armenia and Azerbaijan in dealing with Nagorno-Karabakh. Is it possible for the ICRC to do its work in situation where there are few, if any, official negotiations on such politically delicate issues? Barras: I think it's important to understand that in relation to such a sensitive case, it's very rare that we can make significant progress in the absence of a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As you know, all the conflicts in this region are unsolved -- they are still ongoing, even if they're no longer in the acute phase. We are in situations that have not been solved politically. And this is definitely very difficult, in the absence of a peace settlement, to have concrete progress. But nevertheless there are a lot of things that can be done in order to prepare the ground for when there will be a possibility to go ahead with a more concrete solution. RFE/RL: Russia has a significant influence in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia, something that has angered officials in Tbilisi and decreased the likelihood of a settlement anytime soon. Does the ICRC deal with Russia when it comes to its work in those two separatist regions? Barras: Our main discussions on what we are doing in Abkhazia and South Ossetia would definitely be with the Georgian government.",,,

Oskanian's three-day visit will cover a wide range of issues, but the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process is expected to top the agenda during discussions with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on April 7. Yerevan and Baku have been at war over the territory since 1988, and efforts by international mediators to resolve the dispute have had mixed results. RFE/RL's Armenian Service spoke with Russia's top negotiator, Minsk Group co-chairman Yury Merzlyakov, about the peace process ahead of the Armenian foreign minister's arrival. PRAGUE, April 6, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- On the eve of the Oskanian's visit, the Russian Foreign Ministry reminded Yerevan and Baku that they must find a ""mutually acceptable solution"" to their 18-year dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. In comments made on April 4, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said Moscow ""favors the continuation of Armenian-Azerbaijani dialogue, first of all between both countries' presidents."" Face To Face Robert Kocharian of Armenia and Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan last met in February in Rambouillet, near Paris. Their meeting was initially viewed as a positive step by France, the United States, and Russia -- the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of nations that mediates in the conflict on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But although the summit extended over two days, the talks lasted just over six hours and ended inconclusively. And statements made by the Azerbaijani president in the wake of the head-to-head meeting have fuelled speculation that the negotiation process reached a new stalemate. International mediators insist the failure of the Rambouillet summit does not mean that the peace process is at a deadlock. Addressing an Azeri world congress in Baku on March 16, Aliyev threatened to withdraw from the peace talks unless -- as he put it -- Armenia stops ""dragging its feet."" ""We have been holding peace talks for the last 12 years,"" Aliyev said. ""For 12 years, we've had a cease-fire regime and held talks with the hope that they would bear fruit. But, how long is it going to last? This process cannot last forever. The patience of the Azerbaijani people and of the Azerbaijani government is running out."" Bold Statements Aliyev also told the congress that Azerbaijan's annual defense spending, which currently stands at $600 million, would continue to increase until it matches Armenia's entire state budget. Aliyev and his late father, who rules post-Soviet Azerbaijan for a decade, have made such statements in the past, threatening to forcibly recapture all territories that have been occupied by ethnic Armenian forces since 1993 if diplomacy fails. International mediators insist the failure of the Rambouillet summit does not mean that the peace process is at a deadlock. However, as Russian Minsk Group co-chairman Yury Merzlyakov says, the clock is ticking for the sides to strike a compromise. ""It is pretty unusual that the peace process should not be influenced by elections. A new election cycle is expected to start in 2007 and it will last approximately three years,"" Merzlyakov said. ""In other words, there will be elections in one or the other country [during that period]. We know by experience that any election slows down the peace process as it happened in 2003 [when there were presidential polls in Azerbaijan]. Sometimes, it even brings it to a halt for quite some time."" Serious Consequences In comments made to RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service in the wake of the Rambouillet summit, Merzlyakov's U.S. counterpart was even more candid. According to Steven Mann, failure to reach an agreement this year would have most serious consequences. ""There has been so much positive work that has been done in the past two years,"" Mann said. ""The window is right and necessary to reach an agreement. So it will be a true tragedy if the sides do not take advantage of this opportunity."" French President Jacques Chirac (right) greets Armenian President Robert Kocharian at the Elysee Palace in Paris, January 2006 (epa)The inconclusiveness of the Rambouillet talks has triggered renewed Karabakh-related diplomatic activity. The Minsk Group co-chairs met twice last month -- in Washington and in Istanbul -- to assess the outcome of the summit. Both Oskanian and Azerbaijan's Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov held separate consultations with U.S. officials in Washington. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov is expected in the U.S. capital within days for talks that could pave the way for Aliyev's visit later this month. Room For Success Yet, Merzlyakov makes it clear no breakthrough is possible without the two presidents being personally involved. ""Everything depends on both objective reasons and subjective factors,"" Merzlyakov said. ""It looks like all objective conditions [for a breakthrough] are here. But we have to take into account the subjective aspects of the issue, which are the [political] will of both parties and their readiness to prepare their public opinions with a view to solving this conflict peacefully. With this respect there is still a lot or work to be done."" In the Russian ambassador's words, the best way to give the peace process a new impetus would be for the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents to meet face to face again. But he says this prospect looks rather slim at the moment. ""We must now find opportunities to revive the process, including [through] contacts between the co-chairs and the presidents and [through] new meetings -- rather a new meeting -- between the two presidents so that they could continue discussing,"" Merzlyakov said. ""But we're now in a rather delicate phase and we haven't even started discussing [that possibility]. It's even difficult to talk to the parties about that because there is no international meeting scheduled [in the near future] that both two presidents could attend."" As for the prospect of Kocharian and Aliyev holding a new summit, the Russian envoy makes it clear international mediators would rather concentrate their efforts on keeping the peace process alive through shuttle diplomacy and separate talks with the presidents. ""After Rambouillet, perhaps we should reverse to the old system,"" Merzlyakov said. (RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service correspondent Kenan Aliyev contributed to this report)",,,

The deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus was identified among wild birds in the same area last month. It's thought all three victims came from the same family and it is the first time humans have died from bird flu in Azerbaijan. There are also public fears of an epidemic in Georgia. PRAGUE, March 14, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The government of Azerbaijan is fighting to hold back a wave of panic following the March 13 announcement that three people from the same family in the Salyan region on the Caspian coast had died of bird flu. ""Based on the tests undertaken by the World Health Organization, the Health Ministry of Azerbaijan has confirmed the diagnosis of bird flu in the three people concerned,"" said ministry spokeswoman Samaya Mamedova. Mamedova said tests on six other people from the same region had proved negative. The ministry appears to have wasted no time in making the announcement, but still faces an uphill battle to convince a skeptical public that the situation is not worse than officially announced. Flu Symptoms On Rise Health Minister Oktai Shiraliev revealed on March 13 that more than 100 people had been admitted to one hospital alone in Baku with symptoms similar to those of bird flu. However, epidemiological tests have shown that H5N1 was not the cause.Azerbaijan's population has little trust in government. If panic spreads, the country's clinics and hospitals could be overwhelmed. When bird flu was first reported in Azerbaijan in February, the government threw a three-kilometer sanitary cordon around the affected area and culled thousands of domestic poultry. The government also says that it is spending $39 million on an information campaign and preventative measures to ensure against the spread of the deadly virus. Public Panic That may not be enough, though, to reassure a population that has little trust in government. If panic spreads, the country's clinics and hospitals could well be overwhelmed. Neighboring Georgia and Armenia face similar problems. As in Azerbaijan, it is common practice for families in rural areas to keep poultry at home. It is almost impossible to prevent them coming into contact with wild birds. So far, neither Georgia nor Armenia has recorded instances of bird flu in humans, but fear of the virus is widespread. On March 13, the Georgian Health Ministry reported that some 140 people had come to the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases hospital following the death of two schoolgirls from pneumonia. The National Center for the Control of Disease said the deaths provoked panic in the city. 'No Epidemic Of Any Kind' Davit Meskhishvili, a senior official at the Georgian Health Ministry, called a press conference to stress that there was no cause for fear. ""I want to rule out 100 percent that there is any kind of epidemic of the type that has been under discussion recently,"" Meskhishvili said. ""This is just gossip and no more. There is no epidemic of any kind either in [Tbilisi] or in the country at large."" The Georgian Health Ministry said influenza viruses were commonplace in the spring and that just three years ago it had been forced to close down schools in the capital because of a particularly virulent strain. That may be true. But the difficulty lies in convincing a population that has so little trust in the ways of government.",,,

Supporters say Georgia has much to offer potential investors in the areas of energy, transport, communications, and banking. Georgian officials hope 2006 will bring close to $500 million in foreign direct investment. NEW YORK, March 3, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- John Waters is vice president of American-owned Cascade Capital Holdings, which until recently has focused its investment in energy, construction, and media projects in Armenia. But now Cascade Capital is setting its sights on Georgia. The firm paid some $5 million in December 2005 to purchase the country's Emporiki Bank from its previous Greek owner. Waters tells RFE/RL that 80 percent of Armenia's international trade passes through Georgia, and it simply made sense for Cascade Capital to set down roots there as well. ""Georgia is doing a great job of opening up its economy and its government and its future to integrating with Europe and more intense democratic standards,"" Waters says. ""We want to see Armenia tied as closely as it can be to Georgia for purposes of trade, for purposes of transport, and others."" Testing Georgia's Business Climate The conference's Georgian and American hosts had hoped to attract as many as 200 potential investors to the three-day event. Georgian government officials appeared at times to outnumber curious entrepreneurs at the conference. But some participants said they had already ventured into Georgian investment, and found the business climate to be promising. Raymond Davis is the president of HealthMax International, an Internet health-advisory enterprise that is now looking to expand into the traditional medicine and drug trade in Georgia. He says his investment this year will be relatively modest -- no more than $1 million -- but may grow to $5 million in the next two to three years. 'There's a little problem with the attitude of the people... We're very driven here [in the United States], and over there they have, let's say, a more balanced life. They don't see the urgency for finishing things at a certain time.' Looking for investment opportunities in the former Soviet Union, Davis said, his company focused on Georgia and Ukraine -- countries where the so-called ""colored revolutions"" had created more favorable business conditions. But even Georgia, with its numerous regional conflicts and uneasy relations with Russia, continues to prevent challenges to outside investors. For now, Davis says, HealthMax has limited its operations to the capital Tbilisi. ""Stability issues are important to us. With the Republic of Georgia, you can see that they're fighting to get the stability that they want, and there are certain regions that we will be avoiding until the situation with Russia settles down a little more,"" Davis says. ""But there seems to be -- for example, in the capital Tbilisi, and that's where we're going into to start with -- this vibrancy and stability that [allow] for us to start that process."" Slow Start, Many Challenges Georgian officials have said they hope initiatives like the New York conference will bring in a half-billion dollars in foreign direct investment this year. Georgia saw that level of investment once before -- in 2004, the year the massive Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline project was launched. But investment in Georgia is a slow process, often hampered by basic shortcomings in infrastructure. James Muir, the president of Muir Marketing Communications, is currently consulting an American firm working to improve the efficiency of Georgia's electricity-bill collection. ""The reason electricity doesn't work in Georgia is because it's a very old, Soviet system, and all the duplicate parts have been stolen, and it's just deteriorating all the time,"" says Muir. ""The only way to have good electricity in the regions, outside Tbilisi, is to replace it. The only way to replace it is to get investment. The only way to get someone to invest in it is to westernize it -- have good collections, have good accounting systems."" A Diference In Attitudes Muir says another problem in doing business in Georgia -- as well as in many former Soviet countries -- is the sometimes lackadaisical outlook of its workforce. ""There's a little problem with the attitude of the people. In a place like New York, people are living to work, let's say. And over there, people are working to live,"" says Muir. ""Their priorities are not the same, a deadline is not the same thing. We're very driven here [in the United States], and over there they have, let's say, a more balanced life. They don't see the urgency for finishing things at a certain time. And if one of your suppliers sees the urgency, perhaps the other one doesn't see the urgency."" The Georgia investment conference in New York is the latest in a string of similar events aimed to promote opportunities for American investors in the countries from the former communist Europe. Past investment gatherings have focused on Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania.",,,

The law now requires all public and private institutions -- including bars and restaurants -- to allow smoking only in allocated areas. But that doesn't seem to be stopping many Armenians lighting up where they shouldn't. In such a heavy-smoking country, is there anything the authorities can do to enforce the measures? PRAGUE, March 3, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- At least inside Armenia's parliament building in Yerevan, the new restrictions appear to be working. Special smoking areas have been set aside in the corners of the main lobby and canteen. Hakob Hakobian, one of the few non-smoking members of the assembly, welcomed the change. ""It's very bad when a smoker smokes near a non-smoker,"" he says.But opposition deputy Vazgen Manukian, puffing away on a cigarette, is not impressed""I was categorically against that law. Everything was perfect in Armenia and the state had to ban smoking. The countries that have banned smoking have better social conditions for their people, there are more freedoms,"" Manukian says. ""These countries were already democratic countries and they started thinking about their health. There couldn't be a more stupid decision in this disastrous country, where people are still dying from hunger, than to ban smoking."" Law In Force Last YearThe law officially came into force in March 2005. Its first phase banned smoking in hospitals, cultural and educational institutions, and on public transport. It was touted as a government drive to curb tobacco use in the country. The additional restrictions, effective from March 1, 2006 (Wednesday), mark the start of the campaign's second phase and require all public and private institutions -- including bars and restaurants -- to allow smoking only in special secluded areas.Despite the ban, it seems that Armenians are smoking as much as ever. And that's a lot. According to World Health Organization statistics, 63.7 percent of Armenian men are smokers -- the highest rate in Europe. Armenian women smoke far less, with some estimates putting the number at around 3 percent of the female population.Lack Of Punitive MeasuresEven many officials admit that -- for now at least -- the ban will be hard to enforce. Hranush Hakobian, a senior parliamentarian and the main author of the anti-smoking law, is candid about this: ""To say that we have achieved a lot of success would be wrong. But at least this law has had a lot of public resonance.""Observers say that the measures have so far been largely ineffectual because of the absence of any legal sanctions against those who violate them. Many restaurant and cafe owners are not even aware of the new requirements. But Hakobian thinks the restrictions are a good start. ""We must now think about the next step. Legal entities violating the law must face sanctions,"" she says.The deputy pledged to push for amendments to the law that would introduce hefty fines for unremitting smokers. Smoking bans -- some small-scale and voluntary, others government-sponsored -- have spread throughout the world in recent years, largely due to increased awareness about the dangers of passive smoking. Many smokers, however, argue that the bans are a violation of their rights. (RFE/RL Armenian Service correspondent Ruzanna Khachatrian contributed to this report)",,,

The optimism, however, was unfounded as international mediators said that no substantial progress was made during the talks. In recent days, hopes of moving forward in the peace talks have been dashed further as a war of words has escalated between Armenia and Azerbaijan. PRAGUE, March 3, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- In an television interview on March 2, Armenian President Robert Kocharian hinted that he was prepared to recognize the disputed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. But he said that would only happen if Azerbaijan opts out of further negotiations or launches a new military offensive: ""But if the moment arrives, when Azerbaijan indeed unequivocally says that the time is right for them, that they have to strengthen their army and in the future will solve the Karabakh issue by force, then our steps should be as followed: firstly, de jure recognition of Nagorno-Karabkah by the Republic of Armenia.""In the interview, which was carried by three national television channels, Kocharian added that further steps could be taken in strengthening the Armenian-occupied military zone around Karabakh and deeper integration with the Karabakh republic in the security sphere. Successive Armenian leaderships have traditionally shied away from recognizing Karabakh and have said that Yerevan will not be the first to do so.Three-Way Talks?Kocharian also said that he believes that the Karabakh leadership should be involved in peace negotiations: ""We have to try to engage Nagorno-Karabakh more actively in the negotiation process. Of course the best option would have been if the president of Azerbaijan, president of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the president of Armenia sat down around the negotiating table and if Nagorno-Karabakh would be represented by legitimate authorities.""The inclusion of the Karabakh leadership in the peace talks has long been a source of contention. Speaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service on February 18, Arkady Ghukasian, the president of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic, said that in the event that no progress is made in the peace talks, the Karabakh leadership might seek to pressure Armenia to recognize the republic as an independent state. President Kocharian's comments on March 2 come one day after strong words from his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev. Speaking in the town of Banofshala, a small part of Nagorno-Karabakh still controlled by Azerbaijan, Aliyev said that talks with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh are at a ""dead end."" He also said that ""Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijani land"" and ""We must free Nagorno-Karabakh, no matter what it takes.""The Azerbaijani president was in the region visiting camps for Azerbaijani displaced persons who fled their homes during the Karabakh war. According to RFE/RL Caucasus analyst Liz Fuller, both Aliyev and Defense Minister Safar Abiyev have repeatedly hinted in the past that Azerbaijan might resort to a new war to bring Karabakh back under its control. But Fuller said that Aliyev's recent comments may have been intended as much as a gesture of solidarity with the displaced persons as a statement of intent to go to war.Armenian forces control most of Karabakh and some of its surrounding areas. The enclave's status remains unresolved since the three sides -- Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabkah Republic -- ended three years of fighting and signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire in May 1994. During the fighting, about 600,000 Azeris were displaced and as many as 25,000 people were killed. Others put the number of displaced persons as much higher.Paris MeetingIn the run-up to the February summit in Rambouillet, diplomats had expressed guarded optimism that progress would be likely during the talks. Kocharian and Aliyev met face-to-face on February 10-11. But the talks were widely touted as a disappointment. In a statement issued at the end of the summit, the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of nations -- mandated by the OSCE to mediate a solution to the conflict since 1992 -- said the discussions were ""intensive,"" but provided no breakthrough.The American co-chair of the group, Ambassador Steven Mann, talked to RFE/RL's Armenian and Azerbaijani Services after the summit: ""The full range of issues were discussed. There were, I think, good personal atmospherics between the two presidents and the discussions did not result in a substantial change of the positions that the parties have held for months.""Some observers are concerned about the military buildup in both countries -- and its potential impact on the peace process. Both sides have increased defense spending in 2006. The Minsk Group of Russian, French, and U.S. mediators is set to meet in Washington in early March to formulate the framework of future negotiations.",,,

Russia has offered to act as a guarantor of peace in the event of the two sides reaching a compromise on the disputed territory. The visit also highlights the nuanced approach of Moscow to the three South Caucasus states. While Russia is in a state of almost perpetual tension with Georgia, the Kremlin's relations with Azerbaijan have been more fluid. Putin will be looking to draw Azerbaijan back into Russia's orbit after a decade in which the oil-rich state has set its sights on Europe and NATO. PRAGUE, 21 February 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Vladimir Putin flies into Azerbaijan today, confident that relations with Azerbaijan have shown signs of picking up. Trade has never been so good, topping $1 billion last year for the first time. He will be hopeful, too, of finding common ground with President Ilham Aliyev, who was stung by Western criticism of the conduct of the November 2005 parliamentary elections. Putin, however, congratulated Aliyev on the outcome.This optimism is all in marked contrast to Moscow's approach to Georgia, which the Kremlin and the Russian media continue to depict as incorrigibly pro-Western and aggressively anti-Russian.That, on one level, appears somewhat contradictory. Azerbaijan has been at least as pro-Western as Georgia in the last decade and has certainly done more than Georgia to break Moscow's geostrategic grip on the region. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, built with U.S. backing and soon to be followed by the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, has vastly increased the economic independence of both Azerbaijan and Georgia.Wiser With Experience?How then to explain the rather more subtle approach of Russian diplomacy to Azerbaijan? Aleksandre Rondeli of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies believes Moscow may have learnt lessons from its Georgian experience. Azerbaijan still sees Russia as Armenia's ally in the dispute over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.""Such were the methods used by Russia against Georgia that right from the beginning they backed themselves into a corner,"" Rondeli says. ""In fact, they used military methods: force and blackmail. And, as a consequence, they find they have no flexibility of action. And the main result is that they now have this hard, relentless opposition in the form of President [Mikheil] Saakashvili and his team."" In other words, the Kremlin has learnt from its Georgian mistake and is adopting a less hostile approach in its dealings with Azerbaijan. That's certainly one explanation. Vafa Guluzade has another. Guluzade was foreign-policy adviser to Heydar Aliyev, the late president of Azerbaijan and father of Ilham Aliyev, and remains a close observer of Moscow's relations with the South Caucasus states.""Georgia is much more independent from Russia than Azerbaijan because Georgia is saying the truth to Russia's face but we are not saying it,"" Guluzade says. ""We [Azerbaijan] are not saying to Russia that 'you are occupying our territory, get out from our territory, it is not Armenia.' Georgia is fighting for its rights. We are not fighting for our rights. That's why Russia is very happy with us."" Seeing Through The Lens Of The PastIt's an explanation that suggests too the restrictions on any hope for improvement in Moscow's relations with Baku. The apparently insurmountable obstacle remains that Azerbaijan still sees Russia as Armenia's ally in the dispute over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani soldiers in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1992 (AFP)When Guluzade says Russia is occupying Azerbaijani territory, what he means is that, like many Azerbaijanis, he sees Armenia as a proxy of Russia in the region -- and Armenia is still occupying seven Azerbaijani regions surrounding Karabakh. So for all the improvements in trade relations, Guluzade says Azerbaijan should remain wary of Russia. ""Russia is able to offer Azerbaijan nothing because Russia doesn't want Azerbaijan to be strong, to be independent and to escape from occupation of its territory,"" he adds. ""Russia is able to propose some support maybe in the liberation of one or two regions but the price is very big: it is the independence of Azerbaijan."" Which suggests that despite the growing refinement of Moscow's diplomacy towards Baku, its foreign policy in Azerbaijan, as in Georgia, remains the prisoner of decisions and policies adopted in the 1990s following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Rightly or wrongly, Azerbaijanis, like Georgians, see Russia as a former colonial power that has not yet abandoned its colonial instincts. Putin would like Azerbaijan to accept Russian troops as peacekeepers in and around Karabakh in the event of a peace deal with Armenia. He's not likely to get much encouragement for that in Baku. Suspicions of Russia's support for Armenia aside, Azerbaijan will not want to repeat the Georgian experience in its breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where Georgia accuses Russian peacekeepers of supporting the Abkhaz and Ossetians. And despite all the improvements in Russia's trade with Azerbaijan, Aliyev will not want to do anything to undermine his burgeoning relationship with the West. Oil and gas are the twin props of Azerbaijani independence and they need Western markets.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1066008.html,ArmeniaAzerbaijan Karabakh Wants To Be In On Settlement Talks ,"February 21, 2006 15:50 GMT",,,"Arkady Ghukasian (file photo) (epa) In an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service on 18 February, Arkady Ghukasian, president of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), said that Baku's refusal to hold direct talks with members of the Karabakh leadership is slowing down mediation efforts on the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Ghukasian construed Azerbaijan's rejection of such direct talks as reflecting a lack of interest in reaching a negotiated solution. ""The negotiating process that was going on within the Minsk Group framework is non-existent today...."" he told RFR/RL. ""We can find a way out of this situation only in a real negotiating format involving Nagorno-Karabakh.... When Azerbaijan talks only to Armenia without Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan engages only in propaganda. Once Azerbaijan starts talking to Karabakh, for me it will be a signal that Azerbaijan is looking for a solution to the issue."" Nagorno-Karabakh, a region within Azerbaijan, is predominantly ethnic Armenian. Following the unilateral 1991 declaration of Nagorno-Karabakh's independence from Azerbaijan, hitherto sporadic fighting escalated into a full-fledged war in which Armenian forces took control of swathes of neighboring Azerbaijani territory. The three sides -- Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic -- signed a cease-fire agreement in May 1994. The Minsk Group was created in 1992 to mediate a solution to the conflict, and Nagorno-Karabakh representatives regularly participated in talks with Armenia and Azerbaijan under its aegis until 1996. But following the appointment of then NKR President Robert Kocharian as Armenian Prime Minister in early 1997, the enclave was excluded from such talks. Push To Open Up Negotiations Ghukasian, who was elected Kocharian's successor in 1997, told RFE/RL on 18 February that he sees only one way to change that: Armenia should opt out of further talks and let Stepanakert make its own case with Baku. ""There is only one way Karabakh can enter the negotiating process: Armenia's refusal to negotiate with Azerbaijan,"" Ghukasian said. ""There is no other way out. As long as Armenia talks to Azerbaijan without [the involvement of] Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan will refuse to negotiate with Karabakh. It's as simple as that."" Armenian officials have repeatedly called for the inclusion of Karabakh representatives in talks under the Minsk Group aegis, but have not shown any sign of willingness to relinquish their role in the peace process. At the same time, Ghukasian acknowledged that tactic is not without risks. Azerbaijan might be tempted to take advantage of the Armenian refusal either to delay a settlement indefinitely or to launch a military campaign to bring Karabakh back under its control. Azerbaijan has doubled and even trebled military spending in recent years, and senior officials, including President Ilham Aliyev and Defense Minister Colonel General Safar Abiyev, have repeatedly hinted that if negotiations fail to yield a settlement on Baku's terms, Azerbaijan would be justified in resorting to arms. Armenian officials, for their part, have repeatedly called for the inclusion of Karabakh representatives in talks under the Minsk Group aegis, but have not shown any sign of willingness to relinquish their role in the peace process. Resolution Hopes The Minsk Group co-chairs said in December 2005 and January 2006 that talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in 2005 yielded progress towards a solution to the conflict, and hinted that 2006 might bring a major breakthrough. Armenia's Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev met earlier this month in France (AFP) Those predictions raised hopes that at their summit in Rambouillet, France on 10-11 February, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Kocharian and Aliyev, might actually sign a short declaration of basic principles that would serve as the foundation for a more detailed and comprehensive settlement. In the event, the two presidents failed to do so. A diplomat involved in the talks later told RFE/RL that the two key sticking points are Karabakh's future status and the timeframe for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan's Kelbacar district, which lies between the NKR and the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. Independence Recognition Ghukasian suggested that in the event that no progress is made in the peace talks, the Karabakh leadership might seek to pressure the Armenian leadership to recognize the NKR as an independent state. ""I think that if all goes on like this, if we see that Azerbaijan is really unprepared for concessions we will have to raise the issue of Armenia's recognition of Karabakh,"" he said. Successive Armenian leaderships have insisted that Yerevan will not be the first state to acknowledge Karabakh's independence, although it would follow suit immediately after another state sets the precedent. The Karabakh leadership's claims to independence derive from a referendum held in November 1991 in accordance with Soviet legislation still in force at that time that granted autonomous formations the same theoretical right to secede from the union republics of which they were a part that the union republics enjoyed vis-a-vis the USSR. Ghukasian's interview coincided almost to the day with the 20 February 1988 appeal by the local Soviet of the then Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast to the USSR Supreme Soviet to designate the region part of the Armenian Soviet republic. It was that appeal that served as the catalyst for a conflict that has lasted 18 years, and has polarized the populations of Armenia and Azerbaijan. On 18 February -- the day of Gukasian's interview -- the online daily echo-az.com reported that some Azerbaijanis now support the idea of building a ""great wall"" along the border between the two countries -- not so much for defense, but as a reminder to future generations of Armenia's ""aggression"" and ""inherent hostility.""

Talks between the EU and Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan on the action plan for closer links drag on. Meanwhile, no breakthroughs have materialized in the region's ""frozen conflicts"" -- in fact, in Georgia, tensions related to South Ossetia appear to be on the increase. BRUSSELS, 20 February 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The neighborhood policy action plans and the ""frozen conflicts"" in the South Caucasus were top of commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's agenda. Yet officials in Brussels have said after the visit that there was no tangible progress to report on either issue. Emma Udwin, Ferrero-Waldner's spokeswoman, said the commissioner urged the three countries to continue with the ongoing ""good consultations"" on the ""action plans."" The plans will lay out the guidelines for the three countries on building closer relations with the EU over the next five years. The action plans were initially to be concluded late last year. Udwin told RFE/RL today that the delay does not mean anything is amiss: ""The action plans are moving very swiftly and very effectively. There was one round at the end of last year, we're about to embark on the second round in early March. And we hope that second round will go as well as the first, with a view to rapid conclusions of the consultation process."" However, Udwin refused to put a deadline on the talks. Azerbaijan-Cyprus Dispute Drags On EU sources have told RFE/RL that talks are being held up largely because of a long-running feud involving Azerbaijan and Cyprus. Cyprus, an EU member state, wants Azerbaijan to rule out any future commercial flights to Northern Cyprus, which it contests with Turkey. EU officials say only one such flight took place last year. However, efforts at finding a solution that simultaneously satisfies Cyprus and allows Azerbaijan to save face vis-a-vis its close ally Turkey have not brought success. Officials say it is unlikely Georgia and Armenia will see their action plans approved before the issue is resolved to Cyprus's satisfaction. Spokeswoman Udwin said other, substantive issues were holding up the conclusion of action plan talks, but confirmed Cyprus's approval is needed. ""This is not at this moment a stumbling block. It is of course the case that when texts have been approved they have to be approved unanimously by the [EU] council of foreign affairs ministers,"" she said. ""In other words, [that] unanimously means that any one single member state can decide to bloc the approval of those texts."" Rambouillet Meeting Positive Ferrero-Waldner's visit took place after the inconclusive talks at Rambouillet in France between the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents on 10-11 February. The talks mostly focused on the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The EU has said it stands ready to assist the rehabilitation of Karabakh, but not before a peace settlement is in place. Fighting in Karabakh in 1989 (Photolur)Udwin told RFE/RL today the EU views the outcome of the Rambouillet meeting in a positive light. ""I think that although the press reports of Rambouillet struck a rather gloomy note, it was heartening to see that the two sides themselves are still committed to keep working and regarded the meeting at Rambouillet not as the end of the process but as a step in the process."" Udwin said Ferrero-Waldner had been keen to tell all three governments in the South Caucasus that resolving their ""frozen conflicts"" is essential if they are to be able to move closer to the EU. ""We stressed very much the message that regional stability is essential if each of those three countries are to draw the full potential of the [EU] Neighborhood [Policy] action plans,"" Udwin said. ""The countries concerned will not be able to take full advantage of the neighborhood policy unless 'frozen conflicts' are resolved and that is just one more reason why it's important for all sides to make all possible efforts to find compromises, to find solutions."" Udwin said that there is also an ""obvious need"" for regional cooperation in the South Caucasus in the fields of energy and transportation. She said the commissioner had said it is in the countries' own interests to work together. One EU official, who asked not to be named, said the EU is increasingly concerned over the possibility that Georgia might resort to force in the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Last week, the Georgian Parliament adopted a declaration asking for the departure of the Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia. The EU will today name Peter Semneby, a Swedish diplomat, as its new special representative to the South Caucasus.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1065648.html,NagornoKarabakh Peace May Depend On Military Situation ,"February 10, 2006 16:39 GMT",,,"Azerbaijani forces have been used primarily to control political demonstrations in recent years (file photo) (AFP) As the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia prepared for a summit on 10-11 February that could yield a significant breakthrough in the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, the challenge of securing any peace agreement will undoubtedly depend partly on the military situation on the ground. And with the necessary considerations of withdrawal, demilitarization, and peacekeeping, the American military presence in the region may hold a key to hopes for durable and lasting security. The region has been subject to a global shift of the geopolitical landscape in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and one of the most dynamic aspects of this shift has been the direct engagement -- and presence -- of the U.S. military. For the first time in history, the United States is now operationally active in each of the three countries of the South Caucasus. As with a number of other distant regions and countries, geographic isolation no longer meant strategic marginalization in terms of U.S. military policy and planning. Pivot Point Although the establishment of a cease-fire agreement in May 1994 effectively ""fixed and froze"" the conflict sides, the U.S. military presence may actually be a dynamic force in thawing the frozen conflict into an intensified jockeying for position by both sides. Yet the backdrop of undeclared war and unresolved conflict remains the core obstacle to long-term development and integration, together with longstanding regional blockades and embargos of trade, transport, and energy. Even more disruptive, however, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue still defines and deforms the political parameters in both Azerbaijan and Armenia. However, the U.S. military and security mission in Azerbaijan may yet emerge as a pivotal starting point for lasting regional stabilization. Although Georgia is in many ways the ""center of gravity"" for the U.S. military in the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan offers unique considerations for America's war on terrorism. Azerbaijan's strategic importance has been redefined, far surpassing Washington's earlier overemphasis on oil and gas pipelines to reflect a much more sophisticated agenda. It may also include greater American responsibility, however, as any progress in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks will most likely bring new demands and expectations from both sides. The military architecture of the U.S. presence in Azerbaijan is also rooted in the new, post-11 September 2001 strategy of moving away from a large ""footprint"" and relying on formal military bases to smaller forward operating locations, or ""lily pads."" In Azerbaijan, the U.S. military favored the establishment of even smaller and less visible ""cooperative security locations,"" tactical facilities with pre-positioned stocks that provide contingency access. With such locations in place, U.S forces could achieve greater mobility and facilitate faster and more effective missions either along Azerbaijan's southern border with Iran or its northern borders with Georgia and Daghestan. Pillars Of The Relationship The U.S. military also expanded bilateral relations with Azerbaijan. This military-to-military relationship blossomed after the U.S. Congress altered its prohibition on most U.S. government-to-government aid to Azerbaijan until it ends ""blockades and other offensive use of force against Armenia."" That prohibition, enacted into law in 1992 as Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, was modified in 2002 to allow for an annual presidential waiver to allow for a significant expansion of U.S. military and security assistance. Currently, there are four essential pillars of U.S. military interests in Azerbaijan, comprising broad areas of security driven by the new demands of waging a global war on terror. The first two focus on the general goals of fostering regional stability and security and forging cooperative assistance in countering terrorism. The third and fourth pillars comprise countering the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons and maintaining access to the Caucasus air corridor, which is essential for projecting power into Central Asia and Afghanistan. To accomplish these goals, the U.S. military's European Command (EUCOM) has launched several initiatives, focusing both on the region as a whole and on Azerbaijan specifically. A regional initiative, the South Caucasus Clearinghouse, emulates the Baltic model of establishing a new forum ""to serve as a multinational forum for interested countries to share information on their security-assistance programs for Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan; to de-conflict those programs; and to determine areas in which to collaborate or cooperate,"" according to a EUCOM statement. A second initiative, tailored to reflect both Azerbaijan's unique security needs and its linkage to Central Asia, consists of a three-pronged effort of counterproliferation, counterterrorism, and hydrocarbon security. This effort, the so-called Caspian Guard, was launched in 2003 and involves Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and focuses on maritime and border security in the Caspian Sea region. The Caspian Guard incorporates integrated airspace and maritime surveillance, control, and command. It also encourages greater coordination and cooperation in crisis-response efforts by the Azerbaijani and Kazakh naval forces. The effort was further bolstered in July 2004 by a $20 million program to provide training and equipment for Azerbaijan's Maritime Border Guard. Specialized tactical training and combined exercises are also provided by U.S. Special Operations Forces. Russian Response This Caspian initiative has prompted a Russian reaction. Last week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minster Sergei Ivanov called for the creation of a Russian-centered Caspian naval force. This Russian initiative, although mimicking the well-established U.S. effort, seeks to outflank the Caspian Guard by including Iran and Turkmenistan. But the real significance of the Russian proposal is its clear challenge to U.S. military ties with Baku. And this challenge may yet prove effective, as the Azerbaijani response remains unclear, suggesting a bid to pressure the Americans, to please the Russians, or even to exploit both. But in light of the opportunities inherent in these sophisticated initiatives, not to mention the assistance garnered from membership of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, how has the Azerbaijani military benefited from the U.S. military engagement? Ironically, the Azerbaijani armed forces have seen only a limited set of meager results. Despite a massive increase in defense spending and an even mightier chorus of bellicose statements from the Azerbaijani leadership, the military remains seriously neglected. Increased Western and U.S. training and military education for Azerbaijani officers is stymied by a system of promotion and assignment governed more by personal ties than by professional merit. Even impressive experience in overseas peacekeeping deployments in Kosova, Afghanistan, and Iraq go unrecognized upon return to Azerbaijan. In terms of military policy, any deepening of ties with the United States or NATO is seen as secondary to the more strategic need to expand military relations with Russia, both to respond to Armenia's position as a key Russian ally and to maintain Azerbaijan's arsenal of Soviet-era weaponry. Formidable Obstacles There are, moreover, two entrenched obstacles to military reform in Azerbaijan. First, the Azerbaijani armed forces face an unseen enemy: institutionalized corruption. With a combination of the Defense Ministry, a long-serving center of state corruption, and the defense minster himself, the longest-serving defense minister in the former Soviet Union, real reform has never taken hold. This is a legacy of President Ilham Aliyev's father, the cunning former KGB General and late President Heydar Aliyev, who saw the military as the only true threat to his power. The second obstacle, which has become increasingly visible in recent months, is perhaps the most challenging -- namely, the politicization of the military. Despite its repeated threats of renewed war to retake Nagorno-Karabakh militarily, the Azerbaijani leadership, whose lack of legitimacy in the eyes of the population constitutes a dangerous vulnerability, still fears a strong military. This vulnerability has been exacerbated by the regime's fearful observation of political change in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. The Azerbaijani perspective sees the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as a political -- not a military -- issue and a source of nationalist credentials deemed essential as the most effective way to ensure regime survival.",,,

According to sources close to the negotiators, the differences are narrowing between the two sides on a framework agreement on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The rough gist of this appears to be a two-stage process, the first of which would entail the withdrawal of Armenian-backed forces from the occupied territories around Karabakh and their replacement by international peacekeepers. And then at a much later date, a referendum would be held to determine Nagorno-Karabakh's political status. PRAGUE, 8 February 2006 (RFE/RL) -- It was the first inter-state war on the territory of the former Soviet Union and remains one of its most miserable. In three bitter years, the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh consumed the lives of 25,000 people, turned more than a million into refugees, and devastated the economies of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Today, 12 years after a ceasefire that froze the fighting but settled nothing, the entire region is paying the social and economic consequences. But there is a glimmer of hope, as the diplomatic marathon may be bearing fruit. There is talk of a potential deal. In an interview with RFE/RL last week, the U.S. co-chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Minsk Group, Stephen Mann, said the peace process was moving in the right direction. The OSCE Minsk Group has been mediating the Karabakh peace talks since 1994. ""All of us recognize that we are at the stage where we have to turn the corner from negotiations to decision. Speaking from the American perspective, we believe that the possibility for a deal exists in the months ahead,"" Mann said. ""So I think the meetings that are coming up are a very important opportunity. We do not want the sides to fail to take advantage of this important opportunity.""Change In ApproachThe guarded optimism, it seems, stems from a shift in the Armenian position away from insistence on a package approach to the Karabakh problems, whereby all issues, including the final status of Karabakh, should be solved simultaneously. By all accounts, Yerevan is now prepared to accept a step-by-step approach. Tom de Waal, an expert on the Caucasus, who is in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, for the Russian-language launch of his book on the conflict, ""Black Garden,"" thinks this has encouraged Azerbaijan to be more flexible.""The expectation here is that something will happen in Paris on Friday but that it will probably be just some kind of declaration -- maybe a declaration of basic principles and obviously there are some fairly serious negotiations going on. I think, talking to people in the Foreign Ministry that the tone has changed. They are talking much more constructively, much more in detail about things than they were a couple of years ago,"" de Waal said. But how much room does either side have for maneuver? Both sides have encouraged their respective societies to demonize the other. And Azerbaijanis have become accustomed to think that time is on their side, that their booming oil revenues will alter the military balance in their favor. Paata Zakareishvili, a Georgian specialist on conflict resolution who has just returned from a series of meetings in Armenia and Azerbaijan, thinks that the biggest problem in both countries is the failure of governments to prepare people for compromise. ""People's minds are completely closed. Society is not informed at all. Here [in Georgia], for instance, we're always talking about the federal solution or some other concept or other and this prepares the public for something to happen in Abkhazia. We're always discussing something. But there, there is no discussion whatsoever of concepts, proposals, and plans. All they discuss are Armenia's interests on the one hand and Azerbaijan's on the other,"" Zakareishvili said. It's a view shared by de Waal, who fears that the failure of the leaders of both countries to prepare and educate their peoples is storing up problems for the future: ""The leaders in private have been having quite detailed confidential discussions about a compromise and society is still stuck in the early 1990s and late 1980s and still stuck with a very aggressive rhetoric towards the other. In that sense, the leaders have become trapped. Even if they make an agreement, it'll be very hard for them to sell it and they'll be quite vulnerable and I think this is where things will get difficult."" For the moment, the flame of hope still flickers in the corridors of the OSCE offices in Vienna. Not so in the refugee camps of Azerbaijan, where it has long since been extinguished. For the hundreds of thousands of people expelled from Karabakh and the adjoining territories by Armenian forces in 1994, life has stood still these last 12 years. Untouched by the oil wealth that has come to Azerbaijan, these refugees still harbor the dream of return to their homes. Perhaps this week in Paris the leaders of both sides will make the first faltering steps to a compromise that might one day make that possible.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1065318.html,Caucasus Georgia Armenia Consider Options After Russia Pipeline Explosions ,"February 01, 2006 15:10 GMT",,,"Construction of a pipeline in Azerbaijan (AFP) Russia has repaired its damaged pipeline to Georgia and Armenia but the political and economic reverberations continue to be felt. Georgia's already fraught relationship with its powerful northern neighbor has taken yet another turn for the worse after a series of heated diplomatic exchanges. But more dramatically perhaps, Georgia has been forced to turn to Iran for help. For the first time in 30 years, it is again receiving Iranian gas. How does the United States see this development and will the row with Moscow persuade Georgia to diversify its energy sources on a permanent basis? And what of Armenia, the other victim of the pipeline explosions? There are many in Yerevan who are now calling for a review of the special relationship with Moscow. PRAGUE, 2 February 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The bitterness that runs through Russian-Georgian relations was again on vivid public display at President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin press conference on 30 January. Asked by a Georgian journalist whether the recent pipeline explosions in Russia that cut off the gas supply to Georgia were part of an energy war against Tbilisi, Putin criticized the Georgian government. The problem, he said, was that certain political leaders in Georgia appeared unable to adequately appreciate the state of relations between the two countries. ""So, a misfortune has happened -- yes, supplies [of gas to Georgia] have been stopped. But our specialists are working night and day in the mountains in minus 30 degrees [Celsius] of frost in order to restore energy supplies to Georgia. And what do we hear and see from the Georgian leadership? They just spit at us,"" Putin said. Bitter Relations That is not of course how the Georgians see things. President Mikheil Saakashvili is no less bitter than his Russian counterpart. He has accused Moscow of deliberately sabotaging the pipeline in the middle of the coldest Georgian winter in decades. ""The aim of the explosions was to demoralize Georgia and show the entire world that we were weak and a feeble country without perspective,"" Saakashvili said. ""Instead, this sabotage produced completely the opposite result: it turned out that we have a very strong society. Our society emerged strengthened from this crisis."" The chasm that divides Georgia and its resentful northern neighbor is becoming wider. And that will perhaps have important consequences for Russia's control of the South Caucasus. As in Ukraine and the Baltic states, Russia's leverage has rested in considerable part on control of the energy supply. Until this month, Georgia was 100 percent dependent on Russian gas. Not any more. At the critical moment, Georgia turned to Iran for help and got it. ""Today [30 January], an event of historical importance has occurred, thanks to the fact that last year we restored the [Iran-Azerbaijan-Georgia] pipeline in readiness for just such an eventuality. For the first time since the restoration of Georgian independence, Georgia is being supplied not just with Russian gas but with an alternative source. Of course, we will sharply strengthen our work in this direction,"" Saakashvili said. Gas From Iran It's the last sentence that is the really significant one. It appears to suggest that the Georgians would like to make the Iranian solution a permanent one. Georgia's Energy Minister Nika Gilauri, back from talks in Iran, said that Russian policy has played a clear role in prompting Georgia to secure the independence and security of its energy supply. ""Although in any case, any country with just one supplier of energy would be forced to look for additional sources and additional supplier countries,"" he said. Tbilisi residents huddle around campfires during the gas crunch in January (epa) The gas from Azerbaijan and Iran delivers about 4 million cubic meters a day -- still just 30 percent of Georgia's needs. But from next year Georgia will have more options when the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline brings gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz line on stream. U.S. Relations Might it not irritate Washington, though, that its ally in the Caucasus is turning to Iran for help? When Saakashvili spoke by telephone to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on 30 January, Georgia's energy problems topped the agenda. Given the U.S. desire to strengthen Georgia's economic independence -- and in particular its energy independence -- it seems prepared to turn a blind eye to Georgia's Iranian deal. The Georgian president's press office reported after the conversation with Rice that the United States was ""ready to provide assistance in ensuring the energy security of Georgia."" But the ramifications of this particular spat don't stop in Georgia. Armenia, the most loyal of Russian allies, has also begun to grumble. The pipeline that supplies its gas from Russia is the same one that supplies Georgia -- so the explosions cut its gas off as well. And Gazprom has also just doubled the price of gas to Armenia (and Georgia) to $110 per 1,000 cubic meters. Little wonder then that the Armenians regard the latest crisis as complete vindication of their decision to begin importing gas from Iran using a pipeline now under construction. Russia is believed to be opposed to the project and, according to the Moscow daily ""Kommersant,"" offered at one point to keep the gas price at $59 in return for a 45 percent stake in the Armenian section of the pipeline. This prompted outrage in Armenia but was immediately denied by Armenian presidential spokesman Viktor Soghomonyan. But the controversy may not stop there. Iran -- and Georgia -- would like to link the new Armenia-Iran pipeline up to the Shah Deniz line that is now nearing completion. This would give Georgia even greater access to Iranian gas and link the Iranian market up to Europe. Some observers have speculated that Russia has forced the Armenian government to reduce the pipeline's planned diameter to prevent Iranian gas being re-exported.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1065304.html,NagornoKarabakh Minsk Group CoChair Hopes For 2006 Progress ,"February 01, 2006 10:31 GMT",,,"Steven Mann (official site) On 10-11 February, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, are due to meet on the outskirts of Paris for talks on the Nagorno-Karabakh peace settlement. Some observers have speculated the two sides may be approaching a breakthrough in the 15-year conflict. Ahead of the Rambouillet talks, Hrair Tamrazian, director of RFE/RL's Armenian Service, and Kenan Aliyev of RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service conducted a joint interview with Steven Mann, the American co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, which is mediating the peace process. RFE/RL: Ambassador, what are you planning at the Paris talks? What can we expect from this meeting of the presidents? Many expect a breakthrough. What's your opinion? Steven Mann: First of all, the co-chairs are going to be going to Baku and Yerevan this week for further meetings with the foreign ministers [Azerbaijan's Elmar Mammadyarov and Armenia's Vartan Oskanian] and with the presidents as part of our preparation for France. And then, next week, at the invitation of President [Jacques] Chirac, the presidents will be coming to France, and there will participate in discussions under the umbrella of the OSCE co-chairs. So that's what we have looking forward. What I would say is this: We have been working in the context of the Prague process [promoting direct contact between the two foreign ministers] for almost two years now, where we have had serious and detailed discussions and negotiations between the two sides. And the presidents themselves have met a number of times for talks on Karabakh. I think all of us recognize that we are at the stage where we have to turn the corner from negotiation to decision. And speaking from the American perspective, we believe that the possibility for a deal exists in the months ahead. So I think the meetings that are coming up in the next two weeks are a very important opportunity. And again, speaking from the American side, we do not want the sides to fail to take advantage of this important opportunity. RFE/RL: What exactly will you be discussing there in Paris, and what exactly will the presidents be discussing under your supervision? Mann: What exactly, of course I can't say, because we don't want to violate the confidentiality of the negotiations. But I expect that the full range of issues related to a Nagorno- Karabakh agreement will be under discussion. RFE/RL: Almost every institution that is directly or indirectly involved with these peace talks says there is an option on the table of the return of the occupied territories and a possible referendum -- an expression of the will of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. What can you tell us about this? Mann: In a word, nothing. Because I don't want to go into any of the substance of the negotiations. But I will say that the process has been moving in the right direction, it has been moving in the right direction for some time, and there are extremely substantial benefits that we could look forward to for each side in this. Any agreement has to have a win-win outcome. There has to be something in it for each side. And I believe that the discussions have been moving in that direction. Now, the issues are very difficult issues. If the subject were less difficult, it would have been solved years ago. Even with the best of will on each side -- and we do have good will, on the part of each foreign minister and each president -- but even with the best of will, these are very, very difficult issues. So I do not minimize the task. But that said, I believe that with dedication, some flexibility, and political will, 2006 can be the year for a Karabakh agreement. RFE/RL: Are any promises being made to the sides that if they come to an agreement, there will be full international support, for example on the issue of reconstruction, rebuilding the occupied territories. Will there will be any financial support? Mann: Oh, I think absolutely. Without going into the details, I think major international support and reconstruction for all sides that have been affected in this must be a part of a deal. RFE/RL: What will be the format of the Paris meeting? Will the two presidents meet with Chirac and then stay with him in his residency? Or will all of you get together there? Mann: I must refer any questions about the substance, the framework, of the visit itself to my French colleague [Bernard Fassier]. RFE/RL: One thing that is known already, Mr. Ambassador, is that Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian has said himself there is a paper on the table -- it's not an agreement or a formal document -- but there is a paper on which both sides outline the basic principles of an agreement, and they might sign that. What can you tell us about this paper? Mann: I don't want to get into any of the issues of the substance of the talks, so I'm going to have to leave that to the side. RFE/RL: What is your message to both sides at this important moment? Mann: I don't think I have a sound bite to give you. But what I've said reflects accurately the way the American government is looking at this.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1065233.html,Russia Does Gazprom Have A Master Pipeline Plan ,"January 30, 2006 14:20 GMT",,,"(AFP) Russia's state-controlled monopoly Gazprom is the world's largest gas company, and the 10th-largest company in the world after its shares rose over 13 percent on the London market in mid-January. But its ambitions don't necessarily end there. Is Gazprom looking to assume control of the gas-transit market in Eastern and Central Europe? After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, Viktor Chernomyrdin -- then head of Gazprom and on the way to being appointed prime minister -- devised a plan to maintain as a single unit, falling under Gazprom's purview, the gas- transportation infrastructure of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. In formulating the plan, Chernomyrdin and his advisers were following the most fundamental principle in gas geopolitics -- the winners need not only access to large gas reserves, but also efficient systems for delivering that gas to market. He who controls the pipelines, therefore, controls the buyer -- and, to some degree, the country where the gas originates. Pipeline Problems It was a good plan -- but it failed. Ukraine and Belarus refused to give up what they considered the lucrative business of gas transit and insisted on nationalizing the pipelines on their territory. The main components of the former Soviet system were divvied up between the three states. But Gazprom, looking at the defeat as a short-term setback, set itself the far-reaching goal of buying up much of the gas- transit systems in the former Soviet Union as well as in Eastern and Central Europe. Its hope was to someday control the entire regional gas distribution system. To date, Gazprom has had only mild success realizing its plan in the FSU. The pre-independence gas pipeline system in Belarus, for example, is still controlled by Beltransgas, the state-owned pipeline company. (This should not be confused with the post-Soviet Yamal-Europe pipeline, built and owned by Gazprom, which carries Russian gas through Belarus to Poland and on to Germany.) In Ukraine, the Soyuz pipeline and the two-thread Urengoy- Uzhgorod pipeline remain under Kyiv's control. Georgia -- still shivering from its abrupt shutoff of Russian gas after apparent pipeline sabotage last week -- likewise resists pressure from Moscow to cede control over its pipeline in exchange for cheaper gas. Gazprom is estimated to have spent $2.6 billion on shareholdings in dozens of gas ventures in Italy, France, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Finland, Turkey, and elsewhere. Elsewhere, Gazprom is gaining ground. Armenia, trying to diversify its energy sources, is currently building a pipeline to Iran. Gazprom, however, has insisted the diameter of the pipe be smaller than originally planned -- in order to prevent Armenian from shipping surplus Iranian gas to Georgia. In Estonia, Gazprom owns a greater share of the national gas company, AS Eesti Gaas (30.64 percent) than the Estonian government (27 percent). Eesti Gaas, in turn, owns the country's gas transportation system. The list of other Gazprom holdings in former Soviet republics includes Moldova's Gazsnabtranzit, where Gazprom owns 50 percent of the authorized capital; and Lithuania's Stella Vitae, of which it owns 30 percent. Gazprom also owns 25 percent of Latvia's Latvias Gaze. And Gazprom, of course, has a significant presence even beyond the former Soviet Union. Poland The gas pipeline system running through Poland was built jointly with Russia, and Gazprom holds a 50-percent share. Gazprom also holds 46 percent of the Polish company EvRoPol Gaz. In 2005, Gazprom arranged for Poland to buy 3.4 billion cubic meters of gas from RosUkrEnergo (RUE), the Swiss-based company now serving as an intermediary in Russia's controversial gas deal with Ukraine. ""Platts Commodity News"" reported that in September 2005, RUE became the main supplier of Russian gas to Poland. Gazprom also holds a 35-percent stake in Poland's Gas Trading consortium, and nearly half of EuRoPol Gaz joint-stock company. Germany In the early spring of 1991, Gazprom attempted to buy a 25- percent stake in Verbundnetz Gas AG, which operated the entire gas distribution system in the former East Germany. But despite help from the German chemical company BASF, Gazprom was not allowed to take part in the tender and the stake was bought by Germany's Ruhrgas. Gazprom's bid was primarily based on a wish to lower its dependency on Ruhrgas. Ruhrgas had been dictating the prices it paid for Russian gas, a practice that angered Chernomyrdin. He felt that Russia, as the seller, was in a position to name the price it wanted to charge. But in the ensuing years, Gazprom was able to gain a considerable presence in the German gas market through its partnership and joint venture agreements with the German gas company Wintershall. Today it has three major joint ventures with Wintershall, Wingas WIEH and WIEE, as well as agreements with Ruhrgas, Verbundnetz Gas and Siemens AG. Hungary Gazprom holds a 50-percent stake in Hungary's Panruysgaz. And in 2001, it set its sights on the country's chemical company BorsodChem. This was not only for its chemicals, but also because it owned a minority stake in TVK, Hungary's second- largest chemical firm, which also controlled a large part of the country's pipelines. A Europol report from September 2001 reported that 24.8 percent of BorsodChem's shares were owned by a principal Hungarian bank that was ""simultaneously acting on behalf"" of Sibur, the Russian petrochemical firm controlled by Gazprom, in acquiring more shares. The report went on to say a further 8 percent of BorodsChem was owned by MDM, a Russian bank. A further 5 percent was owned by unidentified financial investors, two of whom were linked to organized crime groups in St. Petersburg, and another of whom worked in collusion with MDM. Europol also noted that Austrian investment bank Vienna Capital Partners ""colluded with Sibur in coordinating share bids in BorodsChem."" In the end, Gazprom did not succeed in gaining a share in Hungary's pipeline system. But Gazprom has used the same tactics elsewhere, to better effect. Slovakia Gazprom's activities in Slovakia are significant since most gas which transits through Ukraine bound for Europe first enters Slovakia and is then routed further west. In April 1997, a series of agreements were signed between Chernomyrdin and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar that gave Slovakia's national gas company SPP a discount of $5 per thousand cubic meters. (S lovakia used 6 billion cubic meters of gas in 1997.) In return, a Gazprom-Slovak joint venture was created to transport Russian gas to the EU. The exact terms of the joint venture were never published. The 1997 agreements are to expire in 2008. In July 2002 the European Commission approved the purchase of a 49-percent stake in SPP by Gazprom, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France. He who controls the pipelines controls the buyer -- and, to some degree, the country where the gas originates. The deal was worth $2.7 billion and was financed by Ruhrgas and Gaz de France. Gazprom paid a third of this sum in installments. The SPP pipeline system transports about 70 percent of all gas supplied from Russia via Ukraine to Europe. Gazprom also holds a 50-percent stake in Slovakia's Slovrusgaz. And the investments don't end there. Gazprom has shareholdings in Italy's Volta (39 percent), the British-Belgian company Interconnector (10 percent), France's Fragaz (50 percent), and similar companies in Austria, Serbia, Greece, Finland, Bulgaria, and Turkey. In October 2005, the amount Gazprom had spent on those investments was estimated at $2.6 billion.The ""International Herald Tribune"" cited Emmanuel Bergasse, administrator for Central and Eastern Europe and the International Energy Agency, as saying ""Gazprom has substantial market power from being the supplier of gas down to the customer. It is the chain that counts."" He added: ""Gazprom's stated aim is to extend its dominant position, with obvious consequences for European energy diversification.""",,,

It was already reviewed by the foreign ministers of the two countries in London last week.De Gucht said there were still many stumbling blocks to be overcome but a settlement would be beneficial to both countries.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1065154.html,ArmeniaAzerbaijan Will Presidents Meeting Yield Progress Toward Karabakh Peace Deal ,"January 27, 2006 14:29 GMT",,,"Kocharian (left) and Aliyev at an August 2005 meeting in Kazan (AFP) Recent talks between Armenia's and Azerbaijan's foreign ministers failed to shed much light on the likelihood of a major breakthrough in the Karabakh peace process. The discussions, held in London on 18-19 January under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk Group, were being watched closely for any indication that a February meeting between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev might result in a compromise. Uncertainty Of PrinciplesArmenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian did confirm the day after the London talks that the two sides are seeking to reach agreement on a half-page document that enumerates general principles that could then form the basis for a more detailed peace plan. But Oskanian said that while the two sides' positions vis-a-vis some of those principles have drawn closer, on others their positions are still far apart, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Day.az on 26 January similarly quoted Mammadyarov as telling journalists in Baku that the two sides are still trying to reach agreement on the ""general principles."" It therefore remains unclear whether the two countries' presidents will indeed succeed in reaching a compromise on the contested points, let alone publicly endorse those basic principles, during their upcoming summit near Paris, which Kocharian's spokesman has said will take place on 10 February. Azerbaijani presidential administration official Novruz Mammadov hinted in a 20 January interview with the online daily echo-az com that it is unlikely the two presidents will sign any agreements during their ""first meeting of the year.""The basic principles have formed the focus of what has become known as the Prague process talks between Oskanian and Mammadyarov (so-called because the first few meetings took place inPrague in the summer of 2004 and January 2005). On 7 June 2005, Mammadyarov told journalists in Baku that the two sides were discussing between seven and nine issues relatedto a peace settlement, and that those issues had to be addressed in a specific order, with each made secure before the following is added, ""like pearls knotted on a silk thread."" The BlueprintsMammadyarov said Azerbaijan insists on the liberation of the seven Azerbaijani districts bordering on Karabakh that are currently occupied by Armenian forces. He also claimed the two sides were discussing which countries or organizations could provide peacekeeping forces to be deployed on those territories after their liberation, according to day.az. Echo-az.com quoted Mammadyarov as saying that the two sides were discussing both ""phased"" and ""package"" approaches to resolving the conflict. But a senior Armenian Foreign Ministry official told RFE/RL on 8 June on condition of anonymity that the final agreement will be a package one, although its various provisions may be implemented one after the other, rather than simultaneously.Then, in early July 2005, a senior Armenian official told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that under the anticipated peace deal, Armenia would return to Azerbaijani control five of the seven Azerbaijani districts adjacent to Karabakh currently occupied by Karabakh Armenian forces, not including the strategic Lacin corridor. An international peacekeeping force would be deployed in the conflict zone under the aegis of the OSCE. Then, at some unspecified future date the population of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would be required to vote in a referendum on the region's future status. That blueprint is very similar to those proposed in December 2004 by former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio and NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche; and by the International Crisis Group in a document released on 11 October 2005, although the ICG plan envisages the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all seven occupied Azerbaijani districts including Lacin.Haik Kotandjian, an adviser to Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian, outlined an alternative ""road map"" for resolving the conflict in a 22 November interview with regnum.ru. That three-stage plan comprised the same elements, but in reverse order: it envisaged a referendum on the status of the NKR, followed by the deployment of international peacekeepers and the simultaneous withdrawal of Armenian forces from five of the occupied districts (not including Lacin and Kalbacar); the third stage comprised the rehabilitation of the conflict zone.Near SuccessesIn early July 2005, Armenian officials told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Armenia and Azerbaijan had reached agreement on the key points of a formal peace accord ending the Karabakh conflict, and that agreement could be signed by the end of this year. The two ministers, and the two presidents, subsequently met in late August in Kazan on the sidelines of a CIS summit, but failed to announce any major progress toward a settlement. Then, on 4 December, Oskanian told RFE/RL that he and Mammadyarov failed during talks in Ljubljana on the sidelines of the OSCE foreign ministers' annual meeting to agree on a date for the next meeting between the two presidents -- a meeting that Oskanian hinted could prove a pivotal moment in the search or a settlement.But despite that failure to schedule a meeting between the two presidents, preparations were launched for one aspect of a peace settlement: provision was made for a high-level OSCE planning group to visit the Karabakh conflict zone to assess the requirements for deploying an international peacekeeping force in the event of the withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the Azerbaijani territory contiguous to the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic that they currently occupy. Noyan Tapan reported on 22 January the arrival of that delegation in Stepanakert. Azerbaijani soldiers in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1992 (AFP)In a 19 January interview with APA news agency that was posted the following day on day.az, Azerbaijani presidential administration official Mammadov said that Azerbaijan's overriding priorities are for Armenia to agree to a settlement of the conflict that would preserve Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory. Mammadov dismissed as ""unimportant"" the issue of including representatives of the NKR in the peace process, which the ICG plan advocates. He said that peacekeeping forces should be deployed along the entire length of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border and ""between Armenian- and Azerbaijani-populated villages."" He said it was premature to discuss the possibility of a referendum, which would, he estimated, be held only in 15-20 years' time.Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov, President Aliyev's special representative for the Karabakh talks, was more categorical, telling journalists in Baku on 23 January that talk of a referendum is no more than ""rumors,"" day.az reported.Reality CheckNeither Mammadov nor Azimov appears to have made the crucial point, noted on 19 January by the online daily zerkalo.az, that Article 3 of the Azerbaijani Constitution explicitly bars the possibility of changes to the country's borders being submitted to a nationwide referendum. For such a referendum to take place, a preliminary referendum would first have to be held to amend those articles of the constitution, and few Azerbaijani voters are likely to endorse any amendments that would facilitate the loss of Azerbaijani jurisdiction over Karabakh.Even if the two presidents succeed during the coming year in finalizing a set of ""general principles"" intended to serve as the blueprint for a more detailed peace plan, there is still no guarantee that one side or the other will not find it expedient to renege on them at some future date. The so-called ""Paris Principles"" agreed on in the spring of 2001 were elaborated on in further talks in Florida in April 2001 and during subsequent meetings between Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev's father and predecessor, Heydar Aliyev. U.S. diplomat Rudolf Perina, who served as the U.S. Minsk Group co-chairman during those talks, later revealed that in 2002 the two sides came ""incredibly close"" to hammering out a peace agreement. But Armenian officials say Baku reneged on that deal shortly before a planned summit between Kocharian and Heydar Aliyev in June 2002 that was cancelled at the last minute.",,,

Responding to what he said were concerns the WHO had exaggerated the threat of a human pandemic, Jong-Wook said the WHO was not overplaying the threat. WHO experts plan to help countries near Turkey assess the risk of a bird-flu outbreak that they face. Those countries include Syria, Iran, Iraq, Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.

The news, which was broken by Pamuk's lawyer Haluk Inanici but which has yet to be officially confirmed, was quickly welcomed by the European Union. A spokesman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the ruling ""is obviously good news for Mr. Pamuk but it's also good news for freedom of expression in Turkey."" Good news for Pamuk, indeed. The best-selling author had faced up to three years in jail over remarks he made, nearly a year ago, about the World War I-era killings of Armenians and the more recent deaths of thousands of Kurds. In the past century, he'd said, ""a million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in these lands,"" but few dare to talk about it. The comments touched a nerve in Turkey, which has rejected any attempt to label the killings of Armenians in the last years of the Ottoman Empire as ""genocide."" And there were noisy scenes at Pamuk's first appearance in court in December, when his car was pelted with eggs as angry nationalists shouted ""Traitor!"" Today's decision is also good news for Turkey. Pamuk's case had drawn international criticism, particularly from the EU, which Turkey hopes one day to join. But while the EU and others have welcomed today's move, some point to the dozens of others who face similar charges in Turkey. ""We are absolutely delighted but we're also concerned that there still remain a number of other writers and journalists who are on trial at the moment for similar offenses,"" said Sara Whyatt, who works in the London office of International PEN, which campaigns for writers' freedom of expression worldwide. ""Even though the trials might end in suspension [suspended sentences] we have to see the end of laws such as Article 301 [under which Pamuk was changed], such as the articles which can bring journalists to court for criticizing court decisions, we have to see an end to that before we can really say that there is true freedom of expression in Turkey."" Pamuk's case was dropped on a technicality. The court had adjourned his trial in December to ask the justice ministry whether it should proceed. The justice minister, Cemil Cicek, responded last week, saying the decision was not his to make. So the court said the case could not go ahead. Freedom of speech campaigners say they hope other cases, too, will have a similarly positive ending.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1064919.html,CIS ArmenianAzerbaijani Cup Match Falls Through Raises Eyebrows ,"January 20, 2006 18:08 GMT",,,"(official site) Armenia and Azerbaijan were set to square off today for a semifinal soccer match in the Commonwealth Cup being played in Moscow. But the Armenians refused to play, claiming Russia had failed to give them proper security guarantees. The Russian Football Union, however, says the team's withdrawal may have more to do with politics than with security. Moscow, 20 January 2006 (RFE/RL) -- Soccer fans in former Soviet countries will remember the 2006 edition of the Commonwealth Cup as the first time a team withdrew from the Moscow tournament since its creation in 1993. The cup brings together the league champions from all 15 former Soviet republics. And while it may have lost much of the prestige it enjoyed in the 1990s, it nonetheless remains a respected soccer competition in the region. Karen Harutyunian, the deputy president of this year's Armenian champion, Pyunik Yerevan, told a press conference yesterday that the team decided to withdraw because it feared for the safety of its players. Scuffles erupted last year at the Commonwealth Cup quarterfinal match between Pyunik and the Azerbaijani team, Neftchi Baku. The Azerbaijani champions won the 2005 cup match by a score of 2:0 -- and were to meet on the pitch again this year. Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan have been frosty, at best, since the early 1990s, when they fought a bloody three-year war over Nagorno-Karabakh -- the predominantly ethnic Armenian exclave within Azerbaijan that seceded from the then-Soviet republic in 1988. Despite signing a cease-fire, both countries are still formally at war. Harutyunian said Russia had failed to guarantee the safety of the Armenian team in the face of what he described as numerous threats from Azerbaijanis. Scuffles erupted last year at the Commonwealth Cup quarterfinal match between Pyunik and the Azerbaijani team, Neftchi Baku. The Azerbaijani champions won the 2005 cup match by a score of 2:0 -- and were to meet on the pitch again this year. ""Still at the Pyunik-Shakhtyor match, many Azerbaijani fans had shouted insults and threatened to kill and take vengeance,"" Harutyunian said. ""All Russian-language Azerbaijani Internet sites were also full of similar threats. We have information that many Moscow-based Armenians and Azerbaijanis prepare to repeat last year's events. After not receiving written guarantees on security issues -- fully understanding the value of the game as a sports event and foreseeing all possible reactions -- we decided not to play. We made this decision in order not to politicize the game, to avoid possible provocations, to prevent danger to Armenian players, Armenian fans, and Armenian nationals in Moscow."" The date on which the match was set to take place likely fuelled Pyunik's fears -- as it falls on a particularly sensitive date in Armenian- Azerbaijani relations. On 20 January 1990, the Soviet leadership sent troops into the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, to repress civilian unrest. The crackdown, in which more than 100 civilians were killed, is commemorated every year by Azerbaijanis as ""Black January."" The Armenian team's pull-out from the tournament stirred up a storm of accusations from both Russian and Azerbaijani observers. The Azerbaijani press today lashed out at the Armenian players, branding them ""cowards"" and calling their withdrawal a ""scandal."" The Russian Football Union also harshly condemned the move and warned that Pyunik could well be barred from participating in next year's Commonwealth Cup. ""Such actions do not befit football, which should bring athletes, fans, countries and people together, not pull them apart,"" Vitaly Mutko, Russia's soccer chief, said in statement released yesterday. ""With their action, they have disappointed thousands of fans."" ""Objectively, in terms of sport, Neftchi was stronger in this tournament, and obviously the Armenians were to proud to lose to Azerbaijanis."" -- Russian Football Union spokesman Many blame the Armenians for mixing politics with sports by refusing to play with Azerbaijanis. For Igor Vladimirov, a spokesman for the Russian Football Union, Pyunik's withdrawal carries clear political undertones. ""Allegedly they were not provided adequate security, and I know they complained about accommodation and food,"" Vladimirov said. ""In our opinion, these were simply excuses not to play with the Azerbaijani team. Objectively, in terms of sport, Neftchi was stronger in this tournament, and obviously the Armenians were to proud to lose to Azerbaijanis."" The Armenian Football Union, however, appears to have denied responsibility for the incident. Vladimirov said the Armenian Football Union told Mutko that Pyunik acted without consulting the union. The incident unfolded against the background of talks between the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in London. Yesterday, Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian announced that the two countries' leaders would meet next month in France to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.",,,

That will be Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's fifth summit with his Armenian counterpart since his election in October 2003. PRAGUE, 20 January 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The announcement was made late on 19 January by Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian in an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service. ""I can now confirm that there will be a new meeting between the two presidents and [that] the French side has already handed the invitations to both presidents,"" Oskanian said. ""The venue and the exact day of the meeting will be finalized by the French side and they should announce [it] soon, [in] the coming days."" France co-chairs the Minsk Group of nations mandated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to mediate in the talks. Russia and the United States are the other co-chairs. All three countries have been acting as mediators since 1997, nearly three years after Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to suspend military hostilities. Predominantly ethnic Armenian Karabakh seceded from then Soviet Azerbaijan in 1988, triggering a war that claimed some 30,000 lives and drove over 800,000 people -- mostly Azeris and Kurds -- from their homes. In addition to Karabakh, Armenian troops are controlling seven Azerbaijani administrative districts next to the breakaway enclave. The upcoming summit will be the fifth between Armenian President Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev. The two leaders met twice in 2004 and twice in 2005. Commenting on the peace process last month, the Minsk Group co-chairs expressed confidence that the year 2006 would bring the two antagonists closer to a settlement. Addressing reporters in Yerevan on 15 December 2005 after talks with Kocharian, France's Minsk Group envoy Bernard Fassier said he was hopeful the coming months could be a milestone: ""We are convinced that next year, [there will be] a real window of opportunity to achieve some significant progress [toward] a peaceful settlement of the [dispute] elaborated on the basis of what has been already worked out this year."" While voicing optimism, U.S. representative Steven Mann that same day cautioned against too high expectations, saying there was still a long road before achieving anything short of a peace agreement. ""After our meeting with President Kocharian we believe as firmly as ever that events are moving in the right direction. These are very tough negotiations and neither side has ever taken any position that I would characterize as soft,"" Mann said. ""But what you have to understand and what gives us hope as negotiators is that even though the sides are very tough-minded in putting their positions forward, we are seeing a desire on the part of each side to look towards an agreement. But that doesn't mean it will be easy."" Oskanian on 19 January expressed similar caution, saying the talks he had in London with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov had ""reached their purpose,"" which was to pave the way for a presidential summit. Not A Draft Agreement The Armenian foreign minister said both sides were still working on what he described as a ""non paper"" that intends to serve as a framework document for future talks: ""It is not a draft agreement, let's make that very clear. This is a half-page text where certain principles of the [conflict's] resolution have been articulated and this serves as a guideline for talks between the [foreign] ministers, and also the presidents [of both countries]. Once those principles [will] be agreed [upon], then [they] could serve as a basis for a more detailed document, which eventually could serve as a guiding document for the resolution of the conflict."" Oskanian further hinted that the sides were still far from a consensus on the basic principles of a peaceful settlement, saying he hoped the two presidents would achieve progress on what he and Mammadyarov could not agree upon. Azerbaijan has not yet commented on the outcome of the London meeting. Mammadyarov last month said the sides were working on nine basic principles, including one that envisions the deployment of international peacekeepers in parallel with the gradual liberation of Azerbaijan's occupied territories. In comments posted today on the Day.Az news website, President Aliyev's aide Novruz Mammadov said the deployment of peacekeepers could be decided only in the final stage of the negotiation process. As for the possibility of Karabakh residents holding a referendum on the political status of the enclave -- an idea that resurfaced recently -- Mammadov made it clear it could not happen before Armenian troops withdraw from the Azerbaijani territories that are currently under their control. Also on Thursday, Azerbaijan's Defense Minister Safar Abiyev insisted that the international community force Armenia to liberate ""all occupied territories,"" adding that failure to do so ""could lead to a resumption of military activities."" Azerbaijani officials have made similar comments in the past, threatening to forcibly retake occupied territories. Political experts both inside and outside the region believe those bellicose statements were meant primarily for domestic consumption.",,,

The minister discussed progress made during the latest meetings and expectations for the upcoming summit between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev. RFE/RL: Expectations are high. Everybody is saying this was a very crucial meeting and that the ministers will decide, perhaps today, whether the two president will meet in the coming days. What can you tell us about today's meeting? Vardan Oskanian: First, let me say that the meaning of this particular meeting should not be overly exaggerated. It was an important meeting, but let's not overly exaggerate because the purpose of the meeting was to prepare the presidents' next meeting, which most probably will take place during the first half of February. So, in that sense, the meeting served its purpose because we basically made our positions clear to each other. Now we'll go back to our capitals and communicate all these to our presidents and the presidents will attend that meeting better prepared, knowing what to expect, knowing what is the position of the other side. So, in that sense, I would say that it was a positive meeting -- in terms of clarifying each other's position. And I also can now confirm that there will be a meeting between the two presidents, because that was also decided during this meeting. And the French side already handed the invitations to both presidents to attend the next meeting, in France. The venue and the exact date of the meetings will be finalized by the French side and they should announce soon, in the coming days. RFE/RL: Will there be another meeting, after this one, between you and [Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Mammadyarov], before the presidents' meeting? Oskanian: No, I don't think there will be another meeting between the two ministers. There is not much time and there is not much to talk [about] anymore. And so, we will wait for the presidents to meet and we will take it from there. RFE/RL: Can we expect a breakthrough? Oskanian: It is difficult to make that kind of a judgment, but one should hope that the presidents will be able to register progress. RFE/RL: There was a report that there is a working paper right now that you and the Azeri foreign minister are discussing. What can you tell us about that? Oskanian: There is a nonpaper. We've talked about this before. It is not a draft agreement -- let's make that very clear. It is a half-page text which is a nonpaper, where certain principles of the resolution of the conflict have been articulated and this serves as a guideline for talks between the ministers and also the presidents. Once the principles have been agreed to, then these principles could serve as the basis for a more detailed document, which eventually could serve as a guiding document for the resolution of the conflict. RFE/RL: Did you make today progress on that paper? Oskanian: Well, there are many principles there. On some of them we do have a closer position. On some, our positions are still far apart. But we continue to work and there is always hope that whatever the ministers couldn't achieve, during the presidents' meeting, we'll have progress.",,,

On 16 January, RFE/RL Armenian Service Director Hrair Tamrazian spoke with Dr. Juan Lubroth, a senior officer at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Lubroth just returned from an inspection tour of Turkey. RFE/RL: You just returned from Turkey. As an expert, you have your take on the Turkish situation. How serious is the situation? Is H5N1 spreading rapidly? Juan Lubroth: We only have confirmation on one outbreak in Turkey that we know is H5N1 and that is right across from the Armenian border. The remaining outbreaks that we have confirmation on we know for them to be H5, but we do not know if they are all H5N1. RFE/RL: So the worst virus, H5N1, is from the village near the Armenian border, correct? Lubroth: That's correct. RFE/RL: That's the only H5N1... Lubroth: ...that is confirmed. Most likely, the other viruses that we will identify and characterize from the other poultry outbreaks will also be H5N1, but we don't know that just yet. We do know that what has been confirmed from the human cases is H5N1. RFE/RL: Is there any chance that there could be human-to-human transfer of the virus, or not at this stage? Lubroth: Perhaps that question would be best answered by someone from the WHO [World Health Organization] or the ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]. However, we have no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this stage. Yes, I agree with my director that we would need good and transparent information from the neighboring countries from Turkey, where we would be guaranteed that the disease is not there. However, we have heard for the past several months reports of high poultry deaths in some of those neighboring countries bordering Turkey. In some cases, it has been determined to be poisoning. In other cases, it has been determined to be other infectious diseases. And that would need to be qualified and verified by some of the OIE [World Organization for Animal Health] and FAO reference laboratories. RFE/RL: What you are saying now is that you know there were some cases of dead poultry. Is the Armenian government contacting you about these matters? Are they trying to work through your organization? Do you have any complaint against them? Lubroth: We have been dealing with the veterinary services of Armenia in the past and we have some current projects. Although we have projects in Armenia and a good relationship with their veterinary services, we have not gotten specific reports regarding poultry and poultry health from them. RFE/RL: You know, there are some reports that poultry is dying in some villages and they are testing in local laboratories in the capital city. And they say there is no bird flu. Is that the right way to proceed? Lubroth: For us to tell that it is not bird flu, it would be very important for us to know why these birds are dying and to prove to the international community that Armenia does not have H5 or H5N1. It is one thing to say it; it is another thing to prove it. We would welcome working more closely with the Armenian authorities to assist them to provide reliable diagnosis and even to offer the availability of OIE and FAO reference laboratories, who have great experience in identifying the virus and characterizing the virus. RFE/RL: Can we say that you are not happy with the government's actions? Lubroth: No, it is not that we are not happy. We do do a lot of work with them on other animal-health issues. We just would like to be able to have, perhaps, better communication and sample sharing to the reference laboratories on a regular basis. And there is a reporting obligation to the World Organization for Animal Health and those reports should be substantiated with quality diagnostics. We do not know the level, the capacity, of the Armenian laboratory or other laboratories in the region to do that type of diagnosis. RFE/RL: There are some radio reports that in some villages just across the border in Armenia.... We sent our correspondent and the guy came back and said, you know, villagers are complaining that poultry is dying. And they take them to the local laboratories and they say, no, it is some kind of plague or whatever. Is that the right way to proceed? Lubroth: No, it is not the right way. We would need to know, if it is not avian influenza, what is it? And we do not know what it is. Do you see? There are many diseases that look like avian influenza. One is caused by salmonella and it is called fowl cholera. Now, it could be fowl cholera and I would not doubt it if you show me the bacteria. Now, it could be Newcastle Disease, another avian disease, and I wouldn't doubt it. Just show me the virus. And I don't have that. I'm not getting that type of information. So rather than to criticize the countries that we are trying to assist, it would be better for us to be able to assist them and for us to have good communications with those countries. We are preparing a WHO and FAO -- together with the OIE -- mission to Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, probably Syria in the next few days to be able to see what level of preparedness do these countries have on the human level, at the veterinary level, and to perhaps see are these laboratories able to characterize the virus or the bacteria. RFE/RL: So you are sending your experts? Lubroth: We have to get country permission in order to do that, and that is what we are working on with the WHO. RFE/RL: Is there any problem there? Getting permission... Lubroth: No, we've just started organizing this yesterday and we are not at that stage yet.",,,
,D,https://www.rferl.org/a/1064754.html,ArmeniaAzerbaijan Foreign Ministers Seek To Finalize Basic Principles For Resolving Karabakh Conflict ,"January 16, 2006 16:22 GMT",,Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan optimistic about peace agreements,"Kocharian and Aliyev during their August meeting in Kazan (file photo) (AFP) Prague, 16 January 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan are scheduled to meet in London tomorrow with the co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group to prepare the groundwork for a meeting early next month of the two countries' presidents. The group co-chairmen said during a visit to the South Caucasus last month that some progress was achieved during the course of 2005 toward resolving the Karabakh conflict, and they expressed cautious optimism that 2006 could prove to be a window of opportunity in which the two sides reach agreement at least on the basic parameters for a settlement. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian echoed that cautious optimism, telling journalists in Yerevan on 15 December that ""there has been positive movement this year. If that trend continues, it will be possible to expect some document to be born at the beginning of 2006."" Oskanian gave no hint of what that ""document"" might be, but Russian Minsk Group co-chairman Yury Merzlyakov told Azerbaijan's Trend news agency on 21 December that the co-chairs are currently drafting a two-page document that would enumerate the ""basic principles"" for resolving the conflict, and to which the two sides must give their agreement. On 29 December, day.az quoted Merzlyakov as having told APA news agency that during their meetings in Warsaw in May 2005 and Kazan in August, Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev discussed the basic principles for resolving the conflict. Merzlyakov said he hopes that at their upcoming summit the two presidents will give the green light for finalizing a document enumerating those principles, which it would be appropriate to describe as a ""framework document"" rather than a full-fledged peace agreement. That document would then enable the foreign ministers to focus more closely and in greater detail on individual issues that must be addressed. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov for his part told journalists in Baku on 22 December that there are nine ""basic principles"" for a settlement, one of which is the deployment of an international peacekeeping force parallel with the gradual withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory. Merzlyakov said that force would number some 10,000 men, and that in the interests of impartiality it should not include contingents from Russia, the U.S., France, or Turkey. Merzlyakov gave no hint of whether and how the proposed framework document might reconcile the conflicting approaches of the two sides to resolving the conflict. Azerbaijani officials continue to insist on the so-called ""phased"" approach, under which no decision would be made on the final status of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic until Armenian troops have been withdrawn from territory they currently occupy contiguous to the enclave and the Azerbaijani community that fled in 1988 has returned. Azerbaijan also continues to reject any status other than ""the highest degree of autonomy"" within Azerbaijan for Karabakh.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1064675.html,QA How Humans Can Avoid Catching Bird Flu ,"January 13, 2006 12:52 GMT",,,"Ukrainian scientist conducting tests for bird flu, 13 January (ITAR-TASS) How do people contract bird flu? And what precautions can people take, particularly those who live in agricultural areas? RFE/RL asked Dr. Andrew T. Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah and chairman of the national public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. RFE/RL: How do people get bird flu? Pavia: Virtually all cases of transmission so far have come from very close contact with birds, usually ill poultry. Examples of cases where people have gotten sick have been people who've been preparing birds that were being culled for the kitchen. There are some really unusual cases, such as where a person leading a cock fight sucked blood and mucus out of the beak of one of his ill birds. But, having said that, we don't know exactly what kinds of contacts with birds are safe and what aren't. The birds that are involved in human transmission are almost exclusively domestic chickens and ducks so far. RFE/RL: What about wild ducks or other birds? They are not a problem so far? Pavia: To my knowledge, there have not been human cases associated with contact with wild ducks. It would certainly be possible for a hunter to come into contact with an infected duck and theoretically become infected. But I think it's just the sheer volume of domestic poultry that leads to the higher risk. RFE/RL: Obviously, as you said, sucking on a sick bird's beak is not good policy. Is just handling sick poultry in any way a bad idea? Pavia: If there are birds that are sick or if they are being culled for the purposes of reducing the risk, that's when people really need to take precautions. The workers who do the culling are typically wearing gloves, masks, washing their hands before and after contact. And that seems to be providing adequate protection. They are usually wearing gowns or overalls as well. RFE/RL: What if you live near a farm with ill poultry, how do you protect yourself? Pavia: Obviously, we don't know all of the answers yet, but it doesn't appear that casual contact such as having a farm across the street or being close to a farm is enough contact. It appears, so far, that this virus is hard to catch. You have to directly get virus put into your mouth, nose, or eyes. And casual contact with birds or with ill people does not appear to lead to illness. RFE/RL: Can a person get sick from eating the meat from an infected bird? Pavia: That's been a focus of a lot of concern. As far as I am aware, there is no evidence that eating a fully cooked bird has led to illness, but I think that is something people are still looking at fairly carefully. RFE/RL: What about eating uncooked eggs from an infecting chicken? Pavia: Not cooking an egg could result in salmonella, campylobacter -- a whole variety of unpleasant things are more likely than bird flu. RFE/RL: How is the soil around an infected poultry farm affected? Pavia: The good news is that, unlike a bacteria like salmonella, which persists in the environment for a long time when it is in bird manure, influenza is fairly fragile. So, it is not thought that it is going to contaminate the ground for days or weeks after the birds pass by. RFE/RL: So rivers or watersheds near an infected farm are safe? Pavia: There is the theoretical transmission that over the short term a virus could be flushed into a water system or down river, but it's not going to persist a long time. So we don't face the problem that the soil or the rivers are going be contaminated long-term after the infections have cleared up in the birds. The birds are the reservoir. As long as they are infected, then that's where fresh infections are coming from. And because a virus has to be fairly fresh to survive, you need to have a living host like an infected bird. Theoretically, in the future that could be an infected person. And, that's what we worry about.",,,

He told a meeting of the OSCE's permanent council on 12 January that he would visit Armenia and Azerbaijan on 24 January in order to underline his interest in resolving the long dispute over the future of Nagorno-Karabakh. He also plans to visit Kosovo next month to demonstrate his support for current negotiations on the future status of the Serbian province, which has been administered by the United Nations since 1999.

He was most optimistic about Nagorno-Karabakh and South Ossetia. De Gucht indicated that Russia's cooperation is crucial to resolve the conflicts and said Belgium's strategy will be based on avoiding confrontation with Moscow. Brussels, 11 January 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The incoming OSCE presidency-in-office, Belgium, made clear today that it will value compromise over confrontation among the 55 members of the organization. Belgian Foreign Minister Karel de Gucht said this applies in particular to the so-called frozen conflicts in Moldova and the Caucasus. De Gucht noted that in the context of each of these conflicts, Russia plays a very important role. Sometimes, he said, Russia is ""rather reluctant"" about the OSCE, adding that it is the presidency's task to find solutions without provoking confrontation. No Tough Stance On Russia However, de Gucht specifically ruled out a tougher stance vis-a-vis Russia. ""I don't think it is the role of the presidency of the OSCE to judge upon the positions of the parties concerned,"" he said. ""First of all it is the role of the presidency to try and find solutions for the frozen conflicts and especially for Transdniester and Moldova."" Addressing Transdniester, De Gucht said that it is not ""obvious"" how progress can be made. He said Belgium does not want to provoke a ""political debate"" on the issue, but sees its role in being a mediator. De Gucht did criticize what he described as Chisinau's hardening position. ""One of the complicating factors is the recent stance of Moldova on this, which is in fact asking for a unitary state,"" de Gucht said. ""So to a certain extent they have been backtracking on this. And that's what I mean, that maybe we should try to find a solution to the military problems which is not necessarily linked to an immediate solution to the political problem itself."" De Gucht said Belgium will try to avoid what he called ""theoretical debates"" on Russia's so-called Istanbul commitments. This is a reference to an undertaking assumed by Moscow at the OSCE's 1999 Istanbul summit to remove its troops and munitions from Transdniester and Georgia by 2002. Russia has failed to meet that and subsequent deadlines. The Belgian minister said today he is instead looking for ""practical solutions,"" allowing for at least a ""partial"" removal of Russian forces from the breakaway region. De Gucht noted that there are what he described as ""several kinds of troops"" in Transdniester. Some Russian troops remain to guard military stockpiles. Another Russian contingent complements a Ukrainian deployment watching over the unofficial truce between Chisinau and Tiraspol. De Gucht said Russian troops would need to leave in several stages. This could be followed by a political settlement. He said that the ratification of the adapted Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty -- which Russia is pushing for -- is ""intimately"" linked to the resolution of the conflict. De Gucht said he has had extensive contacts with his Russian colleagues, as well as with the Romanian and Ukrainian authorities. He said he will visit the region at the first opportunity. South Ossetia In the Caucasus, things, perhaps, look more hopeful. De Gucht said today that for the first time in years, there are signs of ""an opening"" between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the dispute surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. ""I think we have a window of opportunity now, because there have been elections in Azerbaijan, there has also been a referendum in Armenia on a new constitution,"" he said. ""Windows of opportunity are important in politics and we have signs from several capitals that there might be a chance that we get to a solution."" De Gucht said he will visit the region on 24-26 January to prepare ground for a meeting of the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents in February. He said there is hope that an ""in principle"" agreement could be reached at the meeting, which could then be put into practice later in 2006. De Gucht said that once consensus is reached, the OSCE is prepared to send a force of observers, or even peacekeepers to the region. ""To deploy such a mission, either by the way of observers or by the way of a force that will be positioned in between the parties, that is of course a consensus that will have to be reached within the OSCE, but I think that if the heads of state should come to an agreement, the OSCE would also live up to its obligations,"" de Gucht said. De Gucht said participants for such missions would not be hard to find, as the OSCE has been preparing its involvement for a ""very long time."" De Gucht said he also sees ""some positive signs"" in South Ossetia, which won de facto independence from Georgia in the early 1990s: ""Yes, I think that there are serious prospects of coming to a solution for the problem and in that case we would also be willing to organize a donor conference for South Ossetia in the course of our presidency."" The Belgian foreign minister said he recently met both the Russian and Georgian foreign ministers and believes ""there is an opening there."" However, he said he could not divulge any details. Last month, Georgia urged the EU to raise the issue in its contacts with Russia.",,,

(epa) As the number of human cases of bird flu rise in Turkey, neighboring countries are tightening border controls, looking carefully for signs of the disease, and preparing to fight bird flu. But despite those efforts, the EU has banned poultry imports from them. Prague, 10 January 2006 (RFE/RL) -- In the Turkish town of Dogubeyazit, a scattering of chickens peck and cluck their way around a farmyard, oblivious to the terror gathering around them. A week after the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu took the lives of three children from the same family in Dogubeyazit, chickens continue to run freely in the backyards of a town in which an estimated 90 percent of households keep poultry. Van Province in eastern Turkey is one of the poorest parts of the country and, for many people here, these birds are all they have to stave off hunger. Panic is spreading, with people at a loss to know what to do. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan has tried to assure both Turks and the international community that his government had the situation under control. ""All the necessary measures that needed to be taken are being taken by the health and agriculture ministries,"" he declared on 11 January. ""We have organized a crisis center. You must not pay attention to exaggerated statements."" But no amount of reassuring words can disguise the fact that there are now 14 confirmed cases in Turkey of humans infected by the virus and that many more cases are under investigation. It has also spread beyond Van, as far as the Black Sea coast and the capital, Ankara. Poultry deaths linked to bird flu have also been registered in Istanbul. The Alarm Sounds Little wonder then that Turkey's neighbors are increasingly alarmed. On 10 January, Iran announced that it was closing a border crossing with Turkey, and Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia have all banned the import of Turkish poultry. Armenians feel particularly vulnerable, as Dogubeyazit lies just a few kilometers from the border. Grigor Baghian, head of Armenia's State Veterinary Inspectorate, says mandatory sanitary controls have been imposed at all border crossings. ""We have instructed the relevant authorities to check the baggage of individuals coming from Turkey and to make sure that not a single chicken feather or egg is brought to Armenia,"" he says. Farmers in the impoverished settlements that dot the border fear that they could be next. When dozens of chickens died in the village of Vosketap last week, there was panic. But it subsided when the vets arrived. Nvard Abrahamian, 12 of whose chickens died, says ""our vet inspected the dead chickens and concluded they were killed by another disease. He then inoculated the remaining chickens and said we have nothing to worry about if they stay alive."" At the State Veterinary Inspectorate, though, Grigor Baghian is making no promises that Armenia is safe. ""No cases of bird flu have been registered in Armenia to date. The virus has not reached the republic, but the situation in neighboring countries has put us in a high-risk zone,"" he cautions. ""That means outbreaks of the disease cannot be ruled out tomorrow, the day after, or after that."" In Georgia, which also has a long border with Turkey, the agriculture minister, Mikheil Svimonishvili, was at pains to assure people that, so far, there have been no outbreaks of bird flu in the country. It was message repeated in Azerbaijan by the head of the state veterinary department, Ismail Hasanov. But he spoke of tough controls, particularly in the Nakhichevan region, which borders Turkey. ""The veterinary service is working intensively on the borders. We are following disinfection procedures, we have prepared large stocks of disinfectants, protective clothing, special equipment and we have enough equipment to carry out disinfection measures,"" he said. Europe Bans Poultry Imports None of which was enough to stop the European Commission announcing on 11 January that it was banning the import of poultry and feathers from all six states bordering eastern Turkey: Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria, Iran, and Iraq. Russia, too, said it was tightening control of its borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan, while its chief medical officer, Gennadii Onishchenko, said it might be necessary to impose a temporary travel ban to Turkey if the situation there continued to deteriorate. In the meantime, he urged Russians not to visit Turkey. ""Why does this worry us? First of all, because of its immediate proximity to our borders, and secondly, because in January there will be an increase in ordinary human flu and, viewed against this background, there is a danger that we will not detect the spread onto our territory of this particular [H5N1] type of flu."" Russia has no immediate borders with Turkey. As the H5N1 strain of bird flu continues its seemingly inexorable global advance, doctors are calling for calm. There is still no evidence, they say, that avian flu is spreading between people. All confirmed cases in Turkey were caused by direct contact with birds.

Meanwhile, Ankara Governor Kemal Onal said today that three people hospitalized in the Turkish capital have tested positive for bird flu. The three include two children from the town of Beypazari, 100 kilometers northwest of Ankara, and an adult. No further details were immediately available. It was unclear if it was the H5N1 strain that recently killed at least two children in the southeastern city of Van. Fighting The Outbreak Some reports say culling crews in eastern Turkey have been meeting resistance from farmers unwilling to give up their poultry for slaughter, while other reports suggest locals are frustrated at the slow pace of the culling. Tests have confirmed that two children died from the lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu in the city of Van, near the borders of Iran and Armenia. Those cases were the first human fatalities from H5N1 outside Southeast Asia. Two other children confirmed to have the illness have been hospitalized in Van, while dozens of other people with flu-like symptoms have been taken to nearby medical facilities. Doctors suggested the victims probably contracted the illness by playing with dead chickens. In Iran, the Health Ministry said there is ""tight observation"" in the border area with Turkey. Fears Of Eid Traffic In Istanbul, doctors are warning citizens that bird flu could spread to urban areas when thousands of sheep and goats are brought in to be sacrificed for the coming Muslim Eid holiday. Dr. Gencay Gursoy, chairman of the Istanbul Physicians Association, said he expects the bird flu virus could be transported into cities within the hair of such livestock. ""It is inevitable,"" Gursoy said. ""In eastern and southeastern regions, contact of livestock and poultry is part of the life as even people are living with poultry in their houses. The waste [of poultry that has been infected with the virus] may transfer with the skins and the furs of animals."" Russian Warning Russia's chief epidemiologist on 8 January urged Russian citizens not to travel to Turkey because of the outbreak of bird flu there. Gennadii Onishchenko said it is particularly important for Russians to avoid parts of eastern Turkey near the borders with Iran and Armenia. Onishchenko also signed orders the previous day calling on Russian border authorities to step up health checks on people entering Russia from affected areas. In Saudi Arabia, health experts have warned that the huge crowds pilgrims gathered in Mecca for the annual hajj pilgrimage could create the conditions in which a pandemic strain of bird flu may emerge.

On the contrary, some of the protagonists are making substantial increases to their military budgets for 2006. Prague, 12 December 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh saw little movement in 2005. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group has sought since 1992 to mediate a settlement to that conflict. The group met on four occasions (in January, April, June, and December) with the two countries' foreign ministers, Vartan Oskanian (Armenia) and Elmar Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan). Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, met in Warsaw in May and Kazan in August to discuss points on which the foreign ministers had reportedly reached provisional agreement. Nagorno-Karabakh, an exclave within Azerbaijan, is predominantly ethnic Armenian. The local Armenian population asked the Soviet leadership in February 1988 to transfer the region to Armenia, triggering an exodus of the Azerbaijani population. Following the unilateral 1991 declaration of Nagorno-Karabakh's independence from Azerbaijan, hitherto sporadic fighting escalated into a full-fledged war in which Armenian forces took control of swathes of neighboring Azerbaijani territory. The three sides -- Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic -- signed a cease-fire agreement in May 1994. The exact details of this year's talks have been unclear, despite leaks and subsequent denials. The most contentious issues are the final status of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, the timeframe for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the regions of Azerbaijan bordering the republic, and, in the event of a troop withdrawal, what countries or organizations could provide peacekeepers to be deployed on those territories. The Minsk Group has repeatedly warned that any peace agreement will inevitably require major concessions from both countries. However, with parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan in November, the Baku authorities were understandably reluctant to agree to any concessions. Neither side is slowing down on defense spending, either. Azerbaijani President Aliyev has stressed repeatedly that Baku reserves the right to resort to military force if it proves impossible to reach a negotiated end to the conflict. On Army Day, 25 June, he told military cadets that Azerbaijan's defense spending had increased from $175 million in 2004 to $300 million in 2005. And meeting in early September with residents of Lenkoran in southeastern Azerbaijan, he announced that defense spending would double in 2006, to $600 million. Yerevan was apparently neither intimidated nor impressed by such threats. Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian commented in October that the Azerbaijani leadership gives the impression of being ""drunk on petrodollars."" But Armenia has nonetheless factored an increase in defense spending into its budget for 2006. With the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan over, and no national election due next year in either Armenia or Azerbaijan, mediators are more optimistic at the prospects for a Karabakh peace settlement in 2006. South Ossetia The impasse in Georgia's breakaway republic of South Ossetia has also continued. The region is widely regarded as a hotbed of smuggling and other criminal activities. Currently, Russia, Georgia, and North and South Ossetia jointly police the conflict zone under the aegis of the OSCE. On 29 September, the region erupted into violence when unidentified perpetrators subjected the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, to mortar fire from a neighboring Georgian-populated village, injuring 10 people. Georgia in 2005 unveiled three successive revisions (in January, August, and October) of the peace plan for South Ossetia that Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili first presented to the UN General Assembly in September 2004. But the leadership of the unrecognized Republic of South Ossetia rejected all three overtures. Tbilisi is now seeking to secure a greater role for the international community, which has expressed support for Saakashvili's peace proposals, in monitoring the situation in the South Ossetia. Tbilisi has accused the Russian peacekeepers deployed there of turning a blind eye to abductions and arms and drug smuggling. Moscow and the South Ossetian leadership, however, have rejected Georgia's proposal to include the United States and European Union into the existing peacekeeping arrangement. While Saakashvili has concentrated his diplomatic offensive primarily on forcing a solution to the South Ossetian conflict, it has been left largely to the United Nations to continue the search for a solution to the Abkhaz conflict. The Abkhaz minority on Georgia's Black Sea coast complained for decades of discrimination at the hands of the Georgians, who sent troops into the region in August 1992, triggering a war in which Russia backed the Abkhaz. After 13 months of fighting, the Georgian military retreated, and most non-Abkhaz, including some 250,000 Georgians, fled Abkhazia. In August, the UN mediated talks in Sukhum between Georgian and Abkhaz government officials on security issues for the non-resumption of activities and confidence-building measures in the conflict zone. Sergei Bagapsh, who was elected Abkhaz president in a repeat election in January, has sent mixed signals. He has repeatedly stressed that Abkhazia's self-proclaimed but unrecognized independence is not negotiable. And he has said he regards Russia as Abkhazia's key ally and partner. At the same time, Bagapsh has signaled a more pragmatic and conciliatory approach to economic cooperation with Georgia. He has also seemed willing to put in place security measures that would expedite and facilitate the return to Abkhazia's southernmost Gali Raion of the Georgians who fled the district during the war. In recent weeks, however, Bagapsh has toughened his position, insisting that Georgians who return to live permanently in Gali must adopt Abkhaz citizenship. Most observers attribute the periodic hardening in the positions of the South Ossetian and Abkhaz leadership to pressure from Moscow, on which Bagapsh in particular depends for support in the face of increasing pressure from the Abkhaz opposition. Moscow will almost certainly continue to use Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2006 to exert pressure on Georgia in retaliation for Georgia's high-profile campaign to secure a formal invitation, possibly as early as 2006, to join NATO. And, despite having assured NATO that it would slim down its armed forces, Georgia is reportedly engaged in a massive military buildup. Unconfirmed reports suggest Defense Minister Irakli Okruashvili has ordered the acquisition of primarily offensive weapons such as battle tanks, along with tens of thousands of machine guns to arm reservists. Prigorodnyi Raion Another conflict in the region grabs fewer headlines but is similarly caught in a state of deadlock. There are few prospects for resolving the simmering dispute between Ingushetia and the Republic of North Ossetia over Prigorodnyi Raion. The raion was transferred from Ingushetia to North Ossetia in the wake of the 1944 deportation to Central Asia of the entire Ingush people. Thousands of Ingush who returned to their former homes in the late 1950s fled Prigorodnyi Raion for Ingushetia in November 1992 during bloody fighting between the two ethnic groups. Most do not dare go back, as those families who have done so are subject to constant harassment. Moscow is currently preoccupied by the escalation of violence in other parts of the North Caucasus, most recently in Kabardino-Balkaria in October. And the embattled Ingush opposition is increasingly reluctant to make an issue of the republican leadership's disinclination to make its case more forcefully with the Russian leadership lest Ingushetian President Murat Zyazikov seize on that criticism as a pretext for further reprisals. Eyes On Kosovo How far separatist leaders and groups choose to push their agendas in 2006 could depend on Serbia and Montenegro's province of Kosovo. Talks could be held on the disputed province in early 2006. Neither the Armenian nor the Karabakh leadership is likely to settle for less than independent status for Karabakh unless or until a final decision is made denying Kosovo independence. If Kosovo does finally win independence, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia are likely to adduce that victory as setting a precedent that should also be applied to them -- regardless of the very real differences between those conflicts.",,,

""After our meeting with [Armenian] President [Robert] Kocharian [yesterday], we believe as firmly as ever that events are moving in the right direction. These are very tough negotiations and neither side has ever taken any position that I would characterize as soft,"" Mann said. ""But what you have to understand [and] what gives us hope as negotiators is that even though the sides are very tough-minded in putting their positions forward, we are seeing a desire on the part of each side to look towards an agreement. But that doesn't mean it will be easy."" France and the United States co-chair the OSCE Minsk Group of nations, which was set up in 1996 to help settle the conflict. The other co-chair is Russia.

Authorities say 94 percent of those Armenian voters who cast their ballots on 27 November supported the legal changes proposed by President Robert Kocharian. But the opposition has accused the government of rigging the vote and harassing its election observers. Hundreds of opposition protesters gathered near the Materadaran building, Yerevan's library of ancient manuscripts. The demonstrators called on President Robert Kocharian to step down and vowed to keep pressure on the government so that the constitutional changes are not signed into law.

She said law-enforcement officers were visible everywhere, but there were no reported incidents. Former Prime Minister Aram Sargsian, now a leader of the Justice (Atarutyun) opposition parliamentary group, told the cheering crowd that opposition parties have approved a resolution giving Kocharian's government until 2 December to annul the outcome of the referendum, or face further street protests. Sargsian also cautioned the authorities against triggering a revolution similar to those that took place in Georgia and Ukraine in the past two years. He said: ""We will have the most civilized revolution possible. The government is forcing us to take these kind of steps.

It also quoted Feliks Khachatrian, an opposition representative in the election commission, as saying that no less than 1 million votes have been falsified. The opposition has also questioned the 65-percent turnout figure given by the authorities. Observers from the Council of Europe have cast doubt on the turnout figures, saying they did not correspond with the ""extremely low voting activity"" they noted on referendum day. The U.S. State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs expressed similar concerns in a statement released on 29 November. The statement, which was posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, calls upon the Armenian government ""to investigate Council of Europe observer reports of serious abuses and fraud.""

Prague, 28 November 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Despite a visible lack of public interest in the vote on constitutional reform, Armenia's Central Election Commission said today that voter turnout had been a healthy 64 percent. And according to a preliminary count, 93 percent had voted ""Yes."" The figures have been greeted with derision by the opposition, which before the referendum had called for a boycott. Anecdotal accounts from around the country lend some support to the claim that the turnout was generally low. They paint a picture of voter apathy and empty polling stations.

The campaign was meant to begin with a rally in central Yerevan over the weekend. In the event, only around 1500 people reportedly turned up. Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian could not resist the temptation to gloat.

Among the first voters who cast their ballots was President Robert Kocharian.Addressing reporters at a Yerevan polling station, he implicitly urged Armenian citizens to back changes that he described as democratic.""Today, people in Armenia face this choice -- either to have more balance of power between the branches of government, or to keep a strong presidential system,"" Kocharian said.To add weight to his remarks, Kocharian openly displayed his ""Yes"" ballot paper before television cameras.Opposition parliamentarian Viktor Dalakian criticized the gesture as an infringement of the existing legislation.""Kocharian has violated the Second Article of the Law on Referendums and Article Three of the constitution. These articles forbid open voting. By openly voting, the president is actually instructing others to vote 'Yes.' We regard this as a violation,"" Dalakian said.In theory, the proposed changes are meant to transfer part of the president's prerogatives to the parliament, the government, and strengthen the judiciary. They will also allow millions of diaspora Armenians to obtain citizenship in the Southern Caucasus country.Foreign SupportThe European Union, the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, and the United States have backed the proposed changes, saying they are vital to the reform process in Armenia. On paper at least, the changes are in line with the commitments Armenia undertook when it joined the Council of Europe in 2001.Opposition leaders say Kocharian has no right to modify the constitution. They say that's because he came to power in 1998 and has consolidated his rule through rigged presidential and legislative polls. They have called for a boycott, claiming the changes in reality aim at strengthening Kocharian's powersYesterday, several hundred people demonstrated in central Yerevan to denounce the upcoming vote.Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian -- whom many in Armenia see as a potential successor to Kocharian -- today ridiculed the opposition for failing to gather larger crowds against the referendum.""If I organize any meeting and cannot have at least 1,000 people there in attendance, I would not commit suicide, of course. But I would definitely be very ashamed and unable to look into people's eyes,"" Sargsian said.Regional political analysts believe apathy among Armenian voters is the greatest challenge faced by Kocharian and his political allies. RFE/RL's Armenian Service reports that 200,000 voters have taken part in the vote as of 1200 local time. The polls close at 2000 local time.To take effect, the constitutional changes must be endorsed by at least one-third of Armenia's 2.3 million registered voters and 50 percent of the actual voters.To boost the turnout, the government earlier this month printed copies of the draft constitution, saying it would try to deliver them to every single family in the country.Claiming the government will be unable to secure a high turnout, the opposition says it suspects authorities of seeking to rig the vote.It has threatened to take to the streets in case of fraud.Kocharian today said the referendum will be ""free and fair"" and pledged to respect any outcome of the vote.",,,

But the opposition is calling for a boycott of the vote and is urging Armenians to demonstrate in protest against the government instead. Opposition leaders say the issue for them is not so much constitutional change as regime change. Could Armenia go the same way as Georgia and Ukraine and add another chapter to the history of the ""colored revolutions,"" or is the government strong enough to emerge triumphant from the constitutional vote? Prague, 23 November, 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The Armenian opposition is talking a good fight. It is boycotting the 27 November referendum, it says, because the vote is a pretense of democracy. Former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovanissian, who has joined the call for a boycott, described the government this week as a ""regime that supports thieves, murderers, and corrupt individuals."" Like other opposition leaders, Hovanissian is calling for a campaign of ""civil disobedience."" ""From the afternoon of Friday, 25th November, we will transform [Yerevan's] Opera Square into an arena of freedom,"" Hovanissian said. ""I invite all citizens of the Republic of Armenia to take part in a civil-assembly initiative that on November 27th will become a powerful national demonstration."" Yet, the opposition finds itself out on a limb. The European Union, the Council of Europe, and the United States have described the proposed changes to the constitution as vital to the process of reform. Yesterday, the president of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, Rene van der Linden, effectively threw his weight against the opposition by urging all voters to participate. It was, he said, an opportunity for Armenians to show their commitment to Europe. Failure of the referendum due to a low turnout would be a major setback for Armenia's progress in fulfilling some of the most important commitments the country made when joining the Council of Europe. The Venice Commission, which advises the Council of Europe on constitutional law, gave its support to the package of constitutional amendments contained in the referendum in July after the Armenian authorities accepted most of its recommendations. On paper, at least, the changes would transfer many powers from the president to the parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the judiciary. They would also strengthen respect for human rights. But Aghas Yenokyan, an independent political analyst in Yerevan, explains that the opposition has lost faith in the democratic process in Armenia. ""The laws on the constitution are not very important thing for the reality in Armenia,"" Yenokian said. ""The opposition doesn't believe much in the changes that would occur during the democratic process. They know that there is just one way -- and actually they were encouraged by our neighbors in CIS countries (Eds. a reference to the Rose Revolution in Georgia) -- to change the current situation, which is [the exertion of pressure] by the public, by demonstrations."" In reality, though, the biggest obstacle facing the safe passage of the amendments is not so much the opposition boycott as popular apathy. At least one-third of the total electorate must vote in its favor -- and more than 50 percent of those who actually vote. It could be a tall order, at least according to recent opinion polls, which suggest there will be a low turnout. President Robert Kocharian needs to overcome both voter indifference and ignorance of the constitution. This week, he stepped up his campaign to win support. ""We have quite a large quantity of printed copies of the draft, which we will try to deliver to every single family in Armenia, so that out public gets the chance to draw its own conclusions not just from commentary but directly for itself,"" Kocharian said. His supporters say they are confident. Galust Sahakian, who is a senior member of the ruling coalition, is predicting an overwhelming victory in the poll. ""Judging by the meetings I have had with people, as well as what my own intuition and analysis tell me, I'd say it will be about 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of a 'yes' vote,"" Sahakian said. It is claims like that, though, that convince both opposition supporters and neutrals alike that the government has no intention of ensuring a free and fair referendum. Their confidence is further undermined by the virtual absence of foreign observers. The Council of Europe is sending just seven, while the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which had more than 600 observers at the recent parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan, is not deploying any for the Armenian referendum because it has had no formal invitation from the authorities. The odds are stacked, it seems, against the opposition. Its position enjoys no international support, it has had limited access to media in Armenia to explain its case and, just like the government, it has to overcome popular apathy. Political analyst Aghas Yenokian is dismissive of the opposition's chances. ""I think the opposition will not succeed, they will fail, they cannot make [a] really big demonstration,"" Yenokian said. ""Kocharian will go to cheat the results because -- as far as I can understand the situation in Armenia -- people just don't care about the constitutional changes."" So where will the referendum leave Armenia? Failure would deliver a remarkable blow to the prestige of Robert Kocharian and his government. But it would also leave the country with a constitution that is widely regarded as seriously flawed. In Armenia, though, few doubt the published results will reveal a government triumph. Whether or not the amendments will change anything for the better is another matter.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1063206.html,Armenia 10 Questions About The Constitutional Amendments ,"November 21, 2005 14:48 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) The following is a direct translation of a document published by the Armenian government on the constitutional referendum --> /featuresarticle/2005/11/E9ACC5BD-4FC9-470A-BCA5-53DDDDBB1E72.html that is to take place on 27 November. In Place Of A Forward The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia that was adopted in 1995 has fulfilled its primary purpose. On the foundation of that constitution were laid the economic, social, and political structures of the independent Republic of Armenia. The constitution allowed us to avoid numerous political upheavals and to overcome a crisis of power. But there are no constitutions set in stone. Civic life is developing, and the need to perfect the mechanisms of the constitutional system has arisen so that those mechanisms can remain the moving force of development. The constitutional amendments are called upon to create a balance between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of power, to secure their independence, and to review the dominant role in regard to them of the president of the republic. This will strengthen the democratic foundations for the development of the country and strengthen the real guarantees of the individual and the citizen. No one will be able to place himself above the law. It is extremely important to abolish the ban on dual citizenship. This most important question must be resolved in accordance with the law, a process that will allow [us] to implement a more flexible policy in this area and to involve our co-nationals from the diaspora in the life of the country. All this will give Armenia the possibility of taking its place before the international community as a democratic state, and will help to integrate Armenia into various international structures. As a result, political, economic, and legal reforms will be implemented, the importance of which for both the present and for future generations is difficult to overestimate. It is likewise of note that the draft law on amending the constitution was approved by the [Council of Europe's] Venice Commission. Consequently, adopting that draft by means of a referendum will be an important step on the road toward the integration of our country into the civilized world, and it will contribute toward raising its international authority. The aim of this brochure is to inform [voters] in an accessible and simple way about the basic provisions envisioned by the draft law on amending and amplifying the constitution. 1. What new possibilities do the proposed constitutional changes create for the development of the individual? The draft law on amending and amplifying the constitution envisages incorporating into the constitution a series of new human and civil rights, expanding those rights and freedoms enshrined in the existing constitution, and adding to it new obligations on the part of the state aimed at respecting and guaranteeing human rights and freedoms. All these changes serve one purpose: to strengthen the real position of persons and of citizens of the Republic of Armenia and in doing so to promote the free development of the individual. So, it is planned to augment the package of human and civil rights by including in addition the right of each person to address statements or proposals -- with the aim of defending his personal or society's interests -- to the competent state organs, organs of local government, and to specific officials; and to receive an appropriate response within a reasonable time period (Article 27.1); the right to defend the interests of the consumer (Article 33.2); and the right to live in a healthy environment (Article 33.2). No less important is the provision according to which forced labor is banned in the Republic of Armenia and children under the age of 16 may not be permanently employed (Article 32). It is proposed to redesignate as human rights a series of rights that are qualified as civil rights in the existing constitution. This affects the following rights: the right to freedom of movement (Article 25); to conduct peaceful, unarmed assemblies, meetings, marches, and demonstrations (Article 25); to the free choice of work (Article 32); to a satisfactory standard of living for one's family (Article 34); to social security in old age or in the event of disability, illness, or other circumstances (Article 37); and the right to education (Article 39). Of exceptionally important significance are the changes it is proposed to introduce to Articles 14 and 42 of the constitution. The amendments to Article 14 oblige the state to respect and defend human dignity as part of the indivisible basis of human rights and freedoms. According to the proposed amendment to Article 42, restrictions on human and civil rights and freedoms may not exceed the limitations imposed by the international obligations of the Republic of Armenia. 2. In democratic states, particular importance is attached to the existence of effective legal mechanisms for defending human rights and freedoms. What will change in this regard if the constitutional amendments are adopted? There are numerous known cases in which the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the constitution were a mere formality and ""existed only on paper"" insofar as effective legal mechanisms were not prescribed to defend them. Cogent proof of this is the human and civil rights and freedoms enshrined in the Soviet-era constitutions. It should be noted that the legal mechanisms for defending human and civil rights and freedoms that are written into the existing constitution are to be augmented by three new provisions, the effectiveness of which has been demonstrated by the experience of foreign countries.a) In line with the proposed change to Article 18, in order to defend his rights and freedoms everyone is entitled, in accordance with the legally established procedure, to receive the assistance of a human-rights ombudsman. International experience shows that this institution [of human-rights ombudsman] is an effective means of defending human rights and freedoms. It was therefore appropriate that after World War II it was introduced in the constitutions of numerous countries.b) Another amendment to the same article of the constitution envisages the right of every person, in accordance with international agreements to which the Republic of Armenia is a signatory, to appeal to international organs for the defense of his rights and freedoms. The use of that possibility will doubtless contribute to bringing our existing legal mechanisms for defending human rights and freedoms into compliance with international -- in the first instance European -- values, principles, and norms.c) Under the amendment to Article 101, any person may appeal to the Constitutional Court in connection with a specific case in which there is a final legal ruling, when all other means of legal defense have been exhausted, and when the constitutionality of the provision of the law applied by that legal ruling is questioned. The need for this change is dictated by the fact that, in specific cases, the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the constitution are circumscribed or infringed upon by the law currently in force. If this amendment is adopted, every citizen will be able to challenge in the Constitutional Court the constitutionality of such laws or of their individual provisions. 3. What is the essence of the restrictions imposed on the presidential powers and what is the rationale for them? In a semi-presidential system, the president is in a position to seek to maintain a balance and to safeguard the normal functioning of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches only if he has the constitutionally guaranteed possibility of exerting influence on the activities of all three branches of power. At the same time, it is clear that the president may not deprive the branches of power of the possibility of acting independently, and from this angle the amendments are intended to substantially limit the powers of the president of the republic in his relations with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. In the relations between the president and the parliament, it is envisaged to abolish the exclusive right of the president of the republic to dissolve the National Assembly. In addition, it is the position of the parliament, not that of the president, that is decisive when it comes to forming the government. It is envisaged to transfer to the National Assembly other aspects of the powers of the president of the republic. Thus, under the present constitution it is the president who appoints and dismisses the prosecutor-general at the proposal of the prime minister, whereas the constitutional amendments envisage that the National Assembly will appoint the prosecutor-general at the proposal of the president of the republic (Article 103). One more example: under the existing constitution, the president can convene an emergency session of the National Assembly, while after the amendments have been passed that right will devolve on the chairman of the National Assembly (Article 70). In line with the constitutional amendments the president will not establish the structure of the government or monitor the decisions of the government, and he will no longer head the Council of Justice. 4. How will the changes affect the interaction between the president and the government? Significant limitations will be imposed on the powers of the president with regard to the formation and activities of the government. If according to the existing constitution the president of the republic can appoint and dismiss the prime minister at his discretion, the amendments envisage that on the basis of the distribution of deputies' mandates and consultations with parliamentary factions the president appoints as prime minister a person who enjoys the trust of the majority of deputies (Article 55.4). In other words, it is the opinion of the National Assembly, not that of the president, that is crucial in appointing the prime minister. It is planned to abolish the president's right to dismiss the prime minister. It should be noted that under the existing constitution, the president of the republic is not only the head of state but in fact also heads the government. At the prime minister's suggestion, the president of the republic determines the structure and priorities of the government, convenes and chairs its sessions (the prime minister may convene and chair a government session only at the behest of the president), and he monitors the decisions of the government. In line with the amendments the structure of the government will be determined by law (Article 85). From now on government sessions will be convened and chaired by the prime minister. The decisions of the government will have legal force without being signed by the president of the republic. The president may only suspend implementation of government decisions for one month and ask the Constitutional Court to rule on whether they comply with the constitution (Article 86). These amendments have one single purpose -- to form an independently functioning government that is answerable to the National Assembly, not to the president of the republic. 5. How will the role of the parliament be strengthened after these changes? If under the existing constitution the dominant role in the system of political and legal institutions belonged to the president, then in line with these amendments it is the parliament that will receive the dominant role in that interaction. Thus, if the opinions of the president and the parliament majority on the question of forming the government and appointing the prime minister do not coincide, then it is the opinion of the parliament that proves decisive, because Point 4 of Article 55 stipulates clearly that the president is obliged to appoint that candidate who enjoys the trust of the parliamentary majority. The president will no longer have the exclusive right to dissolve the National Assembly. The parliament will appoint the prosecutor-general, the chairman of the Audit Chamber, and the chairman of the Central Bank, and it will select the human rights ombudsman. If according to the existing constitution the government is answerable to the president of the republic, in accordance with the changes the government will be answerable solely to the parliament. In contrast to the current procedure for requiring members of the government to respond to parliament's questions, parliament will receive the right to adopt decisions on the basis of those responses, including a vote of no confidence in the government. One could cite numerous other examples, but these are sufficient for it to become clear that in accordance with the constitutional amendments Armenia will move from the model of strong presidential power toward a parliamentary republic. 6. Why are the provisions on presidential immunity written into the constitution, and what will the legal consequences of those provisions be? We are not talking about total immunity for the president but for immunity for those actions that result from his formal status. The powers of the president of the republic are exhaustively defined by the constitution. It is these powers that limit the immunity of the president , because after expiry of his term the president can be brought to justice for actions that are not connected with his formal status (Article 56.1, Part 2). In addition, the president of the republic can be removed from office for treason and other grave crimes regardless of whether his criminal actions are connected with his official position. He can also be brought to trial after his removal from office. There are similar provisions with regard to presidential immunity in the constitutions of other states, including Romania (Article 95), Bulgaria (Article 102), Lithuania (Article 86), Poland (Article 145), and others. The purpose of this is to protect the president of the republic from politically motivated criminal prosecution. 7. Society has always been harshly critical of the legal system. What amendments are to be made to the constitution with regard to the courts in order to improve people's trust in the legal system? Improving the work of the courts is a complex problem that requires the implementation of economic, social, organizational, and educational measures. In present conditions particular attention is paid to ensuring the independence of courts and judges. This is the basic aim of the proposed constitutional amendments. Under the existing constitution the president of the republic is chairman of the Council of Justice and the justice minister and the prosecutor-general serve as deputy chairmen. Essentially, by means of the Council of Justice the president oversees the appointment of judges and assigns specific questions to them. If the constitutional amendments are adopted, it is the chairman of the Appeals Court who will chair sessions of the Council of Justice, although he will not have voting rights. This will significantly reduce the possibilities for the president of the republic and representatives of the executive to influence decisions made by the Council of Justice, which will in fact become something like an organ of self-government for judges. The role of the Appeals Court in the legal system will change drastically. According to the proposed amendment to Article 92, the Appeals Court is called upon to ensure the uniform application of the law. The aim of the proposed amendment is to limit the scope for judges to interpret the law arbitrarily and hand down arbitrary judgments, to exclude the possibility of judges handing down diverging rulings and verdicts in identical cases. The proposed amendment to Article 18 of the constitution will also serve to improve the work of the courts. In accordance with the international obligations of the Republic of Armenia, that amendment gives everyone the right to appeal to international organs to defend his human rights and freedoms. We have already touched on that. We will add only that the practical implementation of that provision will provide for the real influence of international legal organs on the functioning of the Armenian legal system and will help to ensure that the work of our courts corresponds to international criteria and norms. 8. What changes are to be introduced into the procedure of forming and the activities of other institutions of state power? There are quite a large number of such changes. The human-rights defender (ombudsman) acquires constitutional status (Article 82.1) as does the National Commission for Television and Radio (Article 83.2). Those institutions were created, and they currently function, on the basis of the law. But international practice shows that the work of those institutions is more productive when the procedure for their formation and functioning and the guarantees of their independence are written into the constitution. Also envisaged is a partial shifting of powers from the president to the National Assembly in connection with the formation of those institutions. Thus, if under the existing law it is the president of the republic who appoints the human-rights ombudsman, the constitutional amendments envision that in future it is the parliament that will do so. At present the president of the republic appoints all the members of the National Commission for Television and Radio. If the constitutional amendments are approved, he will appoint half the members of that commission and the National Assembly will appoint the other half. The constitutional amendments also envisage the creation of a Control Chamber whose chairman the National Assembly will appoint. This will be an independent institution that will not answer either to the president of the republic or to the National Assembly or to the government. It will be called upon to monitor the use of budget funds, and also of state and public property. 9. Some changes are also envisaged in the relations between the national government and local governments. What is the nature of and the rationale for those changes? Fundamental changes are envisaged in this sphere. Their basic goal is to strengthen local self-government and to increase significantly the independence of local organs of government. Changes are envisaged to a number of different aspects of the work of those institutions. One set of changes is aimed at strengthening the economic foundations of local government. The following provisions are intended to serve that purpose: a) land that is part of the administrative territory of a community -- except for land that is essential to state needs and land that is the property of individuals or legal entities -- belongs to the community (Article 105.1); b) the community's sources of finance should be sufficient to enable it to exercise its powers (Article 106); c) the powers delegated by the state to the community must be financed from the state budget (Article 196). These new provisions are intended to guarantee the financial independence of organs of local self-government from the organs of state power. The terms for which local governments are elected is increased from three years to four. It is envisaged that community heads should participate directly in local government and try to resolve questions by means of a local referendum. The process by which the government may remove a local community head is made more complicated. In contrast to the existing constitution, the amendments envisage that in circumstances laid down by law the government may remove a local community head from office only on the basis of a ruling by the Constitutional Court (Article 109). The existing constitutional restriction that sets at 15 the maximum number of members of a council of elders has been abolished , which means the number of members of such councils can be increased. 10. What status will Yerevan have after the adoption of the constitutional amendments? Under the existing constitution Yerevan has the status of a province. The internal contradiction here is clear. If the amendments are adopted Yerevan will acquire the natural status, that of a community (Article 108). This means that the capital will have its own budget and will be able to draw on its own funds to solve problems that affect the whole city. The city will have an elected mayor who will answer in the first instance to the population. This will make the mayor of the capital independent of the organs of state power to a certain degree. The city will have a representative body that will endorse the draft city budget and monitor budget spending and the activities of the mayor. Respected fellow countrymen and women! We hope that this brochure will help to give you a more precise understanding of the constitutional changes. The time for you to choose is approaching. Make up your mind, take part in the 27 November national referendum and make the correct choice. (Translation by Liz Fuller)",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1063110.html,Armenia Both Sides Gear Up For Constitutional Referendum ,"November 21, 2005 11:55 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) Armenia's estimated 2.4 million registered voters will be called upon to vote on 27 November in a referendum on a package of draft constitutional amendments. Passage will require that a minimum of one-third of those voters approve the amendments -- which the United States, European Union, and Council of Europe have described as ""vital"" for the ongoing reform process. But most opposition parties reject the amendments, arguing that the Armenian authorities themselves lack legitimacy, and therefore do not have the right to reform the country's basic law. The opposition is therefore urging voters to boycott the referendum, the outcome of which they accuse the leadership of planning to falsify. The process of drafting the amendments and their passage by parliament has been protracted and acrimonious. It has, moreover, been overshadowed by the failure of a previous constitutional referendum two years ago. On that occasion, just over 52 percent of registered voters participated, with ""yes"" votes only narrowly exceeding ""no"" votes, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on 28 May 2003. In September 2004, three separate draft packages of proposed amendments were submitted to the Armenian parliament, prepared respectively by the ruling three-party coalition, the pro-government United Labor Party, and veteran oppositionist Arshak Sadoyan, leader of the National Democratic Party. Those three drafts were then submitted for evaluation to the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, which assessed the first two as an improvement on the present constitution; but the Venice Commission rejected Sadoyan's as failing to address certain crucial issues related to human rights and the judiciary, according to Noyan Tapan on 22 December. The commission further suggested a number of changes to the government draft, specifically with regard to expanding the powers of the legislature, limiting the president's authority to appoint and dismiss judges, and introducing elections for the post of Yerevan mayor. In early May, the Armenian parliament approved a slightly revised version of the draft prepared by the ruling coalition. Sadoyan promptly denounced that draft as ""evil"" and warned that it could lead to an ""Asian-style dictatorship,"" according to Noyan Tapan on 13 May. He called on all political forces to reject that draft. In seemingly partial agreement, the Council of Europe's Venice Commission expressed in late May its ""deep dissatisfaction"" at the authorities' failure to take into account its previous recommendations (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 1 June 2005). That negative assessment prompted the two opposition parliamentary factions -- the Artarutiun bloc and the National Accord Party (AMK) -- to advise their members to reject the proposed changes, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on 31 May. In late June, Armenia submitted to the Venice Commission an amended draft that addressed the commission's three main concerns. The commission approved the revised draft on 21 July, but opposition parties nonetheless continued to demand further changes and boycotted the subsequent parliament debates in August and September at which the final draft was approved. Yet despite their shared disapproval of the draft amendments and apprehension that the government would resort to subterfuge to ensure their approval by the population at large, the opposition initially failed to agree on a course of action. Even during the emergency debate in late August in which the draft was approved in its first and second readings, Artarutiun and the AMK announced that they rejected the draft and would urge voters to vote against them, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Days later, they announced plans to stage rallies across the country in an attempt to persuade voters to reject the proposed changes. But on 16 November, just 11 days before the referendum, most opposition parties shifted tactics and decided to urge voters to boycott. Opposition leaders, first and foremost former Prime Minister and Hanrapetutiun party Chairman Aram Sargsian, repeatedly accused the authorities of seeking to falsify the outcome of the plebiscite and warned that attempts to do so would trigger a spontaneous uprising and the collapse of the regime. ""We will be living in a new Armenia on 28 November,"" Sargsian declared on 11 November in the town of Yeghard. The Armenian authorities too launched an intensive public-relations campaign to drum up support for the proposed constitutional amendments, for which 21 political parties plus the People's Deputy parliamentary faction expressed their backing in an 18 October statement, Noyan Tapan reported. Some aspects of that campaign, such as orders issued to teachers in Yerevan by the city mayor to persuade students and their parents of the merits of the planned changes, have fueled opposition suspicions that the authorities plan to rig the outcome of the vote. And while television stations are not charging for government-sponsored advertising promoting the constitutional changes, the opposition has encountered problems in securing paid airtime to argue its case against, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on 31 October. While Armenian officials are unanimous in insisting that the voting will be free and fair, and that they will not resort to rigging to obtain the required minimum number of votes in favor of the proposed changes, differences of opinion have emerged within the ruling coalition over the likely impact of failure. Prime Minister Andranik Markarian said on 6 October that speculation that the failure of the referendum would necessitate the government's resignation is misplaced, Noyan Tapan reported. Galust Sahakian, who heads the parliamentary faction of Markarian's Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), suggested that it would be better for the draft not to pass than for it to be pushed through by means of violations. But Armen Rustamian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun argued on 22 September that failure to pass the amendments would mean ""failure for Armenia"" insofar as it would, he suggested, be construed by the European Union and the Council of Europe as a rejection of Europe and of European values, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. In a 28 October address to students at Yerevan State University that was subsequently posted in English translation on the Foreign Ministry's website (http://www.armeniaforeignministry.am), Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian sought to demolish the opposition's arguments against the proposed changes and the ""myths"" that he said have grown up around some of them. Oskanian dismissed as ""excuses with no underpinnings"" the argument that the present Armenian leadership does not have the right to reform the constitution because it was not legitimately elected and has repeatedly violated it. He further dismissed as ""myths"" claims that the revised constitution would make it possible for the parliament to endorse changes in the country's borders, without the issue being put to a nationwide referendum; would give non-citizens the chance to buy unlimited quantities of land in Armenia; would make it possible, by removing the existing ban on dual citizenship, for Diaspora Armenians to play the decisive role in running the country; and would grant the incumbent president immunity from prosecution and lift the existing ban on a president serving more than two consecutive terms. (President Robert Kocharian's second term in office expires in early 2008.) Senior HHK lawmaker Samvel Nikoyan reminded voters in Armenia's northwestern Shirak district on 17 November while seeking to persuade the population to endorse the proposed constitutional changes that Kocharian has repeatedly vowed that he will not seek a third term. ""All the political forces that have backed [the president] until now are of the opinion that the constitution must be respected and that no president should have the right to be reelected for a third term,"" Nikoyan said. Kocharian's national security adviser, Garnik Isagulian, affirmed on 16 November, ""I can say for certain that we will get a 'yes' vote. We will get more votes than are required by law,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. HHK faction head Sahakian predicted on 18 November that the ratio of ""yes"" to ""no"" votes will be 80:20, Noyan Tapan reported. AMK Chairman Artashes Geghamian proclaimed with similar confidence on 16 November that ""the constitutional changes are doomed to be rejected by our people. That is obvious to all of us."" According to an opinion poll conducted by the Vox Populi center in Yerevan in early November and summarized on 18 November by Noyan Tapan, 54 percent of respondents intend to participate in the referendum, of whom 46.6 percent said they will vote ""yes."" Whether that comparatively low level of support is due to deep-rooted discontent with the present leadership remains unclear. Equally unclear is what percentage of voters have a clear understanding of the changes they are being asked to approve, especially as voters are required to say ""yes"" or ""no"" to the entire package rather than to vote on individual changes or, as was the case in the 2002 Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, on groups of proposed amendments. That referendum entailed approving or rejecting eight distinct packages of changes relating to such issues as the conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections, the conduct of referendums, the restructuring of the government, and judicial reform, according to zerkalo.az on 30 August 2002.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1062322.html,Armenia Kocharian Presses EU For Quicker Regional Outreach ,"October 21, 2005 13:57 GMT",,,"Armenian President Robert Kocharian (file photo) Armenian President Robert Kocharian is on a two-day visit to Brussels to press the European Union for a quicker rapprochement with the south Caucasus countries despite recent problems between the EU and Baku. Azerbaijan has angered EU member state Cyprus by allowing commercial flights to the internationally unrecognized Northern Cyprus. The tussle has thrown a spanner into EU preparations to extend neighborhood policy ""action plans"" to the region. Brussels, 20 October 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The problems between Azerbaijan and EU-member Cyprus come as a very unwelcome development for Armenia. The EU is in the habit of preferring to deal with entire regions, not single countries at a time. As a result, both Armenia and Georgia have discovered that their EU neighbourhood ""action plans"" -- paving the way for closer political cooperation and greater economic aid -- are held hostage to the spat between Baku and Nicosia. Initial hopes that the ""action plans"" could be negotiated and signed by the end of the year have begun to recede. ""It would be strange if the start of the planned talks between the[European] Commission and Armenia on the draft action plan remainedblocked by the dispute between Cyprus and Azerbaijan over flights toNorthern Cyprus, since that dispute does not concern Armenia."" The unhappiness in the reactions of Armenian diplomats has been palpable in recent weeks. The country's president, Robert Kocharian, who began a two-day visit to Brussels and the EU's headquarters yesterday, is making sure that unhappiness is being felt by his hosts. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana offered solace, but no guarantees of a quick breakthrough. ""I hope very much that the neighbourhood policy that we have established in the European Union will be a constructive and positive help for Armenia in their relations with the European Union,"" he said. ""As you know still we have not completely started the negotiations, but we hope very much that will be done in the foreseeable future."" EU member states retain full sovereignty in the area of external relations and a single country can theoretically block any decision. The Greek government of Cyprus held out for a long time before giving its consent to EU membership talks with Turkey. Nicosia is likely to face far lesser pressure in the EU in its dealings with Turkey's more remote ally Azerbaijan. Privately, EU diplomats have told RFE/RL that no decisions on the south Caucasus ""action plans"" will be made before Azerbaijani elections in November. Even so, officials indicate there are no guarantees of a breakthrough for Armenia and Georgia before the end of the year. Kocharian yesterday told EU officials that ""no country should pay the price for the problems of others."" He did draw support from Josep Borrell, the president of the European Parliament. ""It would be strange if the start of the planned talks between the [European] Commission and Armenia on the draft action plan remained blocked by the dispute between Cyprus and Azerbaijan over flights to Northern Cyprus, since that dispute does not concern Armenia. We have been talking about that with the president and I told him [of] my strong commitment that these talks should be starting at the planned [time]."" However, Borrell's support is of little practical value to Kocharian, as the parliament has no say in EU foreign policy decisions. Nevertheless, the parliament has a role to play in shaping the political climate in the EU and thus indirectly helps shape longer term decisions. Borrell yesterday pointed to earlier efforts by the parliament that helped secure the southern Caucasus an EU special representative, and forced the EU to include the three countries in the neighborhood policy. The European Parliament has also been vocal in calling on Turkey to open its border with Armenia and recognize the Armenian genocide. Borrell yesterday recalled that the parliament had adopted a resolution calling for the steps before EU entry talks were launched with Turkey. ""The parliament has already set out a declaration on the opening of negotiations with Turkey,"" Borrell said. ""We have already said whatever we think we should have said. And the opening of the border and the recognition of the Armenian genocide was [mentioned] in that resolution, that the parliament strongly requires these as a condition. But this is the point of view of the parliament, we will have to see."" Again, the European Parliament had no formal powers to affect the decision on Turkey. Its approval will be needed before Turkey can accede to the EU, but that vote is unlikely to take place before the middle of the next decade. Kocharian yesterday asked the EU to bring its influence to bear on Turkey to reopen the railroad to Georgia -- which passes through Armenia -- instead of building a new, direct link. Solana told Kocharian the EU will ""do its best."" However, last year diplomats told RFE/RL the EU was inclined to agree with Azerbaijani claims that the Armenian-Turkish border is one of the very few levers the international community has on Yerevan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Kocharian is due today to meet European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1061130.html,Azerbaijan From Showmanship To Brinkmanship ,"September 02, 2005 14:39 GMT",,,"President Aliyev is coming under increasing international pressure to hold free elections (AFP) In the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for 6 November, Azerbaijani leaders face an unenviable dilemma. On the one hand, they are under pressure from the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the United States to avoid the egregious violations and outright falsification that marred the elections of 1995, 1998, 2000, and 2003 and to deliver on their repeated pledges that this time around the vote will be transparent, free, and fair. And, on the other hand, they need to secure a comfortable parliamentary majority for the ruling Yeni Azerbaycan Party without sparking postelections protests on the lines of those that over the past two years have toppled entrenched regimes in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. The tactics and strategy selected to achieve that objective appear to contain elements of both showmanship and brinkmanship. Showmanship On 11 May, President Ilham Aliyev issued a decree outlining measures to improve the conduct of elections. The preamble to that decree admitted that contrary to the ""political will"" of the Azerbaijani authorities, previous elections were marred by ""illegalities,"" but it blamed those irregularities on the ""lack of professionalism"" and ""post-Soviet mentality"" of individual local officials and election commission members. (No effort has been made over the past two years to identify the individuals responsible for those ""irregularities"" and bring them to justice.) The first of 11 measures listed in President Aliyev's decree and intended to prevent a recurrence of procedural violations entailed programs to raise the professionalism and competence of the officials responsible for the organization of the election process and the vote count; the second was a warning to those officials that they will be held legally responsible for any infringements of the Election Law, such as hampering electioneering by opposition candidates or intervening in the voting process or vote count. The Azerbaijani leadership is thus apparently seeking to offload in advance the blame for possible violations on to regional officials, who will have to calculate which offense will be perceived as greater: failing to ensure at all costs the victory of the ruling party's candidate, or risking their superiors' opprobrium should international observers register and publicly condemn malpractice in voting stations under their jurisdiction. A third provision of President Aliyev's decree, ostensibly intended to contribute to the fairness of the election process, is the provision for the conduct of exit polls. Paradoxically, however, this provision could have the opposite effect if voters in rural areas, fearful of the wrath of the local authorities, claim to have voted for the YAP candidate when in fact they cast their votes for a member of the opposition. A glaring discrepancy between the actual division of ballots cast and the exit-poll results could impel local election commission members to bring the ""official"" tally into line with the inaccurate exit-poll data. Further aspects of the election campaign to date that could be construed as manifestations of showmanship include the lifting of long-standing restrictions on holding opposition demonstrations in Baku; registration of several controversial opposition candidates, first and foremost former parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliev; the MSK's 12 August appeal to the Armenian population of the breakaway unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to register to elect a candidate to represent the enclave in the next Azerbaijani parliament; and the belated launch, on 29 August, of a nominally independent public television station whose mandate requires it to provide equal access to both pro-government and opposition parliamentary candidates. On the same day as the MSK announced Guliev's registration, the office of Azerbaijan's prosecutor-general declared that it has stripped Guliev of his immunity from prosecution. Should he return to Baku from the United States, as he has pledged to do, he consequently risks arrest on charges of large-scale embezzlement. Following the 11 May presidential decree, in late June, under pressure from the international community, Azerbaijan's parliament adopted 43 amendments proposed by President Aliyev to the existing election law. Those amendments did not, however, include the most important changes called for by the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, nor did they increase opposition representation on election commissions at all levels, as the opposition had demanded. (The opposition demanded equal representation on election commissions, which the authorities rejected, accusing the opposition of thus seeking to prevent such commissions from adopting any decisions. Presidential-administration head Ramiiz Mekhtiev told day.az on 23 July that the opposition's objective in demanding equal representation was the desire to be in a position to paralyze the functioning of election commissions and thus sabotage the entire election process. The Council of Europe called for appointing an additional opposition representative to the MSK to give a total of seven opposition and nine pro-government members.) ...And Brinkmanship The presidential administration appears to regard the combined provisions of the presidential decree and the amended election law as a panacea against election fraud -- provided lower-level bureaucrats abide by its provisions. Proceeding from that conviction, the Azerbaijani leadership has apparently switched from showmanship to brinkmanship, arguing that additional measures to preclude fraud are unnecessary. For example, Ali Hasanov, who heads the political department within the presidential administration, told day.az on 1 September that the authorities do not consider it necessary to accede to the proposal, made most recently during a visit to Baku late last month by Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) Chairman Rene van der Linden, to mark voters' fingers with indelible ink to prevent multiple voting. Further, uglier manifestations of brinkmanship include the recourse for the first time in an Azerbaijani election to ""doubles,"" meaning the nomination in a given constituency of additional candidates with the same name as a prominent oppositionist. The first target for such confusion is former presidential adviser Edar Namazov, one of the leaders of the opposition alliance Yeni Siyaset, who will compete against two namesakes in a Baku constituency. The questionable allegations of collusion with Armenian special services brought by the Prosecutor-General's Office against Ruslan Bashirli, chairman of the opposition youth movement Yeni Fikir, fall into the same category. Allegations of treason by association were subsequently brought against Bashirli's mentor Ali Kerimli, chairman of the progressive wing of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party, one of three opposition parties aligned in the Azadlyg bloc. Some observers have construed the vilification campaign launched against Kerimli as an attempt to split Azadlyg by creating the impression that the authorities consider Kerimli, rather than fellow Azadlyg leader and Musavat party Chairman Isa Gambar (who lost to President Aliyev in the October 2003 presidential ballot), as the most popular and influential candidate, and by extension as a threat to be neutralized. The final list of candidates is to be announced on 7 September; manifestations of both brinkmanship and ""black PR"" are likely to multiply in the two months remaining before the election.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1061038.html,CIS Death Notices Serve To Revive Moribund Organization ,"August 30, 2005 13:46 GMT",,,"Will one of these leaders destroy the CIS? Meeting in the wilds of Belarus on 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus announced the creation of a new Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on the ruins of the crumbling USSR. Two weeks later, on 21 December 1991, the presidents of 11 former Soviet republics (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan) met in Almaty and signed a protocol to that declaration affirming their countries' membership in the CIS. The ink was barely dry on those signatures when skeptics began questioning how long that new union would last. Shortly after its first anniversary, in January 1993, U.S. expert Paul Goble memorably dubbed the CIS ""the world's largest fig leaf,"" alluding to the need to conceal the final collapse of Moscow's influence over the country it had controlled since the USSR was first created in 1922. Russian politicians, however, including President Vladimir Putin, have tended to put a positive spin on the emergence of the CIS as a mechanism for ensuring a ""civilized divorce,"" in other words, for enabling the various former Soviet Socialist Republics to agree, without bloodshed, to go their separate ways.Initially, every effort was made to preserve cooperation between CIS member states at a level close to that which existed within the USSR. In May 1992, six CIS member states (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) signed the CIS Collective Security Treaty pledging to intervene collectively to counter an attack on any one of them; a CIS armed forces general staff continued to exist until mid-1993. But from the outset, the CIS was split into two factions, the first of which (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) was markedly more committed than the others (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine). Azerbaijan quit the CIS in 1992 following the advent to power of the Azerbaijan Popular Front (AHC), but rejoined in late 1993 after the AHC leadership was ousted. Georgia was coerced into joining in late 1993 by Russian threats to withhold energy supplies.In January 1993, the CIS presidents adopted a new charter and statutes, and in September of that year they reached agreement in principle on creating an economic union. But already the centrifugal tendencies that precipitated the collapse of the USSR were evident within the CIS: Uzbek President Islam Karimov complained in April 1993 that the CIS had already adopted 270 documents that his country found unacceptable and would not abide by. Writing in ""Rossiiskie vesti"" in December 1996, one commentator note that ""implementing one [CIS] agreement is more difficult than signing 10 new ones.""The process of signing ever more documents that were never implemented nonetheless continued for several years, until at a CIS summit in late March 1997, hard-line Russian political scientists Andranik Migranian and Konstantin Zatulin unveiled a program intended to restore Russia's status as unacknowledged leader within the CIS. Warning that the CIS risked becoming ""a fiction,"" they advocated radical measures, including the deliberate destabilization of the domestic political situation within selected CIS states (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan), to reverse the perceived drift of the former Soviet republics away from Russia. They argued that the founders of the CIS had committed a fundamental error by selecting the wrong (from Russia's point of view) model, namely EU-style integration, and that reunification of the two Germanies would have been far more appropriate.That blueprint set off alarm bells across the CIS, and served as the catalyst for the foundation in late 1997 of GUAM, a loose geo-political alignment encompassing Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova; Uzbekistan acceded to GUAM in April 1999.In a possible acknowledgement that the scare tactics espoused by Migranian and Zatulin had proven counterproductive, in April 1998, Russian oligarch Boris Berezovskii was appointed CIS executive secretary with a brief to persuade the CIS presidents to endorse, and then implement, a blueprint for closer and more effective economic cooperation, beginning with the creation of one or more CIS free-trade zones. (An agreement in principle to form such zones had been signed in April 1994, but shared the same fate as hundreds of other collective statements of intent that were signed but never implemented.) Meanwhile, the ""core"" CIS states -- Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, which had formed a customs union in 1995 to which Kyrgyzstan acceded the following year -- were mulling the creation of a Single Economic Space together with Ukraine.Two developments seemed to infuse new vitality into the CIS, albeit only briefly: the election of Vladimir Putin to succeed Boris Yeltsin as Russian president, and the creation in November 2001 of a CIS Antiterrrorism Center. Then in 2003, the CIS drafted, but failed to endorse, a new 10-part plan for expanding economic cooperation, the first stage of which was to be the creation of a free-trade zone. That failure to move decisively forward prompted Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev, one of the most enthusiastic proponents of closer CIS integration in both the economic and political spheres, to propose at a CIS summit in Astana in September 2004 transforming the Single Economic Space into the nucleus of a ""super-CIS"" while the remaining CIS members confined their cooperation within that body to the military sphere. Nazarbaev also proposed other measures to streamline the CIS and make it more effective, including abolishing the CIS Economic Court and several other bodies and reducing the staff of the CIS Executive Committee from 220 to 140, according to ""Vremya novostei"" on 17 September 2004. The summit participants agreed to reach a final decision on Nazarbaev's reform proposals within 12 months.In the event, however, last week's CIS summit in Kazan failed yet again to yield a consensus on reform; the participants decided to readdress the issue at their next summit, tentatively scheduled for 2006 in Belarus. (An alternative blueprint for reform drafted by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko was reportedly not included in the agenda.) Despite the ongoing uncertainty, however, Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin described the Kazan summit as one of the most productive ever, according to ""The Moscow Times"" on 29 August. That comment may, however, prove to be premature in light of two related developments. First, in line with its predilection for structuring its foreign policy exclusively on bilateral, rather than multilateral ties and agreements, Turkmenistan has finally admitted its total lack of interest in the CIS and formally requested that its status be downgraded to that of associate member. (Article 8 of the CIS Statutes adopted in January 1993 provides for states with such associate membership to participate in selected CIS activities with the formal consent of the CIS full members). Some might argue that the effective exclusion of Turkmenistan from the CIS equation is a positive development insofar as it removes an obstacle to closer and more effective economic integration. Others, however, might see it as the thin end of a much larger wedge -- a wedge that the unequivocally Western-oriented CIS members, in the first instance Georgia and Ukraine, might seek to use at some future point to deal the coup de grace by announcing their collective withdrawal.One unfortunate incident at the summit's opening ceremony on 26 August -- shown on Russian television -- perfectly symbolized the CIS's dilemma. The presidents gathered in a magnificent new conference center only to find the air conditioning did not function and the windows would not open. Putin, perspiring visibly, looked on as a workman wielding a crowbar was summoned to force open a window and let in some fresh air -- a commodity without which the CIS will suffocate, sooner or later. The question being, which president will wield the crowbar?",,,

Days later, the two countries' presidents, Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, will meet in Kazan on the sidelines of a CIS summit to address the same issue. But although international mediators from the OSCE Minsk Group expressed cautious optimism after visiting Baku, Stepanakert, and Yerevan in early July, they and senior officials in Baku have warned in recent days that there is little chance the two presidents will sign a major peace accord in Kazan. The Kazan talks will be the second between the two presidents in the span of four months. The first took place in Warsaw in mid-May on the sidelines of a Council of Europe summit and, according to an Armenian Foreign Ministry statement released several days later, that meeting constituted ""yet another step forward in the resolution of the Karabakh conflict,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. The statement added that the Warsaw meeting ""makes it possible to continue the discussions"" between the two countries' foreign ministers that began one year earlier. On 17 May, the French, Russian, and U.S. co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group that is mediating the search for a solution to the Karabakh conflict released a statement similarly noting that the two presidents ""confirmed their strong interest in reaching a peaceful, negotiated solution of the conflict.""Growing ExpectationsIn early July, Armenian officials told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Armenia and Azerbaijan had reached agreement on the key points of a formal peace accord ending the Karabakh conflict, and that agreement could be signed by the end of this year. Days later, the Minsk Group co-chairmen likewise expressed cautious optimism. U.S. co-Chairman Steven Mann told journalists in Yerevan on 14 July that ""there is a possibility of a Karabakh settlement in the course of this year,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Mann repeated that prognosis the following day but qualified it, saying, ""There are very difficult issues that are still on the table and real gaps between the two sides."" Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov, who is President Aliyev's special envoy for the Karabakh conflict, was even more upbeat, telling journalists in Baku on 18 July that ""we are closer to peace than ever before,"" according to the website day.az.Citing the need for confidentiality, the Minsk Group co-chairmen have consistently declined to divulge any details of specific issues under discussion. But both Azerbaijani and Armenian officials have gone public in recent months, identifying aspects of the hypothetical peace agreement. In mid-May, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov claimed that Yerevan had agreed to, and the two sides were already discussing the time frame for, the withdrawal of Armenian forces from seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR). The Armenian Foreign Ministry rejected Mammadyarov's claim the following day.The timing of the Kazan summit -- two months before the 6 November parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan -- in itself makes it unlikely that the two presidents would sign a formal peace deal that would require a major concession from Baku, because any such concession could alienate many voters. But Russian Minsk Group co-Chairman Yurii Merzlyakov was quoted on 17 August by day.az as suggesting that the two presidents might issue a joint statement hinting that a formal peace deal is imminent.Three weeks later, on 7 June, Mammadyarov told journalists in Baku that the two sides were discussing between seven and nine issues related to a peace settlement, and that those issues have to be addressed in a specific order, with each made secure before the following is added, ""like pearls knotted on a silk thread."" Mammadyarov said Azerbaijan insists on the liberation of the seven districts currently occupied by Armenian forces, and that the two sides are discussing which countries or organizations could provide peacekeeping forces to be deployed on those territories after their liberation, according to day.az. He also said that ""after the frontiers are opened we must revive trade links and transport."" Echo-az.com quoted Mammadyarov as saying that the two sides are discussing both the ""phased"" and the ""package"" approaches to resolving the conflict. But a senior Armenian Foreign Ministry official told this writer on 8 June on condition of anonymity that the final agreement will be a package one, although its various provisions might be implemented one after the other, rather than simultaneously.Then in early July, a senior Armenian official told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that under the anticipated peace deal, Armenia would return to Azerbaijani control five of the seven districts adjacent to Karabakh currently controlled by Karabakh Armenian forces, excluding the strategic Lachin corridor. A peacekeeping force comprising troops from countries that are not members of the OSCE Minsk Group would be deployed in the conflict zone. Then, after 10-15 years, the population of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would be required to vote in a referendum on whether the region should become independent, become a part of Armenia, or revert to Azerbaijan. That blueprint is very similar to one proposed in December by former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio and NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Pierre Lellouche. But both Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Azimov and NKR Foreign Minister Arman Melikian promptly denied that the two sides were discussing a possible referendum. Azimov made the point that the constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic does not make provision for a referendum to be held only on selected parts of Azerbaijan's territory, or on issues related to the country's territorial integrity.Pulling Back?Since the beginning of August -- when Mammadyarov visited Washington -- the upbeat statements by both the Minsk Group co-chairs and officials from the Armenian and Azerbaijani Foreign Ministries have given way to more guarded pronouncements. Commenting on 6 August on Mammadyarov's visit, U.S. Minsk Group co-Chairman Mann said the Karabakh conflict was one of the issues Mammadyarov discussed with his U.S. counterpart Condoleezza Rice, day.az reported. Mann added that despite ""certain progress"" in the peace talks, the degree of consensus reached to date is not sufficient to sign a peace treaty. In an interview published on 17 August in the online daily zerkalo.az, Mann similarly said that ""it is still early to speak of a specific document. It would be a mistake to affirm that we shall sign some document right now."" At the same time, he stressed repeatedly that the two sides ""have achieved a great deal over the past 18 months,"" and he predicted that the upcoming Kazan meeting between Kocharian and Aliyev ""will give an additional impulse to the talks.""Also on 17 August, Mammadyarov echoed Mann almost word-for word, telling day.az that ""the negotiations have not yet reached the level of signing a document."" Echoing his comments of 7 June, he said that between seven and nine issues would be on the agenda at his 24 August meeting with Oskanian, and ""we shall try to reach agreement on certain elements and inform the presidents, so that they can discuss them in Kazan.""The timing of the Kazan summit -- two months before the 6 November parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan -- in itself makes it unlikely that the two presidents would sign a formal peace deal that would require a major concession from Baku, because any such concession could alienate many voters. But Russian Minsk Group co-Chairman Yurii Merzlyakov was quoted on 17 August by day.az as suggesting that the two presidents might issue a joint statement hinting that a formal peace deal is imminent. A 17 August EurasiaNet analysis similarly quoted an unnamed Azerbaijani official as saying that the most that can be hoped for from the Kazan meeting is ""a statement by the presidents in which they would order their foreign ministers to start working on the text of a future agreement."" Such a joint statement would serve to send the message to Azerbaijan's electorate that peace is finally within reach -- provided its elects a parliament in which Aliyev's Yeni Azerbaycan Party has a comfortable majority.See also:""Armenia/Azerbaijan: Mediator Sees No Organized Settlement Policy In Occupied Lands""""Azerbaijan: Baku Implicates Armenian Intelligence In Alleged Coup Bid""",,,

And then there is the axis where all of these arts merge into a harmonious union -- opera. In Armenia, opera appears to undergoing a kind of rebirth. ""Anush,"" composer Armen Tigranian's opera based on the poem of the same name by the legendary writer Hovhannes Toumanian, recently returned to the stage, with performances at the National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet in Yerevan. Before the curtain rose and the flow of music, dance and voices joined the flow of our souls, I went to the ballerinas' dressing room to talk about opera and ballet. Which operas do our ballet dancers wish could be staged as part of our opera scene?""I wish modern dance was part of the Armenian arts scene,"" one ballerina says. ""We have very, very little of it; almost none at all. We'd like very much to see 'Spartak' staged, or for the ballet 'Antuni' to be restored. I'd love to dance 'Saint Ripsime and Trdat' again."" The absence of male dancers is the main reason that composer Aram Khachaturyan's ""Spartak"" has not been part of the Armenian culture scene for many years. Armenia's male dancers are conquering stages abroad. ""I'd say our mind is more romantic; our thoughts develop in a more idealistic, ethereal manner. We are prone to idealism. Besides, we prefer classical music. But that doesn't mean that we only listen to Bach, Rakhmaninov, or Beethoven. We also go to the disco.""""Our Armenian boys are really great. We're proud of them,"" another ballerina says. ""But they don't dance here; they're spread out all over the world and keep winning the amazement and admiration of the world audience. First of all, here our young men have to serve in the army, and it's impossible for a ballet dancer to return to ballet and dance after having spent two years in military boots."" Asked to name their ballet idols, the ballerinas say Maya Plisetskaya and Ekaterina Maksimova. And what about the roles they hope to dance?""I dream of dancing 'Carmen.' Then perhaps 'Kitri,'"" one says.""I'd like to dance all the leading roles, in 'Carmen' and 'Giselle' and 'Chopeniana' and 'Gayane,' and in other ballets,"" says another.What is day-to-day life like for these young ballerinas? What makes them different from other Armenian girls?""We devote most of our time to dancing, and very little time is left for an outside life,"" one says. ""We always try hard to keep fit, to not gain weight."" ""I'd say our mind-set, our way of thinking is quite different,"" another adds. ""We have a different approach to any issue. I'd say our mind is more romantic; our thoughts develop in a more idealistic, ethereal manner. We are prone to idealism. Besides, we prefer classical music. But that doesn't mean that we only listen to Bach, Rakhmaninov, or Beethoven. We also go to the disco."" And what about their private life? ""Not every man can have a relationship with a ballerina -- marrying her and starting a family,"" says one of the ballerinas. ""There are guys who, after marriage, simply don't put up with their wife ballet dancing. But this applies to narrow-minded, limited guys. If a person were spiritually rich, he'd never prevent his wife from engaging in this kind of art. On the contrary, he'd be extremely happy that his wife performs such a beautiful, wonderful, and dazzling art.""""Of course, my boyfriend understands me and makes some concessions,"" another adds.""My boyfriend will never stop me from ballet dancing, because he is receptive to my art,"" says a third. ""He really loves and appreciates me and my art; he knows that I simply can't live without it. And using this occasion, I want to say that I love him."" Some Armenian men don't allow their girlfriend or wife to continue ballet dancing. But even under these circumstances, most girls prefer a family to a career in dance.""If I had to choose between a family and ballet, I would opt for the family,"" one says. ""Happiness in my private life is more important for me. What is essential for me is to have a beloved husband and good children, and to always be by their side."" ""I'd rather not face the question,"" another says. It was interesting to hear about the subtlety and sensitivity of the ballerinas from the point of view of their teacher. ""It's a great pleasure for me to work with ballerinas because I'm very fond of this art,"" she says. ""The girls are really nice, very caring and perceptive. They are endowed with all the good traits. Most certainly, they differ from the other girls as far as their intellect is concerned. And not only that, they differ in many things. They have a subtle sensitivity to all the psychological experiences a human being can have."" The girls noted that nowadays, the opera audience has substantially increased, especially among young people. ""We are very happy about the fact that interest in the opera and ballet, especially among young people, has grown considerably recently,"" one of them says. Another adds, ""I'd like to add that the opera hall is always sold out."" One of the dancers suggests that young people now consider the opera more fashionable and modern than, for instance, going to clubs. There are plans to restore the ballet ""Antuni,"" as well as to form a new program with a variety, including modern dance, in the near future. It really seems impossible to resist the gravitational pull of this magnetic art form once you have penetrated it.

Ruslan Basirli, the leader of the opposition youth movement Yeni Fikir, which is believed to have links to the Popular Front, was arrested last week and charged with allegedly accepting Armenian money to finance a revolution in Azerbaijan.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1060559.html,Azerbaijan Spy Scandal Continues To Raise Questions ,"August 10, 2005 10:46 GMT",,,"(RFE/RL) The Azerbaijani authorities and supporters and associates of Ruslan Bashirli, leader of the opposition youth movement Yeni Fikir, have offered widely diverging accounts of, and explanations for, the events that culminated in Bashirli's arrest last week on charges of plotting to overthrow the Azerbaijani leadership. According to a statement released on 4 August by the Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General's Office, Bashirli traveled in late July to Tbilisi at the behest of his mentor, Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (AHCP) Chairman Ali Kerimli. On the sidelines of a conference, Bashirli is said to have met with three men, one ethnic Georgian and two Armenians, all of them Armenian intelligence agents, and told them he was working on instructions from the U.S. National Democratic Institute to prepare for a revolution in Azerbaijan. His interlocutors reportedly expressed approval, promised help, and presented him with an initial payment of $2,000 to help fund the revolution, promising to provide a further $20,000 within days. One of the Armenians then informed Bashirli that the encounter had been filmed, including his acceptance of and signing a receipt for the $2,000. The Armenian reportedly told Bashirli that if he reneged on his promise to cooperate, the incriminating film footage would be handed over to the Azerbaijani authorities. Bashirli was accompanied to Tbilisi by his deputy, Osman Alimuradov, who, according to day.az on 4 August, was reluctant to collaborate with the Armenians and who denounced Bashirli to the authorities on his return to Baku. Bashirli was duly apprehended on 3 August. In an interview with Azerbaijan's Lider TV on 6 August, a transcript of which was posted on day.az on 8 August, Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General Zakir Garalov quoted from what he said was a written statement by Alimuradov. Alimuradov said he spent the night after the meeting with the three Armenian agents brooding over the implications of the course of action Bashirli had agreed to, and came to the conclusion that it was morally wrong. He said he tried to persuade Bashirli after their return to Baku to abandon the entire undertaking, but Bashirli said they should wait to do so until he received the additional $20,000. Therefore, according to Alimuradov, he decided to hand over to the Azerbaijani authorities the video footage of the meeting he was given by the Armenian. A Crude Fabrication? Bashirli's fellow oppositionists, however, have dismissed the prosecutor-general's account as a crude and clumsy fabrication intended to discredit the AHCP in the run-up to the 6 November parliamentary election, and Kerimli personally. Bashirli himself reportedly told his attorney, Elchin Garalov, on 8 August that he was being pressured to incriminate Kerimli, whom the website day.az on 6 August identified as one of Azerbaijan's most popular and respected opposition politicians. The online daily echo-az.com on 6 August quoted pro-government political scientist Mubariz Akhmedoglu as saying Bashirli is clearly guilty of treason, and the links between him and the AHCP are adequate grounds for revoking that party's official registration. Speaking at a press conference in Baku on 5 August, two deputy chairmen of Yeni Fikir, Said Nuriev and Fikret Faramazoglu, said that Bashirli was offered the $2,000 by representatives of Georgian and Armenian ""democratic forces."" They said he was drunk at the time, and hypothesized that his drink may have been spiked. They said that the following day, Bashirli returned the money. Both the official charges against Bashirli and the opposition objections to those charges are based on the incriminating video materials, which show Bashirli sipping cognac in the company of three men and uttering incriminating statements. Specifically, he is said to have agreed to the proposal made by one of the Armenian agents to take advantage of the tense domestic political situation in Azerbaijan, and even open fire at an opposition demonstration. Questions About Video But Bashirli's lawyer Gambarov told journalists in Baku on 8 August that the video footage was edited, and that Bashirli's words were ""taken out of context,"" zerkalo.az reported on 9 August. Moreover, as several Azerbaijani commentaries have pointed out, Bashirli's drunken pronouncements cannot be conflated with a statement of intent to overthrow the present leadership. Even more problematic than the content of the videocassette is the way the Azerbaijani authorities allegedly acquired it. As Bashirli's lawyer Gambarov observed on 8 August, ""No intelligence service in the world would hand over a videocassette with compromising footage to someone whom it was seeking to co-opt."" In an article entitled ""Armenian recruitment or planned operation?"" the independent online daily zerkalo.az on 6 August similarly asked why the Armenians should have given the cassette to Alimuradov. Are the Armenian special services really so stupid, the daily asked, that they would play into the hands of their Azerbaijani counterparts? The daily further noted that the Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General's Office acted unprofessionally in immediately making public the contents of the cassette, rather than handing it to the National Security Ministry to permit it to try to identify, and obtain more watertight evidence against, the purported Armenian agents. Zerkalo.az went to far as to suggest that the case against Bashirli was fabricated by the Azerbaijani authorities. But Akhmedoglu dismissed that possibility, telling day.az on 6 August that ""I do not think that the Azerbaijani authorities are powerful enough to try to manipulate the Armenian special services or certain Georgian circles."" What Lies Beneath Pending the emergence of new evidence, it is impossible at this juncture to determine with any certainty which of the above hypotheses is correct. But if, as Bashirli's supporters claim, the case against him was fabricated in Baku, then the question arises: by whom, and to what end? Was it simply a bid to discredit Kerimli and his party in the run-up to the 6 November ballot, or even to trigger widespread unrest that could be adduced for postponing that ballot? Or could the real object of the exercise be totally different? Given the rumored existence of rival factions within the upper echelons of the Azerbaijani leadership, was the hapless Bashirli simply a pawn in a larger scheme either to embarrass President Ilham Aliyev and call into question his professed commitment to building a democratic society, or to reignite popular hostility towards Armenia at a point when Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mediators have expressed cautious optimism that a negotiated settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict may be closer than ever before?

Those allegations, which the Armenian National Security Service and Bashirli's fellow Azerbaijani oppositionists have both rejected, highlight Azerbaijan's ongoing suspicion and hostility toward Armenia and call into question Baku's commitment to creating a ""level playing field"" for all parties wishing to participate in the 6 November parliamentary election. Bashirli was arrested on 3 August and charged with plotting to overthrow the Azerbaijani leadership at the instigation of Armenian intelligence agents with whom he allegedly met in Tbilisi on 28-29 July. Bashirli allegedly accepted $2,000 from one of the Armenians who promised to provide him within days with a further $20,000. A second Yeni Fikir member, Osman Alimuradov, who accompanied Bashirli to Tbilisi, said he rejected pressure to co-opt him and subsequently denounced Bashirli to the Azerbaijani authorities, Turan and day.az reported. Bashirli is said to have told the Armenians that he has received explicit instructions from the U.S. National Democracy Institute to prepare for a ""revolution"" in Azerbaijan. But two deputy chairmen of Yeni Fikir, Said Nuriev and Fikret Faramazoglu, gave a different account of Bashirli's encounter in Tbilisi at a press conference in Baku on 5 August, day.az reported. Nuriev said that Bashirli was offered the $2,000 by representatives of Georgian and Armenian ""democratic forces."" They said he was drunk at the time, and hypothesized that his drink may have been spiked. They said that Bashirli returned the money the following day. Legal expert Tofig Guliev told the same 5 August press conference that none of Bashirli's actions were unlawful and that there was no talk of seizing power in Azerbaijan. Bashirli's current whereabouts are not known. This is by no means the first time that the Azerbaijani authorities have accused Armenian intelligence services of co-opting Azerbaijani citizens to commit criminal, or even terrorist acts. In April 1996, Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry claimed that Armenian intelligence recruited and trained Armenian members of the Daghestan-based Lezgin separatist organization Sadval who subsequently perpetrated a bomb attack on the Baku metro in March 1994 that killed 14 people. Azerbaijani opposition politicians fear that Bashirli's arrest may be part of a campaign to discredit opposition in the run-up to the 6 November parliamentary election. In late July, Deputy Interior Minister Vilayat Eyubov alleged that the opposition has at its disposal an armed formation that is preparing a coup d'etat. Ali Kerimli, chairman of the progressive wing of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (AXCP), which is one of three prominent opposition parties aligned in the Azadlyg (Liberty) election bloc, denied that allegation, Turan reported on 25 July. And on 4 August, Kerimli told Turan that the charges of plotting a coup brought against Bashirli are slanderous and ""a routine attempt to discredit"" Yeni Fikir. Kerimli explained that there is no connection between Yeni Fikir and the AXCP, and that the activities of the former are directed exclusively towards ensuring that the parliamentary ballot is free and fair. The AXCP released a statement late on 4 August demanding Bashirli's immediate release and appealing to the international community to intervene on his behalf, day.az reported. Armenia's National Security Service issued a statement on 5 August dismissing as ""ridiculous"" allegations by the Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General's Office that it recruited Bashirli to spearhead a revolution in Azerbaijan, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. The statement questioned the professional qualifications of recently appointed Azerbaijani National Security Minister Eldar Mahmudov and likened the accusations against Bashirli to the trumped-up charges of espionage brought against potential rivals by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in the 1920s and 1930s.",,,

The investigation had been suspended since March 1994. A statement released today by Azerbaijan's military prosecutor says nearly 350 residents of Xocali, a predominantly Azerbaijani town of Karabakh, were killed in February 1992 soon after the poorly defended area fell into Armenian hands.Earlier official figures released in Baku had put the number of civilians killed in Xocali at nearly 500.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1060271.html,Azerbaijan YeS vs Yesterdays Men ,"July 29, 2005 09:48 GMT",,,"An antigovernment demonstration in mid-June As in 2000 and 2003, Azerbaijan's various opposition forces appear reluctant, if not unable, to close ranks in a single bloc to participate in the 6 November parliamentary elections. Both the ""traditional"" opposition parties and the more recent ""liberal"" forces have made their insistence that the election process and vote be free and fair a key tenet of their respective election platforms. In the run-up to the 1998 Azerbaijani presidential election, five of the country's most respected opposition leaders demonstrated their anger at the authorities' refusal to create equal conditions for all candidates by collectively refusing to compete. But in two subsequent national elections (parliamentary in 2000 and presidential in 2003), the opposition proved unable to align in a single bloc, or behind a single candidate. And observers are predicting that up to 20 candidates might register to contest each of the 125 seats in the new parliament to be elected on 6 November.The formal process of registering parties and blocs, and the individual candidates they will field, is still under way and ends only on 7 September. But it already seems probable that the number of blocs and parties will exceed that registered in 2000, when then President Heidar Aliyev intervened just weeks before the ballot to overturn the initial refusal by the Central Election Commission (MSK) to register eight of the 13 parties that hoped to participate (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 13 October 2000). To date, the MSK has registered five blocs, according to its website (http://www.cec.gov.az) and day.az on 28 July. They are the pro-government Islahat; the Azadlyg and Yeni Siyaset (aka YeS) opposition blocs; Democratic Azerbaijan; For the Sake of Azerbaijan; and the Alliance for the Flourishing of Azerbaijan, comprising the eponymous party and the Rebirth party. The MSK rejected on 24 July the initial registration application submitted by the bloc Pro-Azerbaijani Forces due to a minor infringement, echo-az.com reported on 26 July. Further opposition blocs seeking registration are Public Leaders; Alliance in the Name of Azerbaijan; Building a Civic Society; National Unity; and the Union for Democratic Reforms.Demands for free and fair elections have figured prominently at all opposition demonstrations so far this summer and have largely overshadowed other issues such as approaches to democratization, economic and social policy, Azerbaijan's foreign policy orientation, and how to resolve the Karabakh conflict.Several opposition parties and blocs have affirmed their hypothetical readiness to expand to include new members and/or have concluded agreements among themselves to coordinate the nomination of candidates to ensure they do not end up competing against each other in individual constituencies. For example, Liberal Party leader Avez Temirkhan dropped his plans to contest one Baku constituency in favor of Eldar Namazov of YeS, day.az reported on 27 July. But on the other hand, Azadlyg rejected the overtures of Umid party Chairman Igbal Agazade, for reasons that the latter declined to disclose, according to day.az on 8 July. Two former leading members of one party have registered from the same constituency: Etibar Mamedov, former chairman of the Azerbaijan National Independence Party and now a member of YeS, and his former Deputy Chairman Nazim Imanov will compete against each other in Baku's Yasamal Raion, day.az and echo-az.com reported on 11 and 13 July, respectively. And YeS plans to register former President Ayaz Mutalibov to contest Constituency No. 17 in Baku, where National Unity leader Lala-Shovket Gadjieva, who quit YeS due to a disagreement over election tactics, also plans to register, according to day.az on 23 July. (Those plans may fall flat, however, if the Azerbaijani authorities refuse to permit Mutalibov to return to Baku from his 13-year exile in Moscow.)A further factor that militates against greater cooperation and coordination among opposition forces, according to Namazov, is widespread mutual suspicion. The Azerbaijani media have for months, if not years, engaged in unsubstantiated rumors and speculation about possible clandestine deals being cut between opposition forces and ""oligarchs"" from within the ruling elite. Such speculation means, Namazov told day.az on 28 June, that ""there is no clear-cut mechanism for determining whether you are dealing with a real oppositionist or a politician who is playing at being part of the opposition.""The anticipated fierce competition between rival parties and blocs is all the more difficult to explain in light of the absence of any fundamental policy differences among the opposition parties. True, the opposition can be broadly divided, as the independent daily zerkalo.az noted on 28 June, into the ""traditional"" opposition parties (of which the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party [AHCP], Musavat, the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan, and the Azerbaijan National Independence Party are the most prominent) and the new ""liberal"" parties and blocs, including YeS and the Party of Democratic Reforms recently founded by Assim Mollazade, a former leading AHCP member. Some observers consider the ""traditional"" opposition, especially the three parties aligned in Azadlyg, discredited as a result of the humiliating defeat of their candidate, Musavat Party Chairman Isa Qambar, in the 2003 presidential ballot, and the ""liberals"" apparently hope to capitalize on that perception.But even so, as in 2000 and 2003, the overriding issue is the demand by all opposition parties that this time around the ballot be free, fair, democratic, and transparent, and the authorities should not be permitted to retain power by resorting to what Gerard Stoudmann, then director of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, referred to in the wake of the November 2000 parliamentary ballot as ""a crash course in manipulation"" of the outcome. Demands for free and fair elections have figured prominently at all opposition demonstrations so far this summer and have largely overshadowed other issues such as approaches to democratization, economic and social policy, Azerbaijan's foreign policy orientation, and how to resolve the Karabakh conflict. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky touched on that ideological vacuum during a speech in Baku on 27 July, stressing that ""all political parties carry responsibility to participate fully in the election process through nonviolent campaigns that explain issue-specific messages and platforms to voters. The people of Azerbaijan must have real choices,"" Turan reported.Related Story:Is Washington Able To Help Opposition In Uzbekistan And Azerbaijan?",,,

It also acts as an instrument of conflict prevention, crisis management, and postconflict rehabilitation. But its member states must do the hard work of actually implementing reforms. And according to the annual report of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, a lot more remains to be done to firmly establish democracy in many parts of the OSCE region. (For a country-by-country fact sheet, see below.) Prague, 27 June 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The 500-page report by the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation (IHF) covers human rights developments in 38 member states of the OSCE in 2004.Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the IHF, told RFE/RL: ""It's difficult to make a generalization about human rights in such a group of countries, some of which are the most democratic and liberal countries in the world and some others are extremely repressive. But what you can say is that, in some areas especially, not much progress is being made in human rights.""The 38 countries reviewed in the IHF report are located in Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and North America. Twenty-four are former socialist states, while 13 are established Western democracies. Turkey is also included.According to the IHF, judicial systems fell short of international standards in more than 60 percent of the 38 countries reviewed. Corruption, the lack of judicial independence, and the poor training of judicial professionals were of particular concern. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan were singled out as needing further improvement.Rhodes says reports of police brutality or other police misconduct were received from 80 percent of the countries under scrutiny. ""We found that in 80 percent of the countries that we scrutinized in this report, there are serious problems as regards police brutality,"" he said. ""And in 10 of them, some of the practices constituted torture. In a majority of countries that are covered in the report, there are problems in prisons, especially overcrowding.""The document says 60 percent of the countries reviewed violated the right to asylum or other rights of refugees and migrants. According to the report, antiterrorism measures also curtailed many basic rights throughout the region, including in Britain, the Russian republic of Chechnya, the United States, and Uzbekistan.Rhodes says the IHF's report should not be construed as a criticism of the OSCE, but is rather meant to highlight how well the group's members are adhering to their human rights commitments.""The OSCE is a framework in which participating states can work together to raise the level of compliance with the human rights commitments that are undertaken in the OSCE process,"" Rhodes said. ""Some states honor their commitments, and some states ignore their commitments. Of course, you can't blame the OSCE as such for the failure of its members to approach their obligations in the OSCE in an honorable way.""Urdur Gunnarsdottir, a spokeswoman for the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw, agrees. ""Many of the concerns that the International Helsinki Federation raises are the same concerns that have been raised many times by the OSCE,"" she said. ""Those regard issues such as the situation of free and fair elections, human rights, the fight against intolerance, etc., etc.. This is, of course, the responsibility of participating states. The OSCE, as an organization, is not going to change everything.""The IHF describes itself as a self-governing group of nongovernmental, not-for-profit organizations that act to protect human rights throughout the Caucasus, Central Asia, Europe, and North America.--------------------------------------------COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY FACT SHEETThe following are excerpts from the IHF's report on the OSCE region pertaining to countries in RFE/RL's broadcast region, as well as the United States.ARMENIAThe Armenian government failed to take effective measures in 2004 to address several serious prevailing human rights problems.Armenia's opposition activists faced harassment, prosecution on questionable grounds, and were beaten up by the police or by ""unidentified individuals."" A new law adopted in April 2004 enhanced the rights of public authorities to restrict public gatherings.The authorities also took indirect measures to silence critical media outlets, including the use of financial pressure, as well as unnecessary sanitary and fire inspections. AZERBAIJANAzerbaijan's opposition remained inactive in 2004 following the previous year's flawed elections in which Ilham Aliyev was elected president. Postelection protests were quashed through massive government repression.Courts demonstrated dependence on the executive branch, especially in politically sensitive cases such as those regarding arrests for participation in the demonstrations.Prison conditions remained harsh, with numerous allegations of torture and ill treatment made by prisoners whose arrests were most likely politically motivated. BELARUSPresident Alyaksandr Lukashenka kept Belarus in a tight, authoritarian grip in 2004. Both the October parliamentary elections and referendum to decide Lukashenka's eligibility in the forthcoming presidential elections fell seriously short of international standards.The government imposed excessive restrictions on the freedom of expression, association, and the media, while violations of the right to peaceful assembly continued. Fair trial standards were repeatedly violated by the courts. Police misconduct continued, including arbitrary arrests and ill treatment of detainees. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINABosnia and Herzegovina's October local elections were held in accordance with international standards of free and fair elections. However, the country trailed behind its neighboring countries in many respects.The institutional protection of human rights was in stagnation as no adequate replacement was found for the Human Rights Chamber. The body was abolished in late 2003, leaving individuals without appropriate and efficient recourse to the courts.GEORGIAOne year after the Rose Revolution, the country led by President Mikheil Saakashvili could be characterized as having an extremely strong central government and sweeping presidential powers, with no functioning system of checks and balances. In 2004, Georgia had virtually no parliamentary opposition, a judicial system that was not yet sufficiently independent and functioning, and a self-censoring media. Observers expressed concern that many of the measures aimed at reforms were adopted in a rush, were ill conceived, and not in line with European standards to which Georgia has committed itself.KAZAKHSTAN A lack of pluralism continued to characterize Kazakhstan's political arena in 2004. The opposition won only one seat in the fall parliamentary elections, which remained unoccupied. In a further serious blow to the opposition, the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement was liquidated.Meanwhile, media ownership remained highly concentrated in the hands of companies close to President Nursultan Nazarbaev. The threat of libel and defamation charges also encouraged widespread self-censorship among media outlets. The situation regarding freedom of religion deteriorated toward the end of the year, with reports of new cases of harassment against unregistered religious communities. The authorities further stepped up efforts to control the practice of Islam. KYRGYZSTANSerious human rights violations continued in Kyrgyzstan in 2004, with human rights activists, journalists, and independent media outlets facing intimidation and harassment.Serious irregularities took place in the elections to local councils in October, as well as in the parliamentary elections in early 2005. Those irregularities led to an uprising that forced President Askar Akaev to flee the country.The judiciary was dependent both on the Akaev administration and local governments. Judges were vulnerable to bribes, and lawyers were hindered from working freely.Prisons remained seriously substandard and suffered from overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions.MACEDONIAThree years after the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, hailed as the peaceful solution to Macedonia's 2001 armed conflict, a large number of the envisaged legal and practical changes were made in the country. However, some of these changes did not result in general improvements in the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms. Both the laws regulating the principle of nondiscrimination and their implementation were inadequate. Many new legal regulations contradicted other legislation, including the constitution, and resulted in political arbitrariness in their interpretation and application. MOLDOVA/TRANSDNIESTERWidespread human rights violations continued across Moldova in 2004. Freedom of the media deteriorated, principally due to a government firing of employees at the public broadcaster Teleradio Moldova. Unofficial censorship and pressure on the media remained widespread. Moldovan law-enforcement agents continued to use torture and ill-treatment as a common investigation method to extract ""confessions,"" which were then used as evidence in court.There was pressure from the authorities on the courts, and widespread corruption among judges remained a serious problem. Religious minority groups faced harassment. No Muslim groups had been registered by the end of 2004.In Transdniester, the already alarming human rights situation deteriorated further. Authorities continued attacks against human rights defenders, while policies toward the Moldovan/Romanian minority were hardened. ROMANIAThe IHF says 2004 was characterized by a deterioration in the status of civil rights and liberties in Romania. The Social Democratic Party (PSD), which ruled the country until December 2004, largely succeeded in controlling nearly all sectors of the country's political, economic, social, and cultural lives. Many crucial questions regarding the judicial system remained unsolved, showing a lack of genuine will to make the judiciary truly independent. Accountability of law-enforcement officers for misconduct has not improved. New cases of ill-treatment were reported, including unlawful use of firearms, which in some cases led to deaths. Religious minority groups faced harassment, and the representation of national or ethnic minorities in political life was restricted by new legal provisions. RUSSIAN FEDERATIONAll sides in Chechnya's conflict committed serious abuses against civilians, including ""disappearances,"" torture, and extrajudicial killings. Such abuses were increasingly perpetrated by armed formations operating under officials loyal to Moscow. In the name of fighting terrorism, Moscow also engaged in efforts to further centralize power, restrict democratic and civil liberties, and establish bureaucratic control over civil society. Human rights defenders and independent journalists were harassed, in particular those who were critical of official antiterrorism policies. Due process violations remained rampant within the court system, and law-enforcement authorities continued to engage in the use of force with a high degree of impunity. SERBIA AND MONTENEGROIn 2004, the high hopes of Serbia's potential to move toward transition were dashed.Former President Slobodan Milosevic's legacy turned out to be a serious obstacle, penetrating society's basic values. Anachronistic nationalism continued to influence national interests. The cabinet failed to offer a vision or resolutions to problems such as the status of Kosovo, the state union of Serbia and Montenegro, or a new constitution, while reaffirming its commitment to association with the European Union. Furthermore, despite numerous indications of its entropy, the army continued to be regarded as an untouchable institution.TAJIKISTANPresident Imomali Rakhmonov continued his authoritarian rule in 2004. A number of opposition leaders faced allegedly politically motivated charges, ahead of the February 2005 parliamentary elections. Independent media faced various obstacles, including self-censorship due to the threat of defamation charges. Cases of intimidation and violence targeting journalists who were critical of the authorities were also reported. The government continued to restrict independent religious activities. Numerous members and supporters of the banned Hizb ut-Tahrir Islamic group were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms, in trials that fell short of international due process standards. In these and other cases, torture and ill-treatment were frequently reported. TURKMENISTANPresident Saparmurat Niyazov continued to rule Turkmenistan with an iron fist in 2004. The IHF characterizes Turkmenistan as the most repressive state in the OSCE region. There were no legal opposition movements or alternative mass media in the country. Security police continued to closely monitor all organized activity and harassed members of religious minorities and nongovernmental organizations. Members of ethnic minorities were systematically discriminated against in employment and education. UKRAINEThe political developments in Ukraine were dominated in 2004 by protests that led to opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko being elected president.During the October election campaign, state media openly supported the pro-government candidate, Viktor Yanukovych. Several critical media outlets were suspended and journalists fired. Large-scale arrests and short-term detention of opposition activists were also commonplace during the campaign. UNITED STATES The IHF says the United States' reputation as an advocate of human rights and democracy continued to be seriously damaged by its own human rights record in 2004.Coercive interrogation tactics that frequently amounted to degrading treatment and even torture of detainees were common practice in places of detention outside the United States but under U.S. military control, such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, a number of practices that undermine international law and human rights standards have became prevalent in the U.S. government's ""war on terror."" They included the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects who were neither charged with a crime nor brought before a court, and the practice of transferring suspects to states known for torturing detainees. In positive developments, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional for individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their offense. UZBEKISTANAs in previous years, the Uzbek government prevented opposition parties from participating in the parliamentary elections in December 2004.Media remained under strict state control during the campaign leading up to the polls, while authorities further stepped up efforts to restrict the circulation of independent information. Human rights defenders were subjected to persecution, including detention and physical assault. In response to a series of attacks by militants in March and April, and another in late July, the authorities intensified their long-standing campaign against ""religious extremists."" This campaign has indiscriminately targeted thousands of Muslims who have not been involved in any violent activities but who have merely practiced their beliefs outside state-controlled institutions.

The leaders of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Kazakhstan joined oil executives from nearly 40 countries at the opening ceremony for the line, which bypasses Russia.Addressing world energy executives at the Sangacal oil terminal, some 40 kilometers south of Baku, the Azerbaijani, Turkish, Georgian, and Kazakh leaders spoke with one voice to underline the importance of the new transport route.Azerbaijan's main oil-export conduit will connect Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via the Georgian capital Tbilisi. It will be coupled with a natural-gas-export pipeline linking Baku, Tbilisi, and Turkey's eastern Anatolian city of Erzurum in 2006.Construction of the U.S.-sponsored Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) started in 2001, and its final cost totaled well over the $3 billion originally planned.Presidents Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia and Heidar Aliyev of Azerbaijan were the two main regional architects of the BTC.Yet neither of the two leaders attended today's ceremony. Shevardnadze was deposed by peaceful opposition-led street protests in November 2003, and Heidar Aliyev -- after whom the Azerbaijani section of the BTC was renamed -- died nearly two years ago to be succeeded by his son, Ilham.Addressing reporters in Baku yesterday, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said both the BTC and its sister gas pipeline were of utmost importance for his country -- which until now has been heavily dependent on Russia for its energy supplies.""In practical terms, [BTC] and the [Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum] gas pipeline are extremely important projects for Georgia,"" Saakashvili said. ""When the gas pipeline is launched, the issue of Georgia's energy independence will be finally solved. Georgia will no longer depend on a single source for its energy supplies. This is the most important guarantor of our energy independence.""Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in turn thanked Azerbaijan's neighbors for contributing to making the immense project a reality.""[It is the input of] regional cooperation and mutual understanding that made this seemingly unrealistic project -- the world's largest energy project, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline -- come into life,"" Aliyev said.Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said today that he is confident the new pipeline will bring stability and economic gains to the entire Southern Caucasus region. [For analysts' opinions, click here.]""The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which is the most important element of the East-West transport corridor -- also known as the Silk Road of the 21st century -- makes an important contribution in enhancing the stability and economic well-being of the entire region,"" Sezer said.The BTC stretches 1,760 kilometers, including 440 kilometers through Azerbaijan and 250 kilometers through Georgia. The pipeline is designed to carry oil extracted from Azerbaijan's sector of the Caspian Sea by a BP-led international consortium comprising 11 companies.It will take several months to fill the conduit. Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler told the Anadolu news agency today that the first barrel of oil will not reach its final destination until September.BTC will be running at full capacity only in 2009, when production reaches its peak in Azerbaijan. The pipeline will then carry an expected 1 million barrels of oil per day.Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbaev announced plans yesterday to export part of its production through BTC under a scheme that would involve the construction of an underwater pipeline linking the Kazakh city port of Aktau to Baku.Aliyev's chief of staff Ramiz Mehdiyev said today that experts are still working on a final document that should seal Kazakhstan's participation in the project.Also today, the presidents of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia signed a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to build a railway connection between the Turkish city of Kars, near the Armenian border, and Baku.The line will go through Georgia's predominantly Armenian region of Samtskhe-Javakheti, and then on to Tbilisi.",,,1
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1058990.html,World Amnestys Global Survey Condemns Governments For Human Rights Failures ,"May 25, 2005 09:59 GMT",,,"The U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, figures heavily in the Amnesty report Amnesty International says governments are failing to provide principled leadership in the quest for a world order based on respect for human rights. In its annual global survey, released today, the watchdog group says the global war against terrorism has been more effective in eroding human rights principles than in countering violence. The report singles out the United States for particularly harsh criticism. Amnesty says Washington ""thumbed its nose at the rule of law"" by not properly investigating reports of prisoner abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghurayb prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and at Bagram air base in Afghanistan. The poor human rights situations in Iran, Russia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus are also highlighted. But Amnesty says there were signs of hope in 2004, too. Prague, 25 May 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Suad is the mother of Jamil, a 27-year-old Yemeni man detained in Pakistan in January 2002 and now incarcerated at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. She contends Jamil was simply studying engineering in Pakistan and regrets how difficult his ordeal has been on his children.""The eldest one remembers her father, and in the street sometimes, she looks at people and thinks she's seen her dad,"" Suad says. ""The 4-year-old was only 1 when he left and does not remember him. And the youngest one doesn't know him. In truth, the eldest is very affected. She is very sensitive. She remembers her father.""Jamil is one of more than 500 detainees being held without charges at the U.S. naval base in Cuba on suspicion of links to Al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The detention of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo, as well as the transfer of some 100 detainees to their home countries, are singled out for criticism by Amnesty International in the annual survey.Irene Khan, Amnesty International's secretary-general, says 2004 saw governments not only failing to fulfill human rights pledges but betraying those promises in places such as Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya, and in Sudan's troubled Darfur region.The report disputes claims by the Russian government that the conflict in Chechnya is ""normalizing."" It says security forces enjoyed virtual impunity for human rights abuses, including reports that Russian soldiers tortured, raped, and sexually abused women.""Take the situation in Darfur, where the UN Security Council failed to take action despite reports of increasing abuse of human rights there,"" Khan says. ""The government of China failed to act because of its own oil interests there. The government of Russia failed to act because of its arms trade with the Sudanese government. And the United States called Darfur genocide but failed to follow it up with any effective action. Take the promise of security which governments made, but failed to provide in Iraq or Afghanistan.""Khan says Washington has instead gone to great lengths to restrict the application of the Geneva Conventions and to ""sanitize and redefine"" torture by seeking to justify coercive interrogation techniques. She says the United States -- the world's unrivaled superpower -- has failed in its role of setting human rights standards.In its report, Amnesty calls the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo the ""gulag of our times."" Brendan Paddy is a spokesman for Amnesty International.""By saying that Guantanamo Bay is the 'gulag of our times,' Amnesty International is not attempting to draw any direct comparison between the treatment or scale of the Soviet gulag system and Guantanamo Bay and other detention centers run by the U.S.,"" Paddy says. ""What we are saying is that we are gravely concerned that what's happening at Guantanamo is entrenching a practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law.""The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the Amnesty report until its release.But James Phillips, who specializes in foreign policy issues at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, says he believes the United States is setting a good example for the rest of the world. He says the detainees at Guantanamo represent a real threat.""I think [Amnesty International] underestimates the threats posed in the war of terrorism, and that the U.S. government is legally acting in keeping these people on Guantanamo,"" Phillips says. ""Some of the [prisoners] that have been released from Guantanamo have already returned to inciting and carrying out terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, so I think they are [at Guantanamo] for a good reason.""The Amnesty report covers 149 countries -- from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe.RussiaThe report disputes claims by the Russian government that the conflict in Chechnya is ""normalizing."" It says security forces enjoyed virtual impunity for human rights abuses, including reports that Russian soldiers tortured, raped, and sexually abused women.""Clearly, there have been very grave abuses committed by armed Chechen separatist groups, most notably those in Beslan, which were clearly absolutely horrific and wholly without any justification of any sort,"" Paddy says. ""But what is equally disturbing is that in Chechnya itself, we have also seen armed forces of both the Chechen government supported by Moscow and also by Russian forces themselves committing horrific abductions, rapes, and murders against Chechen civilians.""Amnesty says the human rights situation in Ingushetia also deteriorated, and that ethnic and national minorities were attacked in many Russian regions, sometimes fatally, with few convictions for racist attacks.AfghanistanAfghanistan was plagued in 2004 by lawlessness and insecurity, which hampered efforts to establish peace and stability, Amnesty says. Afghan women in particular experienced widespread discrimination and violence.""One of the particularly disturbing things about the situation in Afghanistan is -- regardless of who appears to be in control in each area -- the situation for women has not improved to any significant extent, as far as we can judge,"" Paddy says. ""We've seen numerous cases of women being subjected to what amounts to tribal justice, where the writ of Afghan law does not seem to run.""Middle EastIn Iraq, Amnesty accuses both U.S.-led military forces and armed militant groups of committing gross human rights violations. Thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed in the crossfire.In Iran, Amnesty notes, scores of political prisoners were sentenced to prison following unfair trials. Many more were arrested in 2004 on charges that articles they had written endangered national security or defamed officials or Islamic religious precepts. Central AsiaIn Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan are cited for threatening Uyghur asylum seekers and refugees with detention and expulsion to China. Conditions on death row in Kyrgyzstan are described as cruel and inhuman. And despite its own moratorium on capital punishment, Amnesty says Bishkek deported prisoners to China and Uzbekistan, where they faced execution.Uzbekistan is condemned for what Amnesty describes as its ""appalling"" human rights record in 2004.""One of the most serious concerns that Amnesty has had about Uzbekistan is the apparent reluctance in parts of the international community, particularly on the part of the United States, to directly challenge the government regarding its human rights record, which has been appalling in 2004, apparently because of the close connection between the two governments in their so-called war on terror,"" Paddy says. ""One of the consequences of this is the government of Uzbekistan may have misunderstood the latitude it had in responding to the more recent protests which have occurred in the east of the country.""Amnesty notes the arbitrary detention of hundreds of devout Muslim men and women in Uzbekistan following a series of attacks and bombings in 2004. It says scores were given unfair trials and sentenced to long prison terms. Evidence obtained through torture was routinely admitted in court.Human rights abuses were also widespread in Turkmenistan, where Amnesty says religious minorities and civil society activists faced harassment and imprisonment.In Tajikistan, reports of torture and ill treatment by police were noted. Amnesty says at least four men were executed in secret shortly before a moratorium on the death penalty took effect.TranscaucasusIn the Caucasus, police in Armenia and Georgia are criticized for the use of excessive force, while courts in Azerbaijan are singled out for reportedly using evidence extracted under torture and for sentencing at least 40 opposition activists to jail after unfair trials.Room For OptimismBut Amnesty says 2004 also witnessed progress on the human rights front. Paddy says people in Ukraine and the Middle East, for example, felt increasingly willing to challenge government failures. He also highlights legal challenges to what Amnesty calls the ""dangerous new agenda"" being pursued by many governments.""There have obviously also in 2004 been some hopeful signs that people, that the judiciary, that parts of the UN system, will not accept the betrayal of governments of the promises they have made,"" Paddy says. ""We have seen, for example, both in the U.K. and also in the U.S., the highest courts in those respective countries directly challenging the executives' removal of certain fundamental rights from particular prisoners, in Guantanamo, and in the case of the U.K., those held at Belmarsh prison under suspicion of involvement in terrorism.""Paddy also notes positive movement toward reform at the United Nations, in particular in its flawed human rights mechanisms. He says the mission of governments and international institutions must now be to reassert the primacy of human rights.""The most critical thing that governments can do -- rather than making new promises and new pronouncements about their respect for justice, the rule of law, human dignity, and human rights -- is turn that rhetoric into reality,"" Paddy says. ""Most of the law that is needed to protect people from these grave violations and to lay the bedrock of respect for the rule of law, which must be the basis on which you can build any just, stable, secure, and peaceful society, rather than respect those, they continue to make new promises.""Amnesty says the popular movements in support of the victims of the South Asian tsunami and the Madrid train bombings prove the power of ordinary people to ""promote hope over fear.""(RFE/RL correspondent Andrew F.

But on 18 May, the Armenian Foreign Ministry released a formal rebuttal of Mammadyarov's statement.The seven districts in question have been under the control of Armenian forces for the past 12 years, and many observers consider them Yerevan's sole ""ace,"" to be traded for a major concession by Baku on the NKR's final future status under any eventual peace agreement (the so-called ""land for status"" model of conflict resolution).Mammadyarov's statement may have been intended to derail the Karabakh peace talks temporarily by putting the Armenian side on the defensive.Mammadyarov said on 17 May that talks are already under way on the timeframe for an Armenian withdrawal from the seven occupied districts. He added, however, that this would be a lengthy process, in light of the need to address related problems such as mine-clearing, postconflict rehabilitation of the districts in question, and the return to their abandoned homes of those districts' ethnic Azerbaijani population, according today.az on 17 May.On 18 May, however, Armenian Foreign Ministry spokeman Hamlet Gasparian released a statement in Yerevan denying that Armenia has agreed to liberate the seven Azerbaijani regions. At the same time, Gasparian described as ""a further step forward"" towards resolving the Karabakh conflict the talks between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev in Warsaw on 15 May on the sidelines of the Council of Europe summit. In line with the long-standing confidentiality agreement surrounding the negotiations (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 9 July 2004), Gasparian did not divulge any details of what the two presidents discussed. But both he and the three co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group, which is mediating the peace talks, said the Warsaw meeting opens the way for a continuation of the so-called ""Prague talks"" between Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian that began one year ago. Mammadyarov and Oskanian met in Warsaw on 15 May with the Minsk Group co-chairs.Rumors of a possible Armenian withdrawal from three, five, or all seven of the occupied Azerbaijan districts have been circulating for several years. In early 2004, the European Parliament rapporteur for the South Caucasus, Per Gahrton, circulated a draft report on the South Caucasus that included a proposal that Armenia should cede five of the occupied districts in exchange for the resumption of rail traffic from Azerbaijan to Armenia. The five districts in question were Jebrayil, Fizuli, Zangelan, Agdam, and Gubadla, but not the strategic Lachin corridor that serves as the sole overland road link between the NKR and Armenia. Senior Azerbaijani officials, including Parliament Speaker Murtuz Alesqerov, were quoted as expressing support for Gahrton's proposal. Alesqerov told the European Commission's special envoy, Antonius De Vries, in Baku on 29 January that ""Azerbaijan accepts this plan. We believe the liberation of the districts can promote the restoration of the territorial integrity of the country,"" Interfax-Azerbaijan reported on 30 January 2004. But the European Parliament ultimately deleted that proposal from the draft resolution before adopting it (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 27 February 2004). Mammadyarov's deputy, Araz Azimov, told journalists in January 2005, following the most recent Prague meeting between the two foreign ministers, that an Armenian withdrawal from all seven districts was on the agenda of the Prague talks, according to zerkalo.az on 14 January. But Armenian officials, including Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian, have dismissed any talk of an exchange of the occupied districts for the resumption of rail traffic as ""unserious.""If Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev did indeed make progress at their meeting in Warsaw -- their first meeting in eight months -- it is unclear why Mammadyarov should have immediately jeopardized that progress by violating the confidentialty of the talks with a statement that Yerevan immediately rebutted as untrue. One possible explanation, suggested by Armenian majority Republican Party of Armenia parliament faction head Galust Sahakian in an interview with A1+, is that Mammadyarov's announcement was intended first and foremost for domestic consumption to create the impression that Baku has scored a major diplomatic victory at a time when the Azerbaijani leadership is under increasing pressure from the international community to amend its election legislation and take other related steps to ensure that the parliamentary elections due in November are free, fair, transparent, and democratic. Alternatively, Mammadyarov's statement may have been intended to derail the Karabakh peace talks temporarily (until after the parliamentary elections?) by putting the Armenian side on the defensive in the face of accusations from the opposition that it has sold out and compromised the future security of the NKR by ceding control of the Lachin corridor. Such a delay would obviate the need for Azerbaijani to announce publicly in the run-up to the November ballot any unpalatable concessions on Karabakh which the opposition could seek to turn to its advantage.",,,

Lyabedzka also hinted that he would be seeking a meeting with Bush himself.Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili told the crowd in Freedom Square on 10 May that the Georgian government is committed to helping the United States spread democracy worldwide, including in Belarus.But the U.S. administration's rhetoric is being heard beyond the confines of Belarus. Oppositionists within Russia are also listening. A group of Chechens living in Georgia demonstrated in Tbilisi on 10 May, calling on the United States to support Chechen independence, Caucasus Press reported. ""We hope that George Bush will use his influence with Russia and will promote a political solution of the Chechen people's problems,"" a demonstrator told the news agency. Likewise, opposition figures in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan have taken inspiration from the so-called colored revolutions, even taking to wearing orange clothing in emulation of the successful Ukrainian opposition. According to RFE/RL, an opposition group called the Tatar Public Center from another ethnic republic in Russia, Tatarstan, hoped to send protestors to Bush's speech in Tbilisi, although it eventually changed its plans.PanArmenian.net reported on 6 May that an unnamed Bush administration source had cautioned oppositionists in Armenia and Azerbaijan -- where governments have carried out elections at least as compromised as those that sparked the revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan -- not to interpret Bush's support for Georgia as a call for revolution in those countries. ""We welcome reforms in both power structures and beyond them,"" the source was quoted as saying. ""Opposition forces should be engaged in peaceful democratic processes in Armenia and Azerbaijan."" RFE/RL reported that Azerbaijani oppositionists were prevented by Georgian police from unfurling a banner during Bush's 10 May speech in Tbilisi.On 3 May, about 100 opposition demonstrators rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in the Uzbek capital Tashkent calling for Uzbek President Islam Karimov's ouster. According to ""India Daily,"" the goal of the protest was to ""attract U.S. State Department and international attention.""Reaction To Washington's WordsAt the same time, the U.S. statements have irked politicians in Russia and China, as well as the entrenched regimes in countries like Belarus. Russian analysts in recent days have been speaking more frequently about a ""coordinated campaign"" against Russia. Aleksei Zudin, director of the Political Science Department of the Center for Political Strategy, added that the recent comments ""are undoubtedly an integral part of the pressure on Russia that began with the so-called colored revolutions,"" politcom.ru reported on 6 May.The Beijing magazine ""Shijie Zhishi"" in April published an analysis entitled ""The Background Behind The Color 'Revolutions' In The CIS"" that described purported U.S.-led efforts to ""fill the political vacuum in this region."" The magazine charges that over the last decade, the United States has spent ""more than $21 billion"" through the Freedom Support Act to ""exert influence on the political- and economic-development process in these states."" The West ""is continually exerting political pressure and creating a 'relaxed' political environment for opposition political forces in these states,"" the article charges.With opposition groups encouraged by the successes of anti-establishment revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan and closely following statements from Washington that seem to be urging them to follow these examples, the danger of crackdowns -- especially in countries like Belarus and Uzbekistan -- has also been heightened. The United States could find itself in a position similar to the one that followed the first Gulf War in 1991, when Kurdish oppositionists felt encouraged to rise up against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein only to have their uprising savagely put down without substantial assistance from the West.",,,

For decades, survivors of those events and their descendants have lobbied for international recognition that ""genocide"" occurred. But successive Turkish governments have denied the kllings were aimed at exterminating the Christian Armenian population. Prague, 24 April 2005 (RFE/RL) -- It was a somber occasion as Armenians from all over the world gathered in Yerevan to commemorate the 90th anniversary of what they call ""Genocide Day."" On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities arrested some 250 Armenian community leaders in Yerevan. It was the start two of years of mass expulsions and killings of Christian Armenians by Ottoman authorities. Ceremonies in Yerevan today included the laying of a wreath at the ""genocide memorial"" by Armenian President Robert Kocharian. Memorial masses also were being celebrated at Yerevan's Saint Gregory cathedral, as well as in churches all over Armenia. Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen perished as a result of orchestrated killings as the Ottoman Empire -- the predecessor of modern Turkey -- was crumbling. Authorities in Ankara have consistently denied that version of events. Turkey says about 300,000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were killed as a result of ""civil strife"" when Armenians rose against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. In Yerevan on 23 April, more than 10,000 people marched with torches to demand that Turkey recognize the killings as genocide. Armenians say they hope their mass demonstrations will increase the pressure on Turkey. There are some signs that the effort may be working. Europe Urges Turkey Also on 23 April, the Conference of European Churches called on Turkey to recognize the genocide claim. On 22 April, French President Jacques Chirac accompanied President Kocharian to a Paris monument for victims of the massacre. And in Germany, members of parliament from across the political spectrum appealed to Turkey to accept the massacre of Armenians as part of its history, saying the move would help Ankara's EU aspirations. Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan also says recognition of genocide will help Turkey's bid for European Union membership. ""Genocide today is still a threat for the international community. That issue has been addressed by the UN and others. Secondly, there is the issue of Turkey's accession into the European Union. That's why this issue has also come to the forefront. Because if Turkey would like to join the European Union, the EU must ask. That's what they are doing now -- so that Turkey comes to terms with its past,"" Oskanyan said. Polish Nobel laureate and former president Lech Walesa has gone further. He says Armenians have the right to demand that the European Union bar Turkey from joining the bloc unless it admits to genocide. On 19 April, Poland joined a list of 15 countries that have officially acknowledged the killings as genocide when its parliament passed a resolution condemning the Armenian massacres. The Polish decision has drawn protests from Ankara. Turkish officials call the move ""irresponsible,"" and say it will hurt relations. A Moral Issue Armenian President Kocharian has been making some conciliatory gestures toward the government in Ankara. He says Yerevan will not ask for financial compensation if Turkey recognizes the killings as genocidal. Kocharian says recognition is a ""moral issue"" rather than a financial one. Many members of the Armenian diaspora worldwide converged on Yerevan to take part in today's ceremonies. Among them is Rubina Pirumyan, a Los Angeles resident of Armenian descent who took part in the demonstration marches: ""Today for me is a very special day. I've been doing this for years and years -- commemorating the memory of the genocide, of the victims of the Armenian genocide. And I am excited today because I am walking with the youth of Armenia,"" said Pirumyan. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently proposed the creation of a joint Armenian-Turkish commission to review the historical dispute. Several Turkish officials have said they think the study will confirm Turkey's arguments.",,,0

The report was officially released today in Geneva by UNICEF's executive director Carol Bellamy. Prague, 18 April 2005 (RFE/RL) -- UNICEF says in its latest report entitled ""Progress for Children "" that education for girls has been expanding all over the world. But progress has not been fast enough and some 115 million children -- mostly girls -- are still not attending primary school. Primary education for every child by 2015 is a key UN goal. However, the report warns that unless there is a big improvement the world will not reach the target. Damien Personnaz, UNICEF's spokesman in Geneva, says there are three main obstacles to education.The problem is most acute in Central and West Africa and also South Asia. Pakistan and Afghanistan have the widest gender gaps in the region.""The first [obstacle] is the lack of commitment from leaders. Everywhere that progress has been strong, it is first and foremost because leaders have committed energy, creativity and also -- much more important -- resources to get children into school. The second factor is obviously poverty. The one which is also very important is conflict, HIV/AIDS,"" says Personnaz.The problem is most acute in Central and West Africa and also South Asia. Pakistan and Afghanistan have the widest gender gaps in the region. The UNICEF spokesman says some progress has been achieved in Afghanistan but much still needs to be done to break down the barriers that keep girls out of schools. ""I think the Afghan government has taken the education issue very seriously, but in Afghanistan you have a combination of cultural factors where girls were not pushed to go to schools. And the second factor of course is the prevailing insecurity in most of the areas in Afghanistan,"" says Personnaz.The UNICEF report says most of Caucasus and Central Asian countries are on track to meet the gender parity goal -- however in many countries education budgets have been shrinking. ""Central Asia, including the Caucasus, has seen a major drop -- especially countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which has seen a drop in public spending on education. Another country is Kyrgyzstan, where public expenditure on education has dropped from 6 percent in '91 to 4.5 percent in 2002, and that's I think a major concern to all of us. Countries such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are pretty well on track,"" says Personnaz.He says governments should invest in education in order to achieve economic progress. ""It is very important to get a clear commitment from the leaders of the developing world. It is also very important to educate the mothers. We found out that 75 percent of the countries where children are not going to school have mothers who never went to school themselves. And it is also very important to put an emphasis on getting girls into schools, because when you have a poor country, boys are usually going to school but girls are requested to stay at home,"" Personnaz says.UNICEF says removing school fees is essential for achieving the goal of education for all.",,,

The Azerbaijani and Armenian foreign ministers held separate talks in London yesterday with negotiators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.In an interview with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service yesterday, Elmar Mammadyarov said he is cautiously optimistic that the talks, which are part of a round of negotiations called the ""Prague Process,"" may eventually yield results:""There is some movement in the process, which is called the Prague Process.,"" Mammadyarov said. ""We hope that the movement will [continue] steadily further and we agreed that the next meeting is going to be in Frankfurt, on the 27th of this month.""Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenians since the early 1990s, following fighting that killed an estimated 30,000 people.A cease-fire was signed in 1994, but the region's final political status has not been determined.",,,

Merzlyakov did not give details of the new peace plan, other than to warn that it will require mutual concessions from both sides. Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisian warned last week that ""painful"" concessions are unavoidable (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 31 March 2005). The London talks will also determine whether Armenian President Robert Kocharian will meet with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliev in Moscow next month on the sidelines of a Council of Europe summit in Warsaw. Two trends in recent weeks had seemed to call into question the prospects for further progress towards a peaceful solution of the Karabakh conflict. In late February, Oskanian fell ill with pneumonia, and was unable to travel to Prague for a further round of talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 2 March 2005). Oskanian had hinted at the beginning of a ""new phase"" in the conflict settlement process following his previous meeting with Mammadyarov in January (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 21 January 2005). But the Minsk Group's failure to reschedule the Prague meeting fuelled speculation that unanticipated obstacles to the peace process had emerged.Second, a considerable number of minor violations of the ceasefire agreement signed 11 years ago have been registered in recent weeks on the Line of Contact separating Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. At least six servicemen have reportedly been killed in those exchanges of fire (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 23 March 2005). Several Armenian politicians have construed that escalation of low-level hostilities, which Oskanian said on 29 March is the result of Azerbaijani efforts to move their front line closer to Armenian positions, as evidence that Azerbaijan is preparing for a major new offensive -- an assumption that is corroborated by the militant rhetoric of Azerbaijani President Aliev and Defense Minister Colonel General Safar Abiev. Oskanian initially told journalists on 23 March he thinks such rhetoric is intended for a domestic audience, Noyan Tapan reported. But one week later, addressing the Armenian parliament, he admitted the possibility that Baku may seriously intend to start military actions (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 30 March 2005). It is not clear whether, as Oskanian and defense officials from the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) have claimed, Azerbaijan was indeed the aggressor during the recent spate of shootings along the Line of Contact. But it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Baku was prepared to risk provoking such limited exchanges of fire and blaming them on the Armenian side in order to deflect public attention from the recent report released by the OSCE Minsk Group on the situation in the seven districts adjacent to the NKR which are under Armenian control. That report, presented to the OSCE's Permanent Council in Vienna last month, effectively demolishes Azerbaijani allegations that the Armenian government has over the past decade engaged in a deliberate and systematic attempt to resettle tens of thousands of Armenians on those territories. An OSCE fact-finding mission that toured the districts in question in late January and early February at the request of the Azerbaijani government concluded that resettlement is ""quite limited,"" strictly voluntary, and not the result of a deliberate Armenian government policy, and that most of the Armenians resettlers involved are displaced persons from other regions of Azerbaijan. It estimated the total number of such Armenian settlers as less than 15,000, in contrast to Azerbaijani projections of over 30,000 (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 18 March 2005). Despite the recent ceasefire violations, both Oskanian and Mammadyarov remain publicly committed to the search for new blueprints for resolving the conflict -- even though their respective priorities may be difficult to reconcile. On 29 March, Oskanian addressed a special two-day session of the Armenian parliament devoted to the conflict settlement process. As the only senior official in either country who has been actively engaged in that process since the early 1990s, Oskanian provided an overview of the OSCE's efforts to resolve the conflict, which he subdivided into four stages. Oskanian reiterated the three principles which Yerevan considers central to any formal solution: that the unrecognized NKR not be vertically subordinated to the Azerbaijani central government (which would rule out autonomous status, but not a joint or federal state); that the NKR should have an overland link with Armenia (which would entail de facto recognition of Armenian control over the so-called Lachin corridor); and that the security of the Armenian population of the NKR should be guaranteed.At the same time, Oskanian made some statements that are in all likelihood unpalatable, if not anathema, to Baku. He argued that the international community should abandon its insistence that the principle of territorial integrity, which Azerbaijan consistently adduces as central to any settlement of the conflict, should not automatically take precedence over the right to national self-determination. In that context, he cited the examples of East Timor and the ongoing discussion over the future status of Kosova, independence for which could set a precedent for Karabakh. He substantiated the argument in favor of self-determination for the NKR by pointing out, as he has done on previous occasions, that the region has never been part of an independent Azerbaijani state; that it seceded legally from Azerbaijan (in a referendum in September 1991) in accordance with the Soviet legislation in force at that time; and that the Azerbaijani government has had no control whatsoever over the region for the past 15 years, during which time democratization has made far deeper inroads in Karabakh than in Azerbaijan itself. Finally, he argued that by perpetrating violence against the Armenians of the Nagorno-Karabakh when the region was still formally a part of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan ""lost the moral right"" to hegemony over them.Mammadyarov, too, has new suggestions to air at his next meeting with Oskanian, according to OSCE Chairman in Office Dmitrij Rupel, who met with Armenian leaders in Yerevan on 30 March and in Baku with President Aliev and Mammadyarov two days later. Also during his talks with Rupel, Mammadyarov signaled a softening of Azerbaijan's position on one key issue: he admitted that ""sooner or later"" the Armenian community of the NKR should join in the Armenian-Azerbaijani talks on resolving the conflict because ""we cannot take any steps without them,"" according to the independent ANS television station. But Mammadyarov added, ""We think we should continue the talks with Yerevan and achieve some results."" Previously Baku has ruled out the participation of the NKR in such talks unless the Azerbaijanis who fled the enclave in the late 1980s are also included.",,,0

It was extraordinarily successful. But long after the collapse of the Soviet Union it has remained in force for a number of former Soviet states, preventing them from gaining permanent normal trade relations with Washington. Its importance has resurfaced this month as U.S. and Ukrainian officials move to strengthen ties. Ukraine appears ready to join a dozen other former communist states freed from its restrictions. Washington, 7 April 2005 (RFE/RL) -- U.S. Senator Henry Jackson and Representative Charles Vanik sponsored their measure in 1974 as a response to severe restrictions the Soviet Union had placed on the emigration of its citizens.The Jackson-Vanik amendment conditioned certain trade benefits on criteria related to free emigration from non-market economy countries. It proved particularly effective in freeing up the emigration of Soviet Jews.Most states have now met the free emigration criteria. The formal lifting of the measure has become part of a rite of passage for reformist countries of the former Soviet bloc.Most states have now met the free emigration criteria. The formal lifting of the measure has become part of a rite of passage for reformist countries of the former Soviet bloc. The latest case up for serious review in the U.S. Congress is Ukraine.President Viktor Yushchenko, addressing a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, appealed for the lifting of the measure as ""Members of Congress, I'm calling on you to lift the Jackson- Vanik amendment [applause], to make this step towards Ukraine. Tear down this wall,"" Yushchenko said.The United States routinely gives Ukraine and a number of other states (including Belarus, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) yearly waivers exempting them from the measure. But these states still lack permanent normal trade relations, seen as inhibiting foreign investment, long-term contracts, and membership in the World Trade Organization.The Baltic states, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and four Eastern European states have been ""graduated"" out of the measure over the last 15 years.There have been mounting calls to add Ukraine to this group. However, some in the U.S. Congress have sought to maintain the measure as a lever to improve Ukraine's performance in intellectual-property protection. Similarly, Russia has sought normalized trade relations, but a dispute over restrictions on U.S. chicken imports has stalled that initiative. Some supporters of the Jackson-Vanik amendment are now calling for it to be phased out.One of them is Michael McFaul, a senior fellow and Russia expert at the Hoover Institution, a research body based in the United States. He tells RFE/RL the Jackson-Vanik amendment achieved its intended effect and has now become distorted in practice:""I think it is important to be tough on the Ukrainians on intellectual property law that they do not enforce and on the Russians that have tariffs that we think are unfair,"" McFaul says.""But what I don't think is proper is to link that to legislation that was designed for another purpose.""The measure is widely considered a great success. More than 1.5 million Jews are estimated to have emigrated to the United States and Israel since the amendment took effect.But its continued application could raise questions about U.S. abuse of the procedure. Paul Saunders is the director of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based policy institute. He says that, especially in Russia, failure to lift restrictions related to the amendment is breeding cynicism:""It can create an impression among some people that we don't live up to our commitments or that, alternatively, that we're just trying to maintain any kind of leverage that we can use against other people whenever we need it for whatever political reason we decide to use at the time,"" Saunders says.The U.S.-funded Congressional Research Service said in a recent report that the amendment is unlikely to be repealed any time soon. The report's author, trade specialist Vladimir Pregelj, tells RFE/RL that Congress has so far indicated its intent to maintain the measure as a trade lever, even while it individually removes countries from its restrictions:""I think the Congress would prefer to stick on this country-by- country termination [rather] than a wholesale repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment,"" Pregelj says.Pregelj says there are currently six bills in the U.S. Congress aimed at removing Ukraine from the amendment's restrictions.After a meeting with the Ukrainian president on Monday, U.S. President George W. Bush vowed to lift the restrictions. In addition, the U.S. Senate, as part of a foreign aid bill, this week was considering an amendment to normalize trade relations with Ukraine.",,,

The theme of this year's World Health Day -- observed today -- is the well-being of mothers and children around the world. Prague, 7 April 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Bibigula lives in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, a country with one of the highest levels of infant and maternal mortality in the world.""There is not a home where there is not concern,"" Bibigula told RFE/RL's Afghan Service ""Our neighbor, who had three children, became pregnant for the fourth time. I was there during her delivery. She was in bad condition. After the delivery of the baby, we were waiting for her placenta. She had massive bleeding, but we did not have a health center to visit. She had retention of her placenta. Her abdomen looked swollen. Finally, because of losing a lot of blood, she closed her eyes forever, and her innocent children lost their mother.""Almost three-quarters of all maternal deaths are caused by five factors -- hemorrhaging, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure, and obstructed labor.Sadly, Bibigula's story is an everyday occurrence in most of the world's developing countries -- a fact borne out by the findings in the World Health Organization's ""World Health Report 2005,"" which was released today.The statistics are staggering.Joy Phumaphi, assistant director-general of family and community health at the WHO, calls it an epidemic, with 11 million children under the age of 5 dying each year. Mothers are also dying in numbers difficult to comprehend:""It is absolutely unacceptable that as I speak to you today, every minute we are losing a woman, a young girl, in childbirth and in pregnancy,"" Phumaphi said. ""It is equally unacceptable that every year we lose 4 million children before they reach the age of 28 days to preventable causes.""As Phumaphi says, most of these deaths are entirely preventable, through common and affordable health practices and medicines.Almost three-quarters of all maternal deaths are caused by five factors -- hemorrhaging, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure, and obstructed labor. The greatest threats to newborns include things such as low birth weight and birth trauma, severe infections -- such as pneumonia -- and sicknesses, including diarrhea.Thomson Prentice, managing editor of the ""World Health Report 2005,"" says, ""These are not necessarily complicated or serious conditions in the sense that there is no treatment or intervention possible. There are many, many treatments and interventions that can be applied at no great cost or without any great need for high technology that would make the difference between life and death for mother and child.""But how much of an impact can a UN report really have?Prentice believes the ""World Health Report 2005"" can make a substantial difference in the way in which countries view the health of mothers and children. But he acknowledges that the effects are long-term -- that there won't be sudden visible changes in people's health or even in the development of policies that would have rapid impacts. That's simply not the way governments tend to work, he says:""What we do know is that in previous reports, the recommendations have been widely accepted around the world. Many countries have made policy changes within their own health systems that take on board much of the information and advice that the report contains.""The goal, he says, is for each country to adapt the report's recommendations to suit its particular health systems.The WHO report strongly emphasizes the need for what it calls a ""continuum of care"" -- providing support for women and children throughout the entire pregnancy cycle, from the earliest stages, through delivery, and into those crucial hours, days, and weeks after birth:""What has been the case until now [in many countries] is there has been rather a compartmentalization of care. Somebody's responsible for antenatal care for a woman, but not particularly concerned with the birth of the child. Somebody's concerned with the birth of a child, but not much concerned with its later development, and so on.""Doctor Wim Van Lerberghe, is editor in chief of the new WHO study, says the report classifies countries into four groups -- those that are making good progress toward maternal and infant mortality goals; those that are making slower progress; those that are stagnating; and those that had once made progress but are now in reversal: ""Good progress are countries like Albania, Armenia, Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia -- countries like that. Countries that are making slower progress [include] Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Tajikistan,"" Van Lerberghe says. That means that child mortality is reducing, but not as fast as in the preceding group.""Iran is considered to be making good progress, while Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan are classified as making slower progress.Afghanistan is one of those countries that is stagnant -- remaining at extremely high levels of maternal and infant mortality. But the worst category, Van Lerberghe says, includes those places that at one time appeared to be making progress but are now slipping back -- countries like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iraq. Top model Liya Kebede is the WHO's new goodwill ambassador for maternal, newborn, and child health. She says she was shocked to learn that 500,000 women die during pregnancy each year, most of them from developing nations such as her own -- Ethiopia:""The sad fact is that they are largely ignored -- a baby is buried, a mother is mourned, and a family grieves invisible to the rest of the world,"" Kebede says. ""It is inconceivable that in the early part of the 21st century, mothers and children continue to die when solutions exist.""The WHO says the lives of more than 6 million children could be saved each year by a few simple steps, such as vaccines and common treatments for serious illnesses. These interventions are possible even in the poorest countries.",,,

(file photo) Following uprisings in Georgia and Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akaev last week became the third post-Soviet leader in recent months to be felled by a popular uprising. The speed of Akaev's demise surprised many observers, prompting questions about what made his regime so fragile. Some are now asking who will be next in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)? Prague, 31 March 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Kyrgyzstan's deposed president had blunt advice from his forced exile in Russia this week.In an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio, Akaev was asked what he would counsel his fellow CIS presidents if they faced popular uprisings that threatened to topple their governments. His answer: Learn from my mistake; use force.""What lesson did I learn from the March 24 events?"" Akaev said. ""Our democracy is still weak, and it cannot protect itself. So I would advise my colleagues to protect democratic gains, including with the use of force if needed.""It is easy to see how Akaev might draw such a conclusion. If the Georgian, Ukrainian, and Kyrgyz popular uprisings have one thing in common, it is that they succeeded in part because massive force was not employed against unarmed demonstrators.The key ingredients to a popular uprising seem to be clear: a corrupt government that cannot distribute favors to enough people to maintain support, perceived economic hardship, and traces of democracy and partial freedom of the press -- so that people become aware of the problem.But few observers believe violence would have stabilized the situation in any of these countries.If a leader is confronted with the choice between fleeing and shooting his own people, the situation has already spun out of control. The more interesting question, say analysts, is how Akaev was backed into a corner -- and whether his mistakes are being repeated by other leaders in the CIS, making them vulnerable?Sergei Luzyanin of the Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) says Akaev made several cardinal mistakes that weakened his rule. The first was to violate an unspoken power-sharing agreement between representatives of the country's northern and southern clans. Akaev, a northerner, kept all the patronage posts for his northern allies.""Traditionally, especially at the local government level, even back in the Soviet period, there was a regular alternation between the northern and southern clans,"" Luzyanin says. ""Under Akaev, this regular exchange was disrupted, and the northern clan --- Akaev's clan -- controlled the southern regions and the southern clans were dissatisfied. This is why Osh, Jalal-Abad, Batken blew up -- because a feeling of social injustice has accumulated there during the 14 years of Akaev's rule. The unspoken rule [about the alternation between north and south], which had always been observed, was broken.""Akaev went one step further, gradually bringing his extended family into the political process. Such nepotism came at the expense of even his northern political backers, breeding resentment within his own bureaucracy. This turned into his Achilles' heel, says Luzyanin, as civil servants lost any sense of loyalty to the regime.""[The civil servants] all were saying: 'We're against him. But we're biding our time, and as soon as we see the first signal, we will hand over our boss.' Which is exactly what happened,"" says Luzyanin. ""Seventy percent of government bureaucrats -- including some very important ones -- as soon as it became clear that Akaev's power was set to crumble, immediately switched to the other side, either by directly backing them or at least remaining neutral in relation to the opposition.""Thanks to a faltering economy, aspects of a free press, and the presence of nongovernmental organizations, many Kyrgyz were aware of the situation and deeply dissatisfied.Murad Esenov, editor of the Sweden-based ""Central Asia and the Caucasus"" journal, says the fact that Kyrgyzstan -- like Georgia and Ukraine -- was relatively more democratic than other CIS countries speeded the demise of the regime.""Many people think the Akaev regime fell very quickly, but I don't share this opinion,"" Esenov says. ""You need to look at what came before recent events. We know very well that in Kyrgyzstan, nongovernmental organizations and a [partially] free media functioned, and they had been criticizing the government's policies very harshly, for a very long time. Since the government wasn't doing a very good job, public opinion against the government had already been formed.""The key ingredients to a popular uprising seem to be clear: a corrupt government that cannot distribute favors to enough people to maintain support, perceived economic hardship, and traces of democracy and partial freedom of the press -- so that people become aware of the problem.In the case of Ukraine, the economy was not failing. But analysts say there was no trickle-down effect. Because of corruption, few people sensed any improvement in their economic situation, despite statistics.Lastly, rigged elections triggered public outcry in all three cases -- Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan.If there is one country in the CIS that best matches these criteria, says Esenov, it is arguably Kazakhstan. Like the Kyrgyz president, Kazakhstan's leader, Nursultan Nazarbaev, has concentrated power in his extended family. The Kyrgyz economy is doing well on paper, but few people benefit. And thanks to partial freedom of the press, the Kyrgyz public is informed and opposition movements are growing.""In Kazakhstan, the people do have a certain amount of room to express their opinion,"" Esenov says. ""When people can express their opinions and the government has become mired in corruption, naturally you get a situation, such as the one we saw in Georgia and Ukraine and in Kyrgyzstan.""""In Kazakhstan, the opposition is stronger, better organized, and more united. It is also true that the authorities are also more organized, tougher, and more motivated that the Akaev leadership."" -- Sergei Luzyanin, Moscow Institute for International RelationsLuzyanin agrees. But he also says Nazarbaev has more at stake than Akaev. That makes a confrontation with the opposition potentially more dangerous.""In Kazakhstan, the opposition is stronger, better organized, and more united,"" Luzyanin says. ""It is also true that the authorities are also more organized, tougher, and more motivated that the Akaev leadership. Akaev was on his way out; he was nearing the end of his term and he was not so motivated. But it's a different matter for Nazarbaev. It is absolutely clear that an escalation of this political struggle will now shift to Kazakhstan. And it will be more systematic and on a larger scale. The ultimate results are not clear. We cannot say that the opposition will triumph next year or at the end of this year. But the fact that the political situation will heat up is clear.""Some people have also pointed to Azerbaijan as a possible candidate for unrest, noting upcoming elections in November and previous clashes between the government and opposition. But Esenov believes the economic situation in the country is less dire than in Central Asia, making a revolution scenario less likely.""In Baku, unlike in Georgia or Kyrgyzstan, there is not the same degree of poverty,"" Esenov says. ""There is not the same level of unemployment. These factors, I believe, make the prospect of a revolution in Baku more distant. I don't think there will be a revolution in Baku, in connection with the elections in November. Although there is dissatisfaction, undeniably, it has not taken over society to an overwhelming degree.""Esenov also says that, unlike their Kazakh counterparts, the Azerbaijani authorities have made a significant effort to co-opt the nation's young people and university students, to keep them off the streets.""In Azerbaijan, young people and students have been largely drawn into politics -- but on the government's side,"" he says. ""For example, the youth wing of the [ruling] party -- Yeni Azerbaijan -- has been very active. The youth wing of the party is active in all institutions of higher learning. They have meetings with students, hold discussions, even readings of [President Heydar] Aliev's works. They know that youth are the driving force of any revolution and this pro-government party is doing its utmost to co-opt young people and bring them under their influence. And I have not seen this in Kazakhstan.""If a country's leader is unable to deliver tangible economic benefits to the people and wants to remain in power, is the answer to clamp down on democratic movements? The apparent stability of highly autocratic regimes in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Belarus would seem to indicate ""yes.""Popular dissatisfaction is subjective by nature, so if people are n-o-t aware of alternatives, they might continue to passively support a repressive regime. But Luzyanin says this cannot continue over the long term and, as with the former USSR, apparent stability can be illusory.""[These regimes] are more stable. But it does not mean that the system is strong,"" he says. ""The paradox is that the harsher the regime, and the more it outwardly resembles a fortress, the quicker it can collapse -- all at once. History knows many such examples.""As Ukraine's Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko noted last week, there will be other revolutions in the CIS. When and where remains the big question. But they will happen, she and other successful revolutionaries believe.",,,

Such caution is to be expected in a region populated by regimes with notoriously spotty records on democracy and human rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped into that void during a visit to Armenia on Friday, condemning what he described as ""illegitimate"" efforts to overthrow the Kyrgyz government. But he also hastened to say that Moscow knows the Kyrgyz opposition well and wants to maintain relations with Bishkek. Prague, 25 March 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Speaking during an official visit to the Transcaucasus, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed disappointment over the way events transpired in nearby Kyrgyzstan.""It is regrettable that once again, political problems in a post-Soviet country are being resolved in an illegitimate way and are accompanied by chaos and casualties,"" Putin said.But the Russian leader also suggested that Moscow is ready to cooperate with the ascendant Kyrgyz opposition. Putin praised them for their contributions to bilateral relations between Russia and Kyrgyzstan:""We know these people [the opposition] very well,"" Putin said. ""They helped develop relations between Kyrgyzstan and the Russian Federation when they held government positions for several years in the past. They have done a lot to establish today's level of bilateral relations.""Russia's unique position at the heart of the former Soviet empire gives it considerable influence -- both direct and indirect -- in Central Asia.Veterans Of RevolutionMeanwhile, government leaders in Ukraine and Georgia -- where recent revolutions toppled post-Soviet leaders in favor of reform-minded opposition movements -- on Friday urged peaceful solutions to the problems in Kyrgyzstan. They also offered their governments' help. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko: ""Georgia's Rose Revolution and Ukraine's Orange Revolution are both good answers to how such conflicts can be settled. Of course, we are offering our assistance in resolving this national conflict [in Kyrgyzstan].""Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili added that while Georgia's sympathies are with the Kyrgyz opposition, Tbilisi is not in the business of exporting trouble.""We are not exporters of revolutions,"" Saakashvili said. ""Our revolutions were similar [to Kyrgyz events]. That was not because someone fabricated them somewhere, but simply because people react to injustice in the same way in all countries.""Tight-Lipped Officials In Central AsiaAmong Central Asian states like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, official reaction has ranged from cautious to nonexistent.Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev offered his explanation of events in Kyrgyzstan to a group of business leaders in Astana today. He blamed ousted Kyrgyz President Akaev's neglect of economic and social factors during more than a decade of rule. Nazarbaev said the Kyrgyz opposition was fueled by poverty and social ills, and the uprising made possible by lax security measures.""It is absolutely clear that social and economic problems that accumulated for years in [Kyrgyzstan] have led to mass poverty and unemployment,"" Nazarbaev said. ""This sparked unrest in many parts of the country. The weakness of the authorities also played its negative role in allowing rioters and thugs to act as they pleased.""Meanwhile, Turkmenistan's state-owned print and electronic media avoided altogether reporting on events in Kyrgyzstan.The Uzbek Foreign Ministry issued a statement today saying that events in Kyrgyzstan should be resolved ""within the legal framework and laws outlined in the constitution."" It said Uzbekistan presumes that the events of the last days and weeks ""are not spontaneous processes,"" but are the result of the ""long accumulated ... resentment of the population, which is unhappy with its appalling socio-economic conditions, hopelessness, and corruption."" The statement said Uzbekistan is ready to cooperate with a Kyrgyz leadership, government and parliament that has the ""support and trust of the population.""The government in Tajikistan has maintained official silence. Both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan closed their borders at the height of the demonstrations to avoid the spread of instability. Opposition AdmirersOpposition parties across the region -- from the Caucasus to Central Asia -- have been more outspoken.One of the leaders of Kazakhstan's Ak Zhol opposition party, Bolat Abilov, told RFE/RL that yesterday's events in Kyrgyzstan carry a lesson for any dictators in the region.""It is astounding,"" Abilov said. ""It is a message for other dictators that changes are necessary, that people need fair elections, that people simply need decent elections. That is the main point.""A bloc of Kazakh opposition parties known as For A Fair Kazakhstan said in an open letter to the Kyrgyz people today that Kazakhs are proud of their Kyrgyz neighbors. They congratulated the Kyrgyz people for overthrowing what they describe as an ""authoritarian"" regime that was ""based on clan and family relations.""The political opposition in Azerbaijan also welcomed the changes in Kyrgyzstan. Isa Ganbar of Azerbaijan's Musavat (Equality) Party said the demonstrations clearly showed that people are losing patience with lies and dictatorship.Iqbal Agazade of the Umid (Hope) party suggested that events in Kyrgyzstan might eventually provide a boost to the Azerbaijani or Armenian oppositions. But he predicted that the early effects will be strongest among Kyrgyzstan's immediate neighbors.""I wouldn't say that Kyrgyz developments would have an immediate effect on Azerbaijan or Armenia,"" Agazade said. ""Surely it will affect -- especially Azerbaijan -- psychologically. But not in a direct way.

Prosecutors say the case raises alarm over the willingness of traffickers to sell arms to terrorists. New York, 16 March 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Prosecutors allege that the defendants were preparing to import various assault weapons -- including antitank missile systems -- into the United States from countries in Eastern Europe.The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, David Kelley, said in announcing the arrests on 15 March that the suspects have been under close surveillance for more than one year.""As part of the overall scheme,"" Kelly said, ""five of the defendants were charged with plotting to import into the United States various military weapons, including rocket-propelled grenade launchers, which are known as RPGs, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, known as SAMs, and those were from Armenia, the Republic of Georgia, and other Eastern European countries.""""The criminal complaint charging the defendants reads like a Hollywood script, with one important distinction.

It didn't happen.""Two of the alleged ringleaders were identified as Artur Solomonyan, an Armenian citizen living in New York and Los Angeles, and Christiaan Dewet Spies, a South African citizen also living in New York. Another defendant, Vato Machitidze, was shown on television as he was led handcuffed after his arrest in Manhattan.A criminal complaint charged five of the participants with conspiring to transport destructive devices and 13 others with weapons trafficking. One of the 13 is still at large.The FBI says the suspects proposed selling weapons to one of its informants who was posing as an arms buyer with ties to Al-Qaeda. They supplied him with digital pictures from a warehouse allegedly in Armenia, showing caches of Russian-made weapons.

Among the other weapons offered for sale was the Igla missile, a shoulder-fired heat-seeking missile that can shoot down a commercial airplane. The FBI says the defendants actually sold one of their informants eight machine guns and assault weapons, delivering them to warehouses in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. The agency alleges the defendants offered to provide many more sophisticated weapons. The FBI says there were also discussions at some point concerning the delivery of uranium to be used for attacks in U.S. subways.If convicted on all charges, the two alleged ringleaders each face up to 30 years in prison.Authorities say the FBI is working with Armenian and Russian authorities to secure the weapons that were bound for the United States.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1057977.html,Russias Wounded Imperial Consciousness ,"March 15, 2005 08:58 GMT",,,"Whither the CIS? Many observers in Russia and abroad believe that recent events in Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova have rung the death knell for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the fragile association that rose up in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Council for Foreign and Defense Policy Chairman Sergei Karaganov told RTR on 13 March that the CIS has essentially fulfilled its function and should be radically reformed. On 10 March, apn.ru reported that National Strategy Institute Director Stanislav Belkovskii had called for ""burying the CIS"" and creating a new alliance of countries loyal to Moscow. Belkovskii dubbed this alliance the USSR, an acronym from the Russian words for ""Commonwealth of Countries Allied to Russia.""The latest reflection of this new mindset in Russia was a proposed bill in the Duma that would have regulated the procedures for expanding the Russian Federation. On 10 March, Motherland Duma Deputy Andrei Savelev presented the bill on the creation of new constituents of the Russian Federation that would have amended a 2001 law on the Russian Federation (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 3 December 2001) to facilitate the incorporation into Russia of the self-proclaimed republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are part of Georgia; the Moldovan region of Transdniester; and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.""Now is not the time to think about how to break up other states but to take care about the unity and sovereignty of our own country.""Under the 2001 law, regions wishing to join the federation do not have to share borders with Russia, but the consent of their present central governments is required for incorporation. The law also stipulates that acceptance of new constituents of the federation must be approved by a referendum of the entire country. In short, the expansion of the Russian Federation requires an international treaty and a complete, national domestic political process.According to media reports, the amendments submitted by Savelev were drafted by Motherland faction leader Dmitrii Rogozin. They called for abolishing the requirement that expansion be accompanied by the consent of the foreign government involved, ""Izvestiya"" reported on 10 March. Instead, the proposed amendments stated that admission to the federation would be based only on ""the will of the people of a region as expressed through a referendum"" or by the mass acceptance of Russian citizenship. The only new condition that the amendments included was a provision that said the population of a candidate region must have voted ""positively on the 17 March 1991 referendum on the preservation of the USSR."" All of the regions listed above pass this standard, a fact that Rogozin mentioned in a memorandum he attached to the bill. In that message, he wrote that Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan ""have lately been intensifying efforts to project their sovereignty into the territories of these unrecognized republics"" while simultaneously accusing Russia of ""supporting 'separatism.'""When presenting the bill in the Duma, Savelev stressed that the proposals correspond with the Kremlin's political line and its ""ideology of national revanche."" ""President [Vladimir] Putin said last year that we gave up too much and [now] we must get it all back,"" Savelev said, according to strana.ru on 11 March. ""We do not need a new Russia of 'Yeltsinites' within the present borders, but a genuine Russia with its imperial borders.""The Motherland bill, however, attracted just 91 votes -- mainly from Motherland and its allies -- of the 226 required for passage. Thirty-four deputies voted against the bill and one abstained, with most deputies not participating in the vote. The pro-Kremlin Unified Russia party, which controls more than 300 votes in the lower chamber, declined to support the bill, arguing that it could destroy ""the fragile balance of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.""Unified Russia's position seems to follow the old dictum that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Deputy Yurii Konev (Unified Russia) said: ""The time for this law has passed. Now is not the time to think about how to break up other states but to take care about the unity and sovereignty of our own country,"" strana.ru reported on 11 March.Konev's concerns were echoed by Communist Deputy Leonid Ivanchenko, whose faction largely supported the measure. Ivanchenko, however, argued that the definition of ""a popular referendum"" in the bill ""works against Russia's interests."" He noted that the Myasnikovskii Raion of Rostov Oblast, which is in the district he represents, has a compact Armenian community, RTR reported on 12 March, and that it could theoretically vote to secede from Russia. First Deputy Duma Speaker Lyubov Slizka (Unified Russia) concluded the debate by saying that ""adoption of the bill will mean the de facto declaration of war against neighboring states, whose territorial integrity will be violated."" She added that it would be another matter if one or another of these regions gained international recognition and then expressed the desire to join the Russian Federation.In an interview with ""Argumenty i fakty,"" No. 10, TV-Tsentr commentator Aleksei Pushkov, whose statist views often reflect those of the Kremlin, said that Moscow is afraid to encourage separatist claims in Georgia and Moldova because it faces the same problem in Chechnya. Moreover, if Moscow legitimizes the disintegration of Georgia and Moldova, it could set off a chain reaction in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, both of which have large ethnic Russian minorities concentrated in regions bordering Russia. ""It seems that the Kremlin is seriously afraid of complications in our relations with our neighbors, although as far as I can tell there is nothing to be afraid of,"" Pushkov said.The introduction of the bill in the Duma indicates that those in Russia who harbor imperialist ambitions are not yet ready to surrender, despite the recent setbacks throughout the CIS. After Moscow's defeat in the Ukrainian presidential vote, political consultant Marat Gelman, who advised pro-Moscow presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych in the election there, said that ""Russia should now give up its imperial project,"" RosBalt reported on 29 December. ""But although there is no chance of realizing any scenario of the restoration of the empire, our wounded imperial consciousness remains and is posing a serious problem.""",,,

The reports are an important step as the three states move toward closer alignment with the EU. The so-called neighborhood action plans outline specific reforms the EU expects of the countries and details the advantages the bloc will offer in return. Brussels, 2 March 2005 (RFE/RL) -- Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan have taken another important step on the road toward closer alignment with the EU. On 2 March, the European Commission adopted ""country reports"" on the three south Caucasus states, as well as Lebanon and Egypt. The reports are a detailed overview of the countries' progress toward adopting EU values such as rule of law, democracy, and a market economy.Francoise Le Bail, a Commission spokeswoman, said the decision marks the completion of the first phase the EU's Neighborhood Policy -- the bloc's program to reach out to countries on its rim.""These are measures within the framework of the neighborhood policy, which is a policy directed at countries to the east of the enlarged European Union, as well as the Mediterranean countries. We have already adopted a certain number of 'country reports' and 'action plans' for some countries, we're therefore now completing this action with the 'country reports' on five countries.""Le Bail said that the completion puts the states on the way to obtaining their own EU neighbourhood action plan. The action plans detail obligations on both sides for increased cooperation. ""These are measures within the framework of the neighborhood policy, which is a policy directed at countries to the east of the enlarged European Union, as well as the Mediterranean countries,"" Le Bail said. ""We have already adopted a certain number of 'country reports' and 'action plans' for some countries, we're therefore now completing this action with the 'country reports' on five countries. And it is on the these 'country reports' that the 'action plans -- containing concrete measures for cooperation between these countries and the EU -- will be based.""The EU neighborhood policy is directed at a ring of countries stretching from Morocco to Ukraine and Moldova. Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan were initially excluded from the policy, but were taken on board largely as a result of the ""Rose revolution"" in Georgia that took place in November 2003.The three south Caucasus countries, together with Lebanon and Egypt, should have their ""action plans"" by the end of the year. So far, Israel, Ukraine and Jordan have already signed theirs, with Morocco, Moldova, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia about to do so.The Commission has in recent months repeatedly stressed the neighborhood policy does not carry with it an EU commitment to eventually admit any of the beneficiary countries. The clarifications have been partly sparked by pressure from Ukraine to be put on a fast track to EU membership.Another Commission official who asked not to be named explained on 2 March that the action plans consist of what he called two ""baskets.""The first basket contains conditions set by the EU -- that is, reforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law, democracy and respect for human rights, as well as certain foreign policy commitments, such as non-proliferation and counter-terrorism measures. These, the official said, are all specific measures which the EU will closely measure. The other ""basket"" contains the EU offer. This could involve participation in EU programs, policies and agencies, approximation of national law with EU legislation to make cooperation and trade easier, and opportunities for people-to-people contacts.The further countries go with reforms, the greater the degree of cooperation the EU will offer. EU officials say that once the three-year action plans have successfully run their course, new and more extensive cooperation agreements may be offered. The neighbourhood policy could lead to a near-complete integration in the EU's single market. On 1 March, RFE/RL spoke with Georgian Foreign Minister Salome Zurabishvili. She welcomed the Commission's decision regarding her country, but indicated it had been a long time coming. ""[We react] very positively,"" Zurabishvili said. ""We've been looking forward to that, already for some time since our versions of the country reports were transmitted to the EU already in the fall of last year, so we've been waiting for quite some time."" Georgia is seen by the EU as the most advanced nation in the region. It hosts the only full European Commission mission. There is a smaller ""regional mission"" in Yerevan, which reports to the one in Tbilisi. A similar small-scale mission will be launched this year in Baku. Georgia's country report is the least critical, with relatively few problems identified when in comes to political reforms. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are criticized for deficient legislation, breaches of fundamental freedoms and a general lack of willingness to reform. The reports note widespread Russian influence on decision-making in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. The EU has no immediate plans to become directly involved in helping resolve the region's so-called frozen conflicts. However, it is currently considering setting up a border monitoring mission in Georgia and has contributed funds to the economic rehabilitation of areas affected by conflict. Commission officials say they are confident Russia will not react negatively to EU moves to engage the South Caucasus, though they admit security cooperation in the ex-Soviet space is one of the most sensitive issues in EU-Russia attempts to agree a framework for their strategic partnership.Officials in Brussels say the EU has made it very clear the bloc is not intent on weakening Russian influence in the region and encourages governments in the South Caucasus to pursue good relations with Moscow.",,,

Tengiz Kitovani's National Guard was instrumental in ousting Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in late 1991. Soon afterward, together with Djaba Ioseliani's Mkhedrioni, Kitovani's group triggered wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. An informal militia subordinate to the Azerbaijan Popular Front helped thwart a comeback attempt in May 1992 by President Ayaz Mutalibov. A second private army helped rebel Colonel Suret Huseinov topple Mutalibov's successor, Abulfaz Elchibey, in June 1993, paving the way for the return to Baku of former Communist Party of Azerbaijan First Secretary Heidar Aliyev. And in Armenia, the Yerkrapah detachments formed by Vazgen Sargsian to fight in the Karabakh war rose to political prominence, catapulting Sargsian to the post of defense minister and then prime minister.Huseinov was effectively neutralized in early 1995, and Kitovani and Ioseliani by the end of that year. True, in Georgia guerrilla bands enjoying covert support from the Georgian government continued to target CIS peacekeepers and Abkhaz customs officials in Abkhazia -- but at least those detachments were firmly under the control of the regime. Elsewhere in the South Caucasus, however, they appeared to have disbanded.A Reemergence?In recent weeks, however, there have been reports of the reemergence of such forces in both Azerbaijan and Armenia. In Azerbaijan, the independent daily newspaper ""Azadliq"" reported on 1 February that the CIA warned President Ilham Aliyev one month previously that the head of a government agency had allegedly created his own private army numbering 150-200 fighters with ""advanced military training."" ""Azadlig"" did not name the Azerbaijani official in question. Aliyev has since assured Washington that the army in question has been disarmed, according to ""Azadliq."" The paper claimed that the CIA's primary concern was that the militia in question could sabotage ""strategic installations,"" possibly meaning the unfinished Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline or the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline. But such a private army could also be mobilized during the Azerbaijani parliamentary elections due in November. The daily ""Vatandash Hamrayliyi"" newspaper claimed on 9 February, citing governmental sources, that two powerful and wealthy government officials, State Customs Committee Chairman Kamaladdin Heydarov and Economic Development Minister Farhad Aliyev (no relation to the president), planned to create their personal blocs to participate in those elections.Trouble In ArmeniaIn Yerevan, President Robert Kocharian's national security adviser, Garnik Isagulian, was quoted by ""Hayots ashkhar"" on 15 February as expressing concern over recent armed clashes between rival business clans and calling for immediate measures to put an end to such lawlessness. ""Many of our wealthy persons have created bodyguard structures,"" Isagulian explained. ""Some of them even have personal security services."" One man died and two others were injured in the latest such shootout, on 4 February, apparently between armed supporters of rival ""mafias"" (see ""Three Men Arrested After Deadly Shootout In Yerevan""). On 8 February, the same paper reported unconfirmed rumors that individuals close to Yerevan officials or to past of present parliament deputies were involved in the 4 February gun battle.

She said the EU would pursue its neighborhood policy with the aim of establishing closer ties with these countries. However, she indicated EU membership for Ukraine -- or others -- was not on offer. She also said the EU would continue trying to engage Russia within the framework provided by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), despite Moscow's growing unwillingness to reciprocate. Brussels, 26 January 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The European Union is struggling to find its feet in the aftermath of the Ukrainian electoral crisis.The success of Viktor Yushchenko in Ukraine's presidential elections, coming just a year after the similar triumph of Mikheil Saakashvili in Georgia, has caught the bloc off guard. The EU has found itself ill prepared for requests for closer ties coming from both leaders, and fears a confrontation with Russia.These tensions were abundantly in evidence yesterday as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner addressed the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament in Brussels.Much of her discussion with the European deputies revolved around Russia and Ukraine.Ferrero-Waldner said Russia must not view the EU's evolving neighborhood policy -- targeting, among others, Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus -- as something that is designed to reduce its own influence.Ferrero-Waldner said she would visit Moscow in early March. She said a ""lot of patience"" would be needed to enlist Russia's cooperation, but she said the EU expected to overcome it and would continue to pursue its neighborhood policy. ""We have witnessed the emergence of a more assertive and generally also well articulated Russian foreign policy vis-a-vis the new independent states,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""Our challenge now is to try to reverse Russia's drift to a bloc mentality. I think our priority must be to find ways to overcome Russia's very defensive behavior and especially the idea that this is a zero-sum attitude to cooperation with the European Union in [its] New Neighborhood countries. And also to be able to realize our ambitions in the European Neighborhood Policy, which, of course, go out also to Moldova and go out also to Belarus [as well as Ukraine].""Ferrero-Waldner said Russia remained an important ""strategic political partner"" for the EU, as well as a key market. But, she warned, the EU itself must send Russia ""solid messages,"" with the whole bloc standing by jointly agreed positions. This is a reference to recurring differences among EU member states over how to treat Russia.The commissioner said that the EU must cooperate especially closely within the OSCE, which so far has been the leading forum for discussing issues related to Russia and its neighbors. She said the EU had in the past ""tried very hard"" to negotiate solutions to conflicts in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Moldova. But, she noted, there was ""not enough political will."" Much of this had to do with the EU, she said, which ""must do its best to speak with one voice.""Speaking before the same parliamentary committee on 24 January, the EU's foreign-policy coordinator, Javier Solana, appeared to rule out a direct EU role in the region's conflicts.Ferrero-Waldner said she would visit Moscow in early March. She said a ""lot of patience"" would be needed to enlist Russia's cooperation, but she said the EU expected to overcome it and would continue to pursue its neighborhood policy.""We know that it is not easy for Russia, as there is a feeling that we encroach too strongly upon their 'sphere.' But on the other hand, it is extremely important to lead these countries again toward us,"" Ferrero-Waldner said. ""And this is actually the very idea behind the neighborhood policy. I hope that we can make headway here, even if slowly.""Meanwhile, the EU is continuing to fight off pressure to agree that countries such as Ukraine have an eventual right to membership in the bloc.Ferrero-Waldner called yesterday for a ""pragmatic and realistic"" approach, saying the EU was still struggling to digest 2004's 10 entrants. She said many other possibilities than membership were open to Ukraine, adding the EU was not prepared to go beyond the action plan presently being offered to Kyiv.Although Ukraine's new leadership has not directly raised the issue of EU membership, President Viktor Yushchenko has made it clear he sees his country's future in full integration with Euro-Atlantic structures.The EU's basic treaty says that every European country can apply for membership. Ferrero-Waldner repeated this yesterday on several occasions, but refrained from describing Ukraine as a European state. A European Commission spokeswoman said later that the commission had ""no opinion"" at the present time on whether Ukraine is a European country or not.Privately, officials speak of a ""triangular"" relationship with Ukraine, acknowledging an important role for Moscow. Yushchenko -- who is due to address the European Parliament in Brussels tomorrow -- is being praised by EU officials for having paid his first visit abroad to Moscow on 24 January. Solana indicated that the EU was unwilling to address the issue of formally upgrading its relations with Ukraine until 2008.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1057090.html,Analysis Council Of Europe Calls For Talks Between Azerbaijan Karabakh Leadership ,"January 26, 2005 15:56 GMT",,,"In the late summer of 2004, British parliamentarian David Atkinson, who succeeded Terry Davis as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's (PACE) rapporteur for Nagorno-Karabakh, was tasked with completing a report begun by Davis for the assembly on the situation in the disputed region. Even though such reports, when adopted, are only recommendations, ever since that draft was unveiled two months ago, legislators and political commentators in both Armenia and Azerbaijan have evaluated, and lobbied to amend, criticisms they consider unwarranted and terminology they consider inappropriate or misleading.Specifically, the Armenian side objected from the outset to the assertion that ""considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan are still occupied by Armenian forces, and separatist forces are still in control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region."" The Armenian PACE delegation sought to substitute ""supporters of democracy"" for the term ""separatist forces,"" presumably in order to underscore that the elections that have taken place in the disputed republic were free and democratic, in contrast to those in Azerbaijan that the OSCE has consistently criticized as not meeting international standards for free and fair elections. The Armenian side also considered inappropriate the use of the term ""ethnic cleansing"" in connection with the exodus from the region of its minority Azerbaijani population.The Davis/Atkinson report was the subject of a three-hour debate on 25 January during the PACE winter session. The Armenian delegation's efforts to tone down wording that it considered unfair proved largely unsuccessful, partly, delegation head Tigran Torosian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on 20 January, due to lack of Russian support. According to zerkalo.az on 26 January, most speakers expressed support for Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from areas bordering on Karabakh. The report was finally approved by a vote of 123 in favor and seven against. Moreover, the final version of the report terms the occupation of the territory of one Council of Europe member state by another ""a grave violation"" and stresses that the independence and secession of a territory may be achieved only through a lawful and peaceful process and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to the expulsion of part of the region's population. It calls for compliance with four UN Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993 calling for the withdrawal of unnamed occupying forces from districts of Azerbaijan bordering on Nagorno-Karabakh. And it calls on the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group to expedite a formal agreement on cessation of the conflict that would ""eliminate the major consequences of the conflict for all parties"" and pave the way for the so-called Minsk Conference that would address the region's future status vis-a-vis Azerbaijan.That approach is tantamount to endorsement of the so-called ""phased"" approach to resolving the conflict, and it would apparently require the withdrawal of Karabakh Armenian forces from the seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on Nagorno-Karabakh that they currently control, and the return to their abandoned homes of the region's Azerbaijani minority, prior to the beginning of any formal discussion of the region's political status and of the measure of self-rule to which it would be entitled as part of Azerbaijan. The Armenian government considers this approach anathema, insofar as it would deprive the Armenian side of its sole bargaining chip (the occupied territories) before talks on Karabakh's status got under way.The final version of the report terms the occupation of the territory of one Council of Europe member state by another ""a grave violation.""Azerbaijani commentators on 26 January termed the final wording of the report a major defeat for Armenia. But the report also contained at least one recommendation that is not acceptable to Azerbaijan: the Armenian delegation succeeded in having it amended to include a call on the Azerbaijani leadership to embark immediately and unconditionally on talks with the leadership of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic on the region's future status. Moreover, addressing the Assembly on 25 January, Atkinson argued that Azerbaijan should be expelled from the Council of Europe if it attempts to restore its hegemony over Nagorno-Karabakh by military means, Turan reported. Atkinson reminded PACE that he visited Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s, and added that he ""will never forget"" the Azerbaijani bombing of Stepanakert.",,,

But they face an immediate challenge in Sudan's Darfur region, where UN experts have raised alarm about atrocities and the mass abuse of human rights for more than a year. An international commission is due to report today on whether or not genocide is occurring in Darfur. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a speech about Auschwitz, called on the UN Security Council to be ready to respond to the commission's findings. United Nations, 25 January 2005 (RFE/RL) -- ""Never again"" was the refrain at a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly session commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz.But speakers at the session expressed dismay at the world's failure to stop the genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, and the Balkans during the last quarter of the 20th century.UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also used the assembly's first-ever commemoration of the Holocaust to remind countries of the current humanitarian disaster in Sudan's western Darfur region. Annan said an international commission of inquiry, requested by the UN Security Council, is due to report to him today on the extent of the abuses. He urged the Security Council to be prepared to act.""That report will determine whether or not acts of genocide have occurred in Darfur. But also, and no less important, it will identify the gross violations of international humanitarian law and human rights which undoubtedly have occurred,"" Annan said.Darfur has been embroiled in violence for nearly two years, after two rebel groups began an armed resistance against the government in a clash over resources.Since then, Arab militias known as Janjaweed have retaliated by rampaging through the area. Tens of thousands of civilians have died and nearly 2 million have been displaced since the fighting began. The Sudanese government denies links to the Janjaweed, but there have been numerous reports that the militia is equipped by Khartoum.The UN Security Council is divided over a course of action to bring an end to the abuses. There is a growing debate over whether it should refer cases of major abusers to the new International Criminal Court, which the United States strongly opposes.French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier told reporters at UN headquarters today that ""terrible things"" have been done to Darfur's civilians. But he stressed that any solution should involve engagement with the Sudanese government. ""It's my conviction that we won't solve this dramatic situation without the Sudan or against the Sudan but with the Sudan, and that is the aim of the mediating efforts that have been carried out in the United Nations and particularly by the African Union,"" Barnier said.Aside from the UN secretary-general, few speakers mentioned the Darfur tragedy by name during the Auschwitz session. But Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian made a strong appeal to the international community to do more to track down the perpetrators of atrocities in Darfur. ""Recognizing the victims and acknowledging them is also to recognize that there are perpetrators, but this is absolutely not the same as to name them, shame them, to dissuade them, to isolate them and to punish them,"" he said.Oskanian said that, based on its own experience, Armenia has a special understanding of the trauma caused by genocide and international indifference. Armenia says 1.5 million ethnic Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1923 in a genocidal campaign. Turkey denies genocide occurred.",,,

The resolution criticizes ethnic Armenian forces for occupying considerable parts of Azerbaijan's territory years after the end of the separatist conflict. The document also states that the 1988-94 war led to large-scale ethnic expulsions and the creation of mono-ethnic areas that it says ""resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing."" The vote came amid protests from the Armenian delegation, which described the draft resolution and its appending report as biased in Azerbaijan's favor. Prague, 25 January 2005 (RFE/RL) -- For more than two hours, Armenian and Azerbaijani delegates to the PACE crossed swords over who should claim historical rights over the Nagorno-Karabakh separatist region.But British parliamentarian David Atkinson, who drafted the recommendation on behalf of the Strasbourg-based assembly's political affairs committee, urged his South Caucasus colleagues not to engage in sterile discussions.""We cannot go down this route,"" Atkinson said. ""Those who hark back to history are condemned to live in the past. We have to move forward. We must recognize the realities of today.""In Atkinson's words, the ""realities of today"" are that -- 11 years after the 1994 truce that formally ended the Karabakh war -- Azerbaijan remains technically at war with its secessionist region.A predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave of Soviet Azerbaijan, Karabakh seceded in 1988 with Yerevan's help. Armenian forces gradually took control of the mountainous region before seizing a number of adjacent Azerbaijani administrative districts, which they continue to occupy.The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.The conflict has claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.Atkinson especially drew the assembly's attention to the plight of those civilians who, despite the end of the war, were still denied the right to return to their home regions.""I was the [PACE] assembly's first rapporteur on the refugee situation, when my report described the temporary shelters in both Armenia and Azerbaijan, [including] dilapidated railway trucks outside [the Armenian capital of] Yerevan, and appalling tent cities outside [the Azerbaijani capital of] Baku, housing hundreds of thousands of displaced families,"" Atkinson said. ""Since then, a time-bomb generation of young refugees has grown up, as in Palestine, with nothing much to lose.""The Armenian government was able to take care of nearly all of the refugees from Azerbaijan. By contrast, an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Karabakh and Azerbaijan continue to live in makeshift camps, abandoned railway cars and dugouts near Baku and other Azerbaijani cities and towns.International aid agencies believe up to one-third of children of Azerbaijani IDPs suffer from malnutrition.When Armenia and Azerbaijan joined the Council of Europe in January 2001, they both committed to seek a quick solution to their dispute. But no breakthrough has been reached, despite the mediation extended by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe through a small gathering of nations co-chaired by France, Russia, and the United States -- known as the Minsk Group.Azerbaijan has demanded that all ethnic Armenian forces withdraw from its territory as a prerequisite to any discussion on the status of its secessionist enclave. Armenia, which represents Karabakh in the peace talks, has opposed Baku's ""step-by-step"" approach and insisted the fate of the breakaway region be settled simultaneously with all other issues.Ignoring protests raised by Armenia's representatives, the majority of PACE delegates today supported a demand made by Bulgarian parliamentarian Evgeni Kirilov that Azerbaijan be free of any occupying troops.""We should be clear once and for all, and I think we are all behind this idea -- there cannot be territories occupied by force, or there cannot be any prospect of joining any territories by force to [any] country,"" Kirilov said. ""If we agree on this, then we can build a way for a lasting peace.""The resolution adopted today calls on Azerbaijani authorities to establish contacts with Karabakh leaders -- which they have persistently refused to do -- and to refrain from any attempts to retake lost territory by force. Nevertheless, some Armenian delegates have blamed Atkinson for the resolution's alleged bias.This was notably the case of Armen Rustamian, the deputy chair of the Armenian delegation and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, a nationalist political grouping also known as Dashnaktsutyun. Addressing the Assembly in French, Rustamian said he believes Atkinson's resolution would not only hinder the peace process, but will also would serve as an incentive for Azerbaijan to forcefully restore its territorial integrity.""Azerbaijan is expecting to use this document as a justification to issue an ultimatum it has been preparing for a long time,"" Rustamian said. ""Azerbaijan wants to solve the [Karabakh] issue according to its own scenario -- that is, through war.""Of all non-Armenian delegates who attended today's debate, only French parliamentarian Francois Rochebloine publicly questioned the impartiality of Atkinson's report.""It seems to me that, for the sake of objectivity, this report should have given a more balanced view of the position of the Armenian side and its readiness to negotiate,"" Rochebloine said.Of particular concern to Armenia's representatives is a sentence in the resolution that refers to the ""large-scale ethnic expulsions"" that resulted from the Karabakh conflict and ""the creation of mono-ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing.""Although the document does not explicitly mention the massive exodus of Azerbaijani civilians during the years 1993 and 1994, some Armenian diaspora groupings have protested the wording of the resolution.In a statement released on 23 January, the Brussels-based European Armenian Federation for Justice and Democracy -- formerly known as the Armenian National Committee of Europe -- described the draft document as ""the report of Azerbaijan."" It also called on European citizens to act through their Strasbourg-based representatives so that the text would be either withdrawn or rejected.The Armenian government has so far not reacted to the Atkinson report.Media reports quoted Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian as saying Yerevan would make its position public only after the document was voted upon.",,,

In line with that agreement, neither Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian nor his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov have divulged any details of their most recent talks in Prague on 10-11 January. But four days after those talks, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a press release (http://www.In.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/sps/817A437F6E4B727BC3256F89004AE499) listing specific issues under discussion, adding that on some of those issues the two sides' positions have become closer.Speaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service after meeting with Mammadyarov on 11 January, Oskanian characterized the mood of the talks as ""positive."" He said that ""full agreement"" has not yet been reached on the principles of a settlement, but that ""there is a general framework of issues, but as this meeting showed, they need to be consolidated."" He added that ""it is still too early to disclose any details."" Briefing journalists in Yerevan the following day, Oskanian predicted that settlement talks this year will be ""quite intensive,"" thus marking a qualitative shift to a new, more serious phase of discussions. Noyan Tapan quoted him as saying that ""all elements"" related to a peaceful solution of the conflict are on the table, without listing those elements.Oskanian further noted that Azerbaijani media frequently misrepresent the nature and focus of the talks, and that ""everyone"" -- presumably meaning both Mammadyarov and the U.S., Russian, and French co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group -- agree that ""officials should be more circumspect when making statements.""On 13 January, Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov similarly briefed journalists in Baku on the Prague talks. Azimov said that while Baku insists that any solution to the conflict must preserve Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, the restoration of territorial integrity alone will not solve all problems: in that context he mentioned specifically the future peaceful coexistence of the Armenian population of Karabakh and those Azerbaijanis who fled the region over a decade ago when the conflict first turned violent and hope to return there.Azimov also listed issues that could form part of a hypothetical solution to the conflict. He said that if Armenian troops are withdrawn from Azerbaijani territory, Azerbaijan would be ready to restore economic and other relations with Armenia. He was quoted by zerkalo.az as saying that ""a little later, the question of the return to the region of the Azerbaijani population and the coexistence of the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in Nagorno-Karabakh must be addressed. Once interregional ties and ties between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia [on the one hand] and the government of Azerbaijan are established, it will be possible to achieve a normalization of the situation and set about seeking a solution to other political questions."" Whether Oskanian and Mammadyarov have discussed that specific sequence of events is not clear, however.Azimov dismissed as ""speculation"" reports that the liberation of three of the seven districts of Azerbaijan currently under Armenian control is under discussion: he said that ""in the course of the Prague process the question of liberating all seven districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh at the first stage is being discussed."" According to echo-az.com, Azimov likewise denied that the possibility of holding a referendum in Nagorno-Karabakh on the region's future status was addressed in Prague, and he expressed regret that such ""unreliable information"" finds its way into the press. In an article published in ""Le Figaro"" last month, former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio and Pierre Lellouche, who is NATO Parliamentary Assembly president, argued that the Karabakh conflict differs fundamentally from those in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transdniester, and that ""the Europeans, Americans, and Russians should jointly defend a compromise [settlement] that would give Armenia temporary control of Karabakh in exchange for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territory, [with] the final status of Karabakh to be decided by its inhabitants in a referendum in five or 10 years' time.""The Russian Foreign Ministry press release listed among the ""contentious issues"" under discussion: the withdrawal of [Armenian] troops, demilitarization of the previously occupied territories, international security guarantees for the Armenian population of Karabakh, and the unrecognized republic's future status vis-a-vis Azerbaijan. The press release reaffirmed Moscow's readiness to contribute, together with the other two Minsk Group co-chairs, to ""deepening the mutual understanding between Armenia and Azerbaijan"" with a view to bringing about a peaceful solution to the conflict.",,,

Officially, the discussions achieved no breakthroughs, but both men agreed to meet again in the near future. In an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Oskanian said a lot remains to be done before both sides can agree on the basic principles of a peace settlement. Prague, 12 January 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan met for three hours in Prague in a bid to move the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process forward.The discussions took place behind closed doors. Both ministers also met separately with representatives of the Minsk Group of nations -- France, Russia, and the United States -- mandated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to mediate in the conflict. OSCE Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk also attended the talks.The main result achieved this week in Prague is that both ministers agreed to meet again in the coming weeks.The Karabakh conflict dates back to 1988, when the predominantly Armenian enclave seceded from Soviet Azerbaijan. The move triggered a six-year war that claimed thousands of lives and drove an estimated 800,000 Azerbaijanis from their homes. Both sides signed a cease-fire agreement in 1994 but remain technically at war.As a prerequisite to any peace deal, Azerbaijan demands that Armenian troops withdraw from the adjacent territories they have been occupying since 1993, thus paving the way for the return of displaced populations. Only once this is achieved, Baku says, can the status of Karabakh be discussed. Addressing reporters on the sidelines of yesterday's Prague meeting, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov reiterated that his country will not compromise on the issue: ""Our main objective is to achieve a result. Such a result must be that Armenian forces withdraw from the occupied territories and that refugees return home. This is our fundamental approach. What we are discussing here is how to possibly achieve that result.""Yesterday's meeting was the fifth held by Mammadyarov and Oskanian in the Czech capital in the framework of what is known as the ""Prague process.""As in previous cases, neither envoy divulged details of the discussions. Azerbaijan's pro-government ""525-ci Qazet"" newspaper said today that the main result achieved this week in Prague is that both ministers agreed to meet again in the coming weeks. More optimistically, Azerbaijan's ""Zerkalo"" (Mirror), a Russian-language daily, reports both sides agreed on the fundamental principles of a peace settlement and are now ready to examine ""concrete issues and details."" But in an interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service yesterday, Oskanian said the basic principles of a peace agreement remain to be worked out: ""I wish I could say that there is a full agreement on the principles. But we are still not there. There is a general framework of issues [to be discussed] but, as this [last] meeting showed, they need to be further consolidated.""Citing recent remarks attributed to Yuri Merzlyakov, Russia's envoy to the Minsk Group, Azerbaijani and Armenian media have been speculating that Armenia might soon drop its demands for a so-called ""package"" solution to the conflict -- that is, stop insisting that the liberation of Azerbaijani territories and the political status of Karabakh be negotiated simultaneously.Oskanian flatly denied those claims yesterday. However, he said the peace process has become so intricate that, in his view, there is no longer a clear distinction between Armenia's ""package"" and Azerbaijan's ""step-by-step"" approach: ""The 'Prague process' is fairly difficult and complex, and it will remain such at further meetings. On the whole, I consider the overall mood and atmosphere [of the talks] as positive. It is still too early to disclose any details. But once we achieve concrete results on specific issues, we will release them gradually.""The Baku-based Turan news agency yesterday quoted Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Metin Mirza as saying the Minsk Group had discussed with both envoys the possibility of sending a fact-finding mission to Karabakh and Azerbaijan's Armenian-held territories.In the meantime, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe will discuss a draft resolution on the Karabakh conflict later this month (25 January).In it, the Strasbourg-based assembly urges country members Armenia and Azerbaijan to foster political reconciliation. It also calls on Yerevan to comply with past UN resolutions calling for the liberation of all occupied territories of Azerbaijan and reaffirms the right of displaced populations to return to their homes ""safely and with dignity.""",,,0

Barnier said yesterday that Turkey must come to terms with the mass killing of Armenians in the late years of the Ottoman Empire before it can enter the EU. The remarks have already provoked reactions in Turkey. Ankara has long denied charges that Turks committed genocide against Armenians. Prague, 14 December 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The comments by French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier came after talks in Brussels with his counterparts from the 24 other European Union countries. Barnier told reporters that France wants Ankara to reconsider its position on the mass killings of Ottoman Armenians at the start of the last century before it joins the EU.""Regarding Armenia, I mentioned the request that France will make during the negotiations [with Turkey] for a recognition of the tragedy that took place at the beginning of the [last] century and that concerned hundreds of thousands of Armenians,"" Barnier said.It was the first time a French government official publicly established a link between the Armenian atrocities and Turkey's EU aspirations.Barnier said France would file an official request with the Turkish government after the EU gives Ankara a date for the start of formal entry talks.Ankara's membership bid will be reviewed at the EU's winter summit on 16 and 17 December in Brussels. The bloc has already made it clear that it will give positive answers.""This is an issue that we will raise during the negotiation process. We will have about 10 years to do so and the Turks will have about 10 years to ponder their answer."" -- French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier According to most Western estimates, massacres and deportations between 1915 and 1923 claimed up to 1.5 million Armenian lives. Another 200,000 Armenians reportedly were killed between 1894 and 1896.Most Western and Armenian scholars blame the nationalist Young Turk leaders that ruled over the Ottoman Empire during World War I for a deliberate policy of extermination.Although the successive governments that came to power after the creation of the Turkish Republic in 1923 deny any links with their Ottoman predecessors, they have always refused to recognize the killings of Armenians as genocide. Ankara insists the 1.5-million death toll is inflated and says that, if 300,000 Armenians did die during those years, this was largely the result of civil unrest that also claimed the lives of thousands of Turks. Citing historical evidence, Western and Armenian scholars in turn say the Young Turks sought to systematically deport and massacre the empire's Armenian population, partly in retaliation for its suspected collaboration with Russia.Since 1923, Turkey has resisted and condemned any attempt by foreign parliaments or governments to raise the Armenian genocide issue.In June 2001, the French parliament passed a cautiously worded bill that recognized the 1915-1923 killings of Ottoman Armenians as genocide. Although the French government opposed the initiative, President Jacques Chirac signed the bill into law. This prompted a swift reaction from Ankara, which threatened to sever economic and cultural ties with Paris.Turkey's anger eventually abated after a few weeks and bilateral relations went back to normal.Up until a parliamentary debate today, Barnier was careful to not describe the 1915-1923 killings as ""genocide."" Still, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman immediately reacted to his initial comments, saying his country would ""never recognize any so-called genocide."" Armenia, which has put recognition of the genocide worldwide on its foreign policy agenda, welcomed France's position.Speaking to reporters in Yerevan today, Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said that Barnier's remarks in Brussels ""show once again that the question of the genocide has gone beyond the Armenian framework and is now a global issue.""In an interview with Reuters last week, Oskanian said he hoped Turkey would change its stance on the genocide after it enters into talks with the EU.Regional experts say Ankara's attitude toward the Armenian issue is deeply rooted in Turkeys' educational system, which glosses over the country's cultural diversity in a bid to promote a unifying Turkish national identity.However, Barnier said that in France's view, Ankara cannot aspire to EU membership if it refuses to come in terms with its past.""If, as I think, the core idea of Europe's project is that all its members should reconcile one with another -- like France and Germany, which have put reconciliation at the center of their project -- and that each member state should reconcile with its own past, then I believe that when the time comes Turkey, too, will have to come in terms with its own past and history and recognize this tragedy,"" Barnier said.In comments on France 2 public television today, the foreign minister reiterated that Paris is not making this a condition for the opening of entry talks with the EU. Barnier said that would not be legally possible.""This is an issue that we will raise during the negotiation process. We will have about 10 years to do so and the Turks will have about 10 years to ponder their answer. It is not a condition we're making for the opening of negotiations that will be discussed by EU leaders this coming Thursday and Friday,"" Barnier said.Results of an opinion survey released today by the Paris-based French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) show a majority of citizens in France and Germany remain opposed to Turkey's entry into the EU. Those who object to Ankara's accession cite its human rights record, its cultural and religious differences with European countries, and the status of women in Turkish society.However, they make no mention of the Armenian issue.",,,

Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov told the assembly that thousands of ethnic Armenians have resettled in Azerbaijani districts near the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. But Armenia's UN ambassador denied any such activities. He told the assembly that the bid for a UN resolution could undermine an ongoing process directed by the OSCE. United Nations, 24 November 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Azerbaijan has urged support for a UN General Assembly resolution that calls attention to the situation in territories captured by ethnic Armenian forces a decade ago.Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov told the assembly yesterday that Baku was seeking UN engagement because he said basic UN humanitarian principles were at stake.Mammadyarov said his government had become alarmed by reports of settlement activities that could threaten the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced Azerbaijanis to their homes in districts near Nagorno-Karabakh.But he also stressed the primacy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in mediating peace talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia.""We do not attempt to engage the General Assembly into consideration of the conflict resolution issues,"" Mammadyarov said. ""The matter is about the problem, which impedes the process of peace negotiations and, if continued, could lead to a humanitarian disaster.""The foreign minister said his country had gathered credible information about a settlement policy promoted by the Armenian government in Azerbaijani districts adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh. They include Lachin, Kelbadjar, Zangilan, and Jabrail.Armenia's UN ambassador, Armen Martirosyan, denied any such policy. But he did say that in order to address the charges, Armenia had decided to facilitate a fact-finding team within the OSCE to assess the situation in the territories. That is one of the requests contained in the Azerbaijani resolution.Azerbaijan's foreign minister said his government had become alarmed by reports of settlement activities that could threaten the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced Azerbaijanis to their homes in districts near Nagorno-Karabakh.He said Azerbaijan was trying to decouple the issue of the captured territories from the whole group of issues discussed under the aegis of the OSCE's Minsk Group. A fundamental part of those talks, he said, is the quest for self-determination by the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians.Martirosyan said the territories are serving as a security belt around Nagorno-Karabakh as a response to what he called the ""war-mongering rhetoric"" of the Azerbaijani leadership.""The issue of those territories cannot be resolved unless there is a resolution on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and security guarantees are provided,"" Martirosyan said.Turkey's UN ambassador spoke in favor of the draft resolution, calling it a ""cry out of frustration"" by Azerbaijani officials.But U.S. representative Susan Moore, speaking on behalf of the Minsk Group, said the Minsk process is the best forum for resolving the dispute. She said efforts should be focused on building confidence between the two sides and avoiding divisions in the General Assembly.""Azerbaijan is raising specific concerns linked to the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" Moore said. ""We believe these concerns can be fully addressed in the existing format. As a first step an OSCE fact-finding mission could be considered as a means to address this issue.""The assembly chair said the chamber would continue discussions on the resolution at an unspecified later date.",,,

The resolution, to be discussed today (eds: 1600 Prague time), calls for reaffirming Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and seeks an investigation into Azerbaijani claims Armenia is promoting a settlement policy in the occupied lands. Armenia denies this and has said such a resolution could undermine the peace process. United Nations, 23 November 2004 (RFE/RL) - The UN General Assembly was expected to open discussion today on a resolution seeking to address Azerbaijan's concerns about its occupied territories and sluggish peace process with Armenia.The resolution calls for a reaffirmation of Azerbaijan's sovereignty and territorial integrity 10 years after ethnic Armenian forces won control over Nagorno-Karabakh and occupied several districts adjacent to the enclave.It expresses ""alarm and grave concern"" at the situation in the area occupied by Armenian forces, alleging the violation of international humanitarian laws. The measure also raises concern about reports of Armenian settlers being transferred to the territories.Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov told reporters yesterday that the persistence of such reports, from international and Armenian sources, was a main factor driving the initiative in the assembly.The resolution invites the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is directing peace talks, to send a fact-finding mission to lands occupied by ethnic Armenian forces to report on the situation.""We get greatly concerned that the Armenian government is conducting a settlers' policy in the occupied territories, which we consider as a pure violation of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva conventions of 1949,"" Mammadyarov said.The resolution invites the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is directing peace talks, to send a fact-finding mission to lands occupied by ethnic Armenian forces to report on the situation.Diplomats at Armenia's UN mission did not respond to repeated requests for comment yesterday. When the issue was placed on the assembly's agenda in October, Armenian officials said there were no settlements in the territories outside the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and denied there was any policy to settle those lands. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian recently warned that Azerbaijan's initiative in the assembly threatened to undermine mediation efforts under the OSCE's Minsk Group. A French diplomat speaking on behalf of the group told the General Assembly in October that the group did not believe UN was the proper forum to discuss the matter.Mammadyarov said yesterday that his government remained committed to the Minsk process but was looking to spur progress on issues related to its large number of displaced persons. The resolution, though nonbinding, would seek to expand international pressure for a solution.""We do not agree that [the resolution] can create bad consequences for the peace process,"" Mammadyarov said. ""We consider that even it will support the peace process because otherwise you cannot conduct sincere peace negotiations, and simultaneously behind the scenes [the] Armenian side [is] conducting negotiations providing the so-called settlement process.""The initiative follows strong comments by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev at the General Assembly debate in September. Aliyev faulted the UN for neglecting the situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, citing UN Security Council resolutions in 1993 that called for the withdrawal of ethnic Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territory.Mammadyarov said he also wants to see countries in the Minsk Group, especially the United States, become more active in pressing for a negotiated solution to the conflict.""The conflict is very, very difficult. Of course, the settlement of the conflict is not very easy,"" Mammadyarov said. ""What we're calling [for] is that it should be solved only by the efforts of [the whole] international community.""The war over Nagorno-Karabakh has driven an estimated 800,000 Azerbaijanis from their homes, about a tenth of the country's population. Azerbaijan's internally displaced people cannot return to Armenian-occupied territories, and many have been living in wretched conditions for the past 10 years.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1055807.html,Analysis Azerbaijan Rejects Armenian Warning Over Karabakh Talks ,"November 10, 2004 16:57 GMT",,,"In an exclusive interview on 9 November with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that he and his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov made ""serious progress"" during their four rounds of talks on approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict. Oskanian said it is now possible to begin a second stage of talks building on what was achieved earlier, and that Azerbaijan has signaled its readiness for such talks. ""Armenia has already given its positive answer and is ready to resume the negotiations [as early as] tomorrow,"" Oskanian said. Since May, Oskanian and Mammadyarov have met four times in Strasbourg and Prague to discuss approaches to resolving the conflict. Whatever provisional consensus they reached was the subject of discussion at a meeting on 15 September between the two countries' presidents, Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, on the sidelines of a CIS summit in Astana, after which Oskanian said there would be an ""interval"" before the second stage of his talks with Mammadyarov began. Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov said in late September that the past meetings with Oskanian had proved ""useful"" but that further such talks had been postponed ""indefinitely"" at Armenia's request. No details have been divulged of the issues on the table in Prague, and that enforced confidentiality has spawned rumors that Yerevan is prepared to withdraw from either three or five of the seven occupied Azerbaijani districts bordering on Karabakh even before a final decision is reached on the future political status of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.On 27 October, the Armenian Foreign Ministry issued a formal statement denying such speculation. ""Regardless of Azerbaijan's wishes or statements, Armenia's focus during negotiations is on the issue of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. All other issues are tangential to the status issue, and Armenia views them only in the context of the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" the statement said. It further underscored that Yerevan ""is interested only in a comprehensive resolution of this issue, and its participation in negotiations is conditional on that approach,"" the statement continued. In other words, Armenia wants the final agreement on a solution to the conflict to address, and stipulate a solution to, all disputed issues, and to specify the order and time frame in which the various points agreed upon will be implemented.Also in his 9 November interview with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Oskanian criticized as ""a diplomatic error"" Baku's insistence on including on the agenda of the UN General Assembly the issue of the resettlement of Armenian families on territory controlled by Armenian forces. He warned that Azerbaijan should not proceed on the assumption that it can continue negotiations on resolving the Karabakh conflict under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group while at the same time seeking the assistance of other international organizations in resolving individual issues related to that conflict. Armenia wants the final agreement on a solution to the conflict to address, and stipulate a solution to, all disputed issues, and to specify the order and time frame in which the various points agreed upon will be implemented.""Either we continue the negotiations within the Minsk Group, trying to reach a solution of the whole problem, or Azerbaijan can take the issue to other instances, seeking separate solutions,"" Oskanian said. Should Azerbaijan choose the latter approach, Oskanian said, the Azerbaijani authorities will have to negotiate with the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. ""Today the ball is in [Azerbaijan's] court,"" Oskanian concluded. But on 10 November Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Metin Mirza rejected Oskanian's warning that Azerbaijan should not try to launch a parallel mediation effort as an effort to ""torpedo"" the negotiating process at a juncture when ""favorable conditions"" had been created for making progress. He inferred that Yerevan is ""seriously concerned"" by the prospect of the UN General Assembly debate. And he stressed yet again that Baku will not agree to negotiate with the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. President Aliyev similarly argued last week that raising the Karabakh issue in other international forums will not jeopardize the ongoing search for a solution under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk Group, nor does Baku seek to replace the Minsk Group by another mediator, ITAR-TASS reported. Aliyev said Baku simply wants international organizations such as the UN, the EU, and the Council of Europe to ""recognize unequivocally that Armenia has occupied part of Azerbaijan's territory,"" and that this ""unfair situation"" should be corrected. Touring four southern regions of Azerbaijan on 9 November, President Aliyev said that Baku will not sign a formal Karabakh peace agreement until Armenian forces have retreated from the districts adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh that they currently occupy, ITAR-TASS reported. ""We demand with justification that the seized territory be freed and the occupying forces withdraw,"" Aliyev said while visiting Astara, where he formally opened a new cargo terminal on the border with Iran.",,,

Bush congratulating him on his reelection to a second term as U.S. president, chechenpress.info reported on 5 November. Maskhadov characterizes the United States as a country that embodies for all mankind the principles of democracy and human rights. He said that in their unequal struggle, the Chechen people derive inspiration from the values proclaimed by the U.S. founding fathers. He hailed President Bush personally as embodying ""the lofty principles that are fundamental for all those who battle against tyranny."" In a commentary on chechenpress.info, Maskhadov's envoy Akhmed Zakaev explained that while many Chechens may consider Maskhadov's words of congratulation misplaced in light of Bush's proclaimed support for what Zakaev termed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""criminal regime,"" Maskhadov was in fact hailing Bush not as an individual political figure, but as the head of a state founded on principles that are dear to all Chechens. ""The fact that Bush has retreated from those principles does not detract from the significance of America as a symbol of the struggle for the freedom of oppressed peoples,"" Zakaev argued. ""In expressing respect for the U.S. principles of freedom and democracy, we are simply stressing to what degree the current U.S. administration has retreated from those principles by upholding the Kremlin's regime of tyranny,"" Zakaev concluded. The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan have both written to President Bush to congratulate him on his reelection.

Kocharian also expressed gratitude for Armenia's inclusion in the U.S. Millennium Challenge program and for Washington's ""active involvement"" in efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The radical Armenian opposition party Hanrapetutiun released a statement in Yerevan on 4 November congratulating Bush, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. The statement expressed confidence that the Bush administration will ""bring the ongoing fight against international terrorism to its logical conclusion."" It also expressed the hope that U.S. efforts to ensure lasting peace in the South Caucasus and to promote democratization in Armenia will prove successful. That latter remark reflects Hanrapetutiun's bitterness over last year's less-than-wholly-democratic presidential and parliamentary elections and subsequent reprisals against the Armenian opposition.Also on 4 November, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev wrote to Bush saying he is confident that Bush's efforts to restore peace to the planet will continue, and stressing the importance Baku attaches to continued cooperation with the United States, zerkalo.az reported, citing Turan.

Groong quoted Baramidze's Armenian counterpart Serzh Sarkisian as having told the first channel of Armenian radio on 3 November that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is ""not that important"" for Yerevan. ""I think that our relations will develop and deepen, especially in the military sphere,"" he said. ""Once again I would like to reiterate that the relations between the U.S. and Armenia in the military sphere will not depend on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election."" Sarkisian, together with a number of other Armenian politicians, was invited to the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan to watch ongoing coverage of the vote count.Most Armenians, however, both in Armenia and the United States, favored Democratic challenger John Kerry in light of his repeated pledges to recognize as genocide the killings of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915. In Azerbaijan, President Ilham Aliyev told journalists on 3 November, before the final outcome of the ballot was known, that the United States ""is a strategic partner of Azerbaijan,"" and that Baku considers the development of relations with Washington in various spheres important. He stressed especially the ""outstanding cooperation"" in the oil and gas sphere. Aliyev said he will send a letter of congratulation to the new president.But the independent daily ""Zerkalo"" made the point in a commentary published on the eve of the U.S. ballot that Washington's policy towards Azerbaijan might change fundamentally in the event of a Democratic victory, given Senator Kerry's pro-Armenian sympathies. It suggested that a Kerry administration would be more critical of Azerbaijan's human rights record and of perceived election violations. By contrast, a second term for incumbent President George W. Bush could offer Azerbaijan the opportunity to resolve the Karabakh conflict on favorable terms, the paper predicted.Azerbaijan's second independent Russian-language daily, ""Ekho,"" chose to focus not on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election but the voting procedure. ""Ekho"" on 4 November quoted two Danish Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe election observers who noted procedural violations and complained of not being admitted to some election precincts.

The law was passed in July, but at least 13 conscientious objectors remain in jail in Armenia, including five jailed just this month. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has questioned the country's actions, as have other civil rights organizations. Prague, 22 October 2004 -- Different government officials offer divergent statements about the treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses in Armenia.According to deputy speaker of parliament Tigran Torosyan, there are no members of the Christian denomination in jail for resisting military service as conscientious objectors. Torosyan told RFE/RL yesterday, ""I don't know examples of people belonging to this organization who are in jail.""The Forum 18 news service -- which covers religious freedom in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe -- reported that, in fact, five Jehovah's Witnesses have been jailed this month alone for refusing military service. That brings to 13 the number serving prison time for the offense. The maximum sentence for such an offense in Armenia is two years.In yet another statement, Torosyan said those conscientious objectors in jail in Armenia would be freed when a new law on alternatives to military service was passed. He made the comment to Jehovah's Witnesses representatives at a meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe last June. The law passed on 1 July. Yet the conscientious objectors remain in jail.Despite parliament adopting a law on alternative service, the government has not made any provision for such service. A lawyer for the Jehovah's Witnesses, Rustam Khachatryan, said that is what Defense Ministry officials told his clients individually before they were prosecuted and jailed.Officials have also said Jehovah's Witnesses cannot be recognized as conscientious objectors until the denomination achieves official registration as a religious organization.But Paul S. Gillies, a spokesman for the group, points out that authorities finally registered the church on 11 October. The group had sought this status for nine years. ""One of the explanations [for denying conscientious objectors' rights] that was given to me personally was that they were waiting for registration. Because we were unregistered, then they couldn't release the prisoners. But then one of the obstacles to registration was always said to be the fact that we were conscientious objectors,"" Gillies told RFE/RL. ""I get the feeling that no government department particularly wants to do this --- to [implement] an alternative-service law.""Forum 18 says that Vladimir Karapetian of the ministry's Media Relations Division said on 19 October that the issue is outside the competence of the Foreign Ministry. Natalia Voutova, a Council of Europe representative in Yerevan, said the Foreign Ministry declined to explain how keeping a promise the country made to the council in 2001 could be construed as outside the competence of the ministry.Forum 18 editor Felix Corley told RFE/RL that he does not believe all of these contradictions indicate that Armenia's bureaucracy is incompetent. ""No. I get the feeling that no government department particularly wants to do this --- to [implement] an alternative-service law."" he said. ""They know perfectly well what they are doing. The Foreign Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the representatives to the Council of Europe -- they all know perfectly well what the commitments are. They all know perfectly well what the current situation is. They just don't want to. They fear political and social pressure.""Corley said the Jehovah's Witnesses -- which says it has 8,000 members in Armenia -- is probably the most unpopular religious group in Armenia, where normalcy means membership -- however casual -- in the Armenian Apostolic Church.In a country troubled by tense relations with neighboring Azerbaijan, refusal of military service is disliked. Also, the group aggressively seeks to recruit new converts, an activity that offends many in the country.Jehovah's Witnesses has its headquarters in New York and claims 6 million members around the world.

The agency's decision is likely to make life much harder for the tens of thousands of civilians in the country who depend heavily on such foreign aid. But the WFP's assistance to displaced persons in the country is just one aspect of the problem. Thousands of others -- refugees from recent wars in the Caucasus and elsewhere -- are also living in Azerbaijan, and in even worse conditions. Prague, 15 October 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has decided to reduce food rations for tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Azerbaijan.The agency says it is still looking for almost half of the money it needs to finance a three-year operation that started in January 2003. Donations collected so far from the United States, Japan, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland amount to only $11 million.Rahman Chowdhury, who is the WFP's country director in Azerbaijan, told RFE/RL that both financial constraints and a shortage of food supplies are responsible for the decision to cut assistance to Azerbaijan's IDPs. ""We have not received enough food during the last couple of months, and our in-country stocks of food commodities are such that we cannot provide rations to all the IDPs that we are assisting now,"" he said. ""So we decided that we would halve the rations of wheat flour and that rations for other commodities -- such as sugar and oil -- would remain as [they are].""Up until now, WFP food rations amounted to 6 kilograms per person per month.There has been no official reaction from Baku. In private, however, government officials lament the WFP's decision, saying the UN program should continue running in full until all IDPs are able to return home.Azerbaijan witnessed the largest forced migrations that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union.First came thousands of Azeri refugees from Armenia, as tensions between Yerevan and Baku flared up in the late 1980s. Later, after Armenian separatists took control of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, tens of thousands of Azeris were forced to move into areas controlled by Baku. Joined by tens of thousands more Azeris, Kurds, and others, they were later forced farther into exile as Armenian troops pushed east, progressively occupying Azerbaijani territories bordering Karabakh. As the Russian Army gradually broadened its operations to reassert Moscow's control over Chechnya, thousands more civilians fled the breakaway republic through Daghestan and sought refuge in Azerbaijan.Baku-based nongovernmental organizations believe the Karabakh war has driven an estimated 800,000 people into exile -- roughly one-10th of Azerbaijan's current population. In addition, they say some 70,000 refugees from Chechnya, Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq have found shelter in the country in recent years. The Karabakh conflict was suspended in 1994. Yet Azerbaijan's IDPs cannot return to Armenian-occupied territories and have been living in the same wretched conditions for the past 10 years. The $10 monthly stipend they receive from the government does little to improve their situation.In the makeshift camps that surround the central towns of Saatli and Sabirabad, families are crammed into one-room, mud-brick huts. Elsewhere, people live in abandoned railway wagons and dugouts. About one-third of children of IDPs reportedly suffer from malnutrition. Chowdhury said the WFP's decision to halve food rations may have serious implications. ""The consequences are quite tough because the winter is coming and that will aggravate their hardships in the coming months,"" he said. ""We are aware of this, but because we don't have enough food commodities and because we didn't get enough contributions from our donor countries in the last three months, we had to resort to this [measure].""The UN food agency is only assisting 145,000 IDPs it considers most in need, and is not dealing with Azerbaijan's refugees. Vusal Rajabli is president of Hayat (Life), a Baku-based NGO that provides humanitarian aid to refugees and IDPs across Azerbaijan. He said refugees are much more vulnerable than IDPs because, unlike the latter, they depend almost exclusively on foreign aid. ""Unfortunately, the assistance the government offers refugees is scarce -- I would even say it is extremely small. It covers only 5 to 10 percent of their needs. The government says it has just enough resources to take care of its internal refugees. Therefore, all the government can afford goes to IDPs. This makes the situation of refugees much, much worse. Refugees are taken care of by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and our organization in partnership. The UNHCR offers them financial support, giving each family that meets its criteria between $60 and $80 per month. But [those families] represent only 30 percent of all refugees,"" Rajabli said.Most refugees live in appalling conditions, squatting in deserted buildings or -- for those who get financial help from the UNHCR -- spending their meager subsidies on rooms or small apartments that have neither heat nor running water.To add to their hardship, Rajabli said most immigrants live in administrative limbo and are scarcely protected by the temporary refugee status offered by the UNHCR. ""Most refugees live how they can and where they can because the government does not help them find a roof,"" he said. ""It must be said in its defense, though, that there is not a single free public building, not a single free dormitory left because the IDPs have occupied all of them. Yet the government does not allocate any funds to build temporary refugee camps.""Another problem facing refugees who arrived after the breakup of the Soviet Union is the reluctance of Azerbaijani officials to consider their applications for citizenship. ""I haven't heard of many cases when those refugees managed to obtain citizenship,"" Rajabli said. ""I would say they are 10 or 15 at most. But even these estimates are questionable.""",,,

Instead, a highly uneven distribution of wealth has widened the gap between the rich and poor. Poverty still affects about half of the country's population. Its most extreme manifestation, homelessness, was virtually nonexistent in the past but can now be seen on the streets of Yerevan.Yerevan, 7 October 2004 (RFE/RL) -- For a man who has been homeless for almost 15 years, Vartan is remarkably health-conscious. Every morning he jogs in a park and eats two raw eggs afterward.That, says the 41-year-old university graduate, is American movie icon Arnold Schwarzenegger's recipe for fitness and good health: ""I haven't taken any medicine for 15 years. No drugs at all.""This statement seems more of a rebuke to Armenia's government than bravado. Vartan's sole contact with the government is periodical encounters with police officers who he says don't like to see him and his friends living on the street: ""I sold my apartment, divorced my wife, and now live on the street. But they must somehow take care of me. Instead they come and beat me up. We are not their slaves, are we?""Long-term homelessness has dimmed the sense of time for Vartan's Ukrainian-born girlfriend, Tatyana. She is not sure how old she is. ""I must be at least 46,"" Tatyana says, smiling.The couple had accommodation only last winter when they rented a room with proceeds from the collection of empty bottles and scrap metal. Their usual ""workplace"" is the area around a small agricultural market in Yerevan's northern Arabkir District. Traders there give them fruit, vegetables, and even meat.Homeless people like Vartan and Tatyana form the most underprivileged class of Armenians still reeling from the collapse of the Soviet command economy. Their number may not be large given the scale of poverty in the country. But it seems to have increased in recent years despite higher economic growth, which has seemingly done more to increase income disparities than to reduce poverty.Eleonora Manandian is the chairwoman of New Armenia. The youth organization engages in social work mainly by helping to get children begging in the streets back to school. She warns that prolonged poverty is eroding Armenians' traditionally strong family bonds -- ties that have helped cushion post-Soviet hardship: ""You may not see many homeless people on the streets. But the number of marginalized people keeps growing because social bonds are increasingly weakening. That is, people stop feeling [like] citizens -- full-fledged members of the society. And there will come a moment when they find themselves outside that society.""The social polarization is particularly eye-catching in Yerevan. Its glitzy center filled with restaurants and luxury cars increasingly contrasts with its rundown suburbs. Real estate prices downtown have skyrocketed since 2001, fueling a housing construction boom -- another indication of increased wealth.Yet enormous contrasts can be found even here. Alla, a 47-year-old single woman, has lived in the dry fountain at a public park flanked by apartment blocks for the past four years. She broke a hip joint last winter and can hardly walk: ""How do you think I manage to get by? It's neighbors that support me. They bring me water and food. They are nice to me.""Alla lost most of her relatives in a catastrophic 1988 earthquake in northern Armenian. She says not a single government official has ever visited or offered her any assistance.In fact, neither Armenia's Ministry of Social Affairs nor any other government agency has programs specifically for the country's homeless.According to government statistics, the proportion of the population living below the official poverty line declined from almost 50 percent to 43 percent last year due to an almost 14 percent surge in Armenia's Gross Domestic Product. The government says the robust growth continued into the first half of this year.However, little suggests that it has improved the lot of the 13 percent of Armenians officially considered to be living in ""extreme poverty."" It is still not clear how they might benefit from a government poverty-reduction program launched a year ago with the blessing of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The program seeks to bring the poverty rate to 19 percent by 2015 through job creation and increased public spending. The government plans to spend $6 million in 2006 to provide families lacking adequate housing with new homes. Sources in the Western donor community say the modest scheme has been recently narrowed to only Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan. This is bad news for thousands of people huddling in former factory hostels that lack basic amenities, such as running water and toilets. Many of them fit into the Western definition of homelessness.This is particularly true for the dozens of poor families squatting in a ramshackle buildings in the southern outskirts of Yerevan. Once dotted with big factories, the area is now an industrial graveyard. Last year, people started moving into the three-story building, which once housed a factory school. Armenuhi Boyajian, a single mother, moved in with her four children this summer. The oldest of her kids, a 15-year-old boy, dropped out of school three years ago and is now the family's main bread-winner due to his mother's poor health. Nor are his three sisters attending school due to their failure to submit official health certificates. Lying in bed and grimacing in pain, Boyajian says she can't afford to pay for the certificates: ""They want 3,000 drams ($6) for that. When I tell them that I'm a single mother they say that it mattered only in Communist times."" Susanna Boyakhchian, a hefty middle-aged woman, is slowly repairing the building's former toilet and is preparing to move in with her disabled son and his wife. They had owned a decent apartment that was confiscated in the late 1990s when he was imprisoned for a minor crime that his mother says he never committed. The family currently rents a room in a kindergarten. Boyakhchian, who sells second-hand clothing in a market, seethes with anger when asked what her government can do for them: ""I don't expect anything from this state because this state has ruined my life. I have been left on the street because of this state.""",,public,0

Acknowledging that unease, Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told parliament on 22 September that the Armenian contingent, which numbers some 50-60 medics, U.S.-trained sappers, and drivers, will be sent to Iraq only after the legislature has approved the planned deployment that he stressed is of a ""humanitarian"" nature.Deputy Defense Minister Artur Aghabekian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on 3 September that the Armenian contingent will serve in central-southern Iraq as part of a Polish-led international peacekeeping force. On 6 September, Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Polish counterpart Aleksander Kwasniewski signed a protocol formalizing the Armenian commitment. John Evans, the new U.S. ambassador to Yerevan, hailed Armenia's announced intention to send noncombat troops to Iraq, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on 16 September. But some senior military officers were less than enthusiastic. Deputy Defense Minister Lieutenant General Yurii Khachaturov told journalists on 7 September he is ""not delighted"" at the prospect. He expressed concern that the deployment could create future problems both for the Armenian community in Iraq and for Armenians in general.Armenians across the political spectrum appear to share those misgivings. Parliament deputy Grigor Harutiunian of the opposition Artarutiun faction warned on 14 September of the potential danger to Armenian communities throughout the Middle East, Noyan Tapan reported. One week later, a second Artarutiun parliamentarian, Viktor Dallakian, argued that the threat could extend to Armenia, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. He told parliament that ""sending a medical, humanitarian or any other Armenian contingent to Iraq is dangerous for the security of the Republic of Armenia as well as for the Armenian population of Iraq."" That minority is estimated to number some 20,000-25,000.Members of the Armenian community in Iraq have signaled their opposition to the planned deployment.Armenian civic groups issued a statement on 24 September appealing to the Armenian parliament not to approve the planned deployment. One signatory told RFE/RL that the deployment risks turning the entire Armenian minority in Iraq into hostages; a second argued that ""60 people cannot cause a breakthrough in the Iraq war.""In a 25 September press release, the extraparliamentary Hayrenik front argued that the dispatch of an Armenian contingent to Iraq ""will destroy the mutual trust and friendship between the Armenian and Arab peoples,"" Noyan Tapan reported. The press release suggested that the entire Armenian diapora could suffer ""human, cultural, and economic losses"" as a result.The planned deployment may even exacerbate perceived tensions within the governing three-party coalition. On 24 September, Vahan Hovannisian, a leading member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutiun, one of the two junior coalition partners, told parliament that as a signatory to the CIS Collective Security Treaty, Armenia should consult with Russia before sending its contingent to Iraq, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. He added that as a member of the Council of Europe, Armenia should similarly take into account the opinion of those European states -- he mentioned specifically France and Germany -- that opposed the U.S. intervention in Iraq. But Hovannisian too stressed that the primary consideration should be the safety of the large Armenian communities throughout the Arab world.Finally, members of the Armenian community in Iraq have themselves signaled their opposition to the planned deployment. Archbishop Avak Asadurian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service on 28 September that he has written to both President Kocharian and the Armenian parliament asking that Yerevan not send troops to Iraq lest the Armenian community there become ""a target for terrorists."" The wife of the priest at Baghdad's sole Armenian church said that the Arab population has already learned from media reports of the imminent Armenian deployment, and is displeased that ""even friendly Armenia...is going to help the occupiers.""But during talks in Yerevan on 28 September with Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Ruben Shugarian, Tariq Muhammad Yahya, an official from the interim Iraqi government, praised what he termed Armenia's ""balanced"" policy toward Iraq and called for the restoration of bilateral economic ties, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported.",,,

""We regret that the principle of inclusiveness could not be upheld in this case,"" the press release stated, without elaborating. But Lieutenant-Colonel Ludger Terbrueggen, who is a spokesman for NATO military command, told RFE/RL's Armenian Service the same day that ""the reason...is that Azerbaijan did not grant visas to soldiers and officers of Armenia.""Since January, Baku has sought repeatedly to thwart the planned Armenian presence at this year's Cooperative Best Effort maneuvers. Three Armenian military officers who tried to travel to Baku in early January first from Turkey and then from Georgia to attend a planning conference for the maneuvers were prevented from doing so. In June, members of the radical Karabakh Liberation Organization (QAT) picketed, and then forced their way into, a Baku hotel where two Armenian officers were attending a second planning conference in preparation for the exercises. Five of those QAT activists were arrested and sentenced in late August to between three and five years' imprisonment on charges of hooliganism, violating public order, and obstructing government officials. Those verdicts triggered protests from across the political spectrum, fueling public opposition to the Armenians' anticipated arrival.In April, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev assured Deputy Commander of the U.S. European Command General Charles Wald that there were no obstacles to the Armenian participation in the September war games. Other visiting U.S. officials also sought to impress on Azerbaijan the importance of allowing the Armenian contingent to attend. But in recent weeks, the Azerbaijani government has made increasingly clear its hostility to the planned Armenian participation. On 27 July, the independent ANS TV quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov as saying that Baku has stipulated that only noncombat personnel -- military journalists, public-relations officials, and military doctors -- would be permitted to attend, and that the number of Armenian participants would be limited to three. (On 4 September, however, Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Major General Artur Aghabekian said seven Armenian officers would take part in the exercises, while the number denied visas by the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tbilisi was given as five.)On 10 September, the Azerbaijani parliament adopted an appeal to NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to retract the invitation extended to the Armenian side, citing what it termed Armenia's aggression and policy of ethnic cleansing.The opposition daily ""Azadlig"" on 10 September quoted Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov as saying that Azerbaijan would not grant visas to the Armenians. And on 10 September, the Azerbaijani parliament adopted an appeal to NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to retract the invitation extended to the Armenian side, citing what it termed Armenia's aggression and policy of ethnic cleansing. The parliamentarians argued that the presence in Baku of Armenian military personnel could aggravate tensions in the region. President Aliyev stated while visiting the Barda region on 11 September, ""I do not want the Armenians to come to Azerbaijan.""In an apparent last-ditch effort to persuade Baku to abandon its obstructionist approach, de Hoop Scheffer summoned Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanian to Brussels on 13 September for talks. Oskanian subsequently praised the NATO decision to call off the exercises, adding at the same time that he regrets the ""lost opportunity for regional cooperation.""Armenia hosted the NATO Cooperative Best Effort-2003 exercises, in which some 400 troops from 19 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Georgia, and Turkey practiced routine peacekeeping exercises. Azerbaijan declined to participate. In February 2004, a junior Azerbaijani officer attending a NATO-sponsored English language course in Budapest hacked a sleeping Armenian fellow student to death with an axe.The full impact of Azerbaijan's violation of NATO's ""principle of inclusiveness"" and of NATO's ensuing decision to cancel the planned exercises is difficult to predict. The move is likely to corroborate many Azerbaijanis' conviction that NATO is guilty of double standards and bias toward Armenia. It may also give rise to a certain coolness between Brussels and Washington, in light of persistent rumors that the United States is considering Azerbaijan as a possible location for a rapid-reaction force. Certainly the prediction by one Western analyst that ""Azerbaijan will enter NATO by 2005,"" which made headlines in the Azerbaijani press in July 2002, now seems somewhat overoptimistic.",,,

That's the view of the OSCE's current chairman, Solomon Pasi. Pasi, who is also Bulgaria's foreign minister, says it makes sense now to concentrate on those parts of the world, in view of new international realities. He also said it would be ""far more useful"" to hold the OSCE's major annual economic forum in Central Asia rather than in Central Europe. RFE/RL reports on what looks like a shift in emphasis for the 55-member OSCE, which is Europe's largest security and rights body. Prague, 18 August 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), born in the days of the Cold War, is starting to take a fresh look at where its efforts can be most useful.Despite its name, the Vienna-based body includes the five states of Central Asia and the three South Caucasus republics among its members.Current Chairman-in-Office Solomon Pasi has several times in recent weeks spoken of the desirability of greater OSCE involvement in the sensitive Central Asian and Caucasus regions. OSCE spokesman Mikhail Evstafiev told RFE/RL that Pasi sent a letter to member countries earlier this summer in which he signaled his intention to push through various reforms aimed at equipping the OSCE to better face contemporary challenges.""The OSCE chairman-in-office [Pasi] also indicated that he would welcome discussing with the states of Central Asia and the Caucasus how they could benefit from the OSCE's invigorated activities. And he also hoped to see greater involvement by the CIS states in steering the bodies of the OSCE, including the chairmanship,"" Evstafiev said.Evstafiev noted that Kazakhstan is interested in taking over the rotating office of OSCE chairman, and that Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev will be visiting the organization's Vienna headquarters in early September.Pasi also suggests moving the OSCE's two biggest annual meetings eastward -- namely, the Economic Forum and the Human Dimension conference on rights and democracy. The first should move to Central Asia, and the second to the Caucasus.Pasi said the OSCE's Economic Forum ""can be of far more use"" to Central Asia, because Central European members already have other possibilities for help in their development, such as the European Union. The same logic applies to relocating the Human Dimension meetings. ""You are dealing with authoritarian regimes. You are dealing with strong leaders. You are dealing with lack of economic integration, lack of regional cooperation. Also, at the same time, a lot of the issues which worry the Central Asian states are of a regional dimension."" - VatankaA regional expert with the U.K.-based Jane's security publishing group, Alex Vatanka, told RFE/RL that it makes sense for the OSCE to increase its focus on those countries -- presently on the periphery of Western institutions -- because any insecurity in those regions will impact on Europe. But he said it will not be easy.""You are dealing with authoritarian regimes. You are dealing with strong leaders. You are dealing with lack of economic integration, lack of regional cooperation. Also, at the same time, a lot of the issues which worry the Central Asian states are of a regional dimension. They are not problems which can be solved single-handedly. For instance, the terrorism issue of Uzbekistan cannot really be dealt with alone by [President Islam] Karimov's regime. No matter how tough [his] policies become, he would need to deal with his neighbors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, to try to get to grips with the situation,"" Vatanka said.Vatanka said any initiative by the OSCE must also take into account the characteristics of each country. ""On every issue, on every level, you have variations within the eight states -- meaning the three Caucasian states and the five Central Asian states,"" he said. ""There is, for instance, a big difference between [for example] where Kazakhstan is likely to go because of its oil and gas wealth and because of its slightly more liberal [approach] than [for example] Turkmenistan.""Vatanka said pressure gradually applied by the West can pay off in terms of inducing more democratic behavior on the part of reluctant regimes. He pointed to Turkey, which has been trying to enter the European Union for 40 years. ""It took Turkey decades and decades before it started seriously taking on board the criticism they were facing, on such issues as minority rights for the Kurds, or providing more transparency, or removing the death penalty,"" he said. ""It took many decades, but now Turkey is finally on the path, and you could hope for that kind of situation with the Central Asian states or the South Caucasian states."" Another regional expert who would welcome increased OSCE involvement is Sabine Fraser of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. Fraser spoke with RFE/RL today from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.""This is part of the trend that the OSCE has been involved in during the past few years -- that is, to strengthen their presence both in the Caucasus and Central Asia.

But Armenian-Americans are politically active, and their political influence is stronger than their size would suggest. One prominent group, the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) has formally endorsed Senator John Kerry's campaign for the presidency against President George W. Bush. The ANCA says it doesn't simply support Kerry. It opposes Bush, accusing him of not honoring a promise he made when he needed votes during his first campaign for president four years ago.In February 2000, Bush was fighting hard for support in Michigan, which has a small but politically active Armenian population. He issued a statement saying his administration would recognize that Armenians were the victims of genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 1923. ""On the Armenian-American issues, coming from Massachusetts, which has a strong and active Armenian-American community, over the years he's [Kerry] had time to develop strong relationships with that community."" -- ChouldjianBush eventually won the presidency. But according to Elizabeth Chouldjian, the ANCA's communications director, he backed down on that promise, refusing to endorse the bills that each year come before Congress that would require the U.S. government to recognize the Armenian genocide. And that wasn't all. ""It hasn't so much been his [Bush's] silence in terms of not utilizing the term [""genocide""], but at the same time his administration's opposition to genocide legislation, which makes reference to the Armenian genocide in the framework of honoring the 15th anniversary of the U.S. implementation of the genocide convention."" Chouldjian said.Chouldjian points to that and many other actions by the Bush administration, including a reduction in aid to Armenia, siding with Turkey and Azerbaijan in their disputes with Armenia, and even trying to formally designate Armenia as a state sponsor of terrorism.Kerry, on the other hand, has for decades been active on issues important to Armenian-Americans, Chouldjian said. She points to his sponsorship of legislation on the genocide issue, on improved U.S. trade with Armenia. and on supporting Armenia against Turkey and Azerbaijan.""On the Armenian-American issues, coming from Massachusetts, which has a strong and active Armenian-American community, over the years he's [Kerry] had time to develop strong relationships with that community. And over his 20 years as senator, he has consistently been supportive of every single Armenian-American initiative that I can point to,"" Chouldjian said.Ross Vartian agrees that Kerry is a far more attractive candidate than Bush to Armenian-Americans. Vartian is the executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America, another nationwide advocacy group. Under its nonprofit legal status, the organization cannot, by law, formally endorse any political candidates. But Vartian said his contacts with Armenian-Americans around the country show that they greatly prefer Kerry to Bush, at least on issues important to Armenian-Americans.Vartian told RFE/RL that the ANCA's endorsement could be a help to Kerry. ""I would say that Armenian-Americans are known to be civically active and politically active,"" he said. ""It is something that we are urged to be by our own community and by our own parents. In terms of a voting bloc, we aren't so numerous in any given location that we're going to tip the balance unless the races are extremely close, but being involved in the political process is part of our tradition.""But Vartian stressed that it will not ensure that every registered Armenian-American voter will support Kerry. He said that like other Americans, voters of Armenian descent fall into three general categories: those who vote strictly in accordance with their party loyalties; those whose votes are based on issues that are important to their own community; and those who vote on more general issues.Vartian said that because of their activism, Armenian-Americans appear to have disproportionate political influence in that they can persuade some members of Congress to sponsor legislation they support. But he said their ultimate influence on elections remains modest.""When races are that close, there are probably a hundred different groups who could make that claim and could make that difference,"" Vartian said. ""So, yes, technically, Armenians in Michigan could make the difference in a very close race. But if it's true for Armenians, it's true for about 99 other groups as well. And that's why I believe that when these two major political efforts -- Kerry's and Bush's -- concentrate on states like this, they don't leave out anybody, including the Armenians.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1054123.html,Azerbaijan WarMongering Or Warning ,"August 02, 2004 01:15 GMT",,,"Azerbaijani President Aliyev Over the past two weeks, one former and two current top Azerbaijani officials have again affirmed their collective rejection of international mediators' insistence that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict can be resolved only on the basis of mutual concessions. Whether those Azerbaijani statements were intended primarily for domestic consumption, or whether and to what extent they should be construed as warnings to the international community not to pressure Azerbaijan too forcefully to agree to concessions that might trigger a major public backlash, is as yet unclear. Meanwhile, two senior U.S. diplomats have made clear that Washington continues to hope for a swift resolution of the conflict. The first statement came on 15 July at a reception hosted by the U.S. ambassador to Baku, Reno Harnish, in honor of the visiting OSCE Minsk Group co-chairmen. Addressing the gathering, the three co-chairs each stressed that no outsider is in a position to resolve the conflict, and that the parties must themselves reach an agreement. In that context, they welcomed the resumption of talks between senior Armenian and Azerbaijani officials (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 9 July 2004). Vafa Guluzade, who resigned in October 1999 after serving for years as President Heidar Aliyev's foreign policy adviser (see ""RFE/RL Caucasus Report,"" 14 October 1999), publicly rejected that advice as ""absolutely unacceptable and impermissible,"" and as intended to force Azerbaijan to come to terms with the loss of part of its territory.In an interview with zerkalo.az published one week earlier, Guluzade had said that any country whose territory is occupied but which fails to prepare for a war of reconquest should be regarded as ""criminal."" He also suggested that both the U.S. and the ""West Europeans"" have failed completely to grasp the essence of the Karabakh conflict, otherwise they would realize the futility of trying to get Azerbaijan to reconcile itself to the loss of its territories. In addition, Guluzade disclosed that during his tenure as President Aliyev's adviser, ""we discussed all variants"" for resolving the conflict, and they were all ""still-born:"" Baku immediately rejected them as every single peace proposal unveiled to date entailed the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh, Guluzade said.Any country whose territory is occupied but which fails to prepare for a war of reconquest should be regarded as ""criminal.""Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov, by contrast, opined in a 28 July interview with zerkalo.az that a new war ""is not the optimum way"" to resolve the conflict. But at the same time he implied that any compromise should come from Yerevan. A sensible compromise with the Armenian side can be reached only if Armenia publicly renounces the idea of independence for Nagorno-Karabakh, Mammadyarov said. In that interview, Mammadyarov said he believes that each of the co-chairs (France, Russia, and the U.S.) seeks to promote its own interests in the South Caucasus. Several days earlier, however, he sought to imply that Washington does understand that many Azerbaijanis categorically reject the prospect of the loss of sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh. Mammadyarov was quoted by zerkalo.az on 22 July as saying that during his talks the previous week in Washington with U.S. officials, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell noted that it is imperative to take public opinion into account when drafting a settlement proposal. The online daily further quoted Mammadyarov as saying that it is not ""realistic"" to speak of ""resolving the conflict"" until the displaced persons who fled during the fighting (in 1992-1993) have returned to their homes. It is not clear, however, whether by this Mammadyarov is advocating a ""phased"" approach to a settlement, or whether Baku would accept a ""package"" solution in which repatriation preceded the announcement of Nagorno-Karabakh's future status.Finally, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev told members of his country's diplomatic service on 27 July that ""if the path of negotiations leads us nowhere, Azerbaijan will use all other means available, including the military option,"" Turan reported. Referring to the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs' calls for ""compromise,"" Aliyev said no compromises can be made over Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Aliyev has made similar statements on numerous occasions in recent months, most recently on a tour last week of northern districts of Azerbaijan. Both Mammadyarov and Aliyev stressed that international law favors Azerbaijan, which is the victim of ""Armenian aggression,"" and the territory of which is partially occupied.The Armenian Foreign Ministry reacted sharply to Aliyev's 27 July statement, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported on 28 July. Spokesman Hamlet Gasparian said Aliyev's comments show that ""Azerbaijan has no desire to settle the Karabakh conflict by peaceful means and is laying its hopes on a solution by force."" He warned that the latter course of action would have ""disastrous consequences"" for Azerbaijan.Meanwhile, the U.S. Minsk Group co-chairman, Ambassador Steven Mann, told Russia's Regnum news agency that he understands that the leaders of both Armenia and Azerbaijan are in ""a difficult position"" because passions are running high on both sides. But at the same time, he argued that the two presidents should eschew emotion and try to reach a compromise. On 28 July, zerkalo.az quoted John Ordway, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Yerevan, as urging that the conflict be resolved as soon as possible. The paper quoted him as saying that ""the status quo is acceptable to the U.S. only as the sole alternative to the beginning of hostilities,"" and as expressing the hope that a settlement could be reached next year. That proposed timeframe prompted Azerbaijani commentator Rauf Mirkadyrov to conclude that Washington is trying to strong-arm Baku into a settlement lest the commissioning of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, now tentatively scheduled for the summer of 2005, be jeopardized by a resumption of hostilities.",,,

The three told RFE/RL's Robert McMahon that in spite of the convention's frequently stage-managed appearance, it offers some useful lessons in their own struggles to bring democracy to the South Caucasus. Boston, 30 July 2004 -- They represent some of the major opposition voices in the sometimes turbulent world of transitional politics in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.But for this week, at least, Stepan Demirchian, Ali Kerimli, and Davit Gamkrelidze were content to sit on the sidelines and observe the opposition party convention in Boston. Demirchian, Kerimli, and Gamkrelidze were among hundreds of diplomats, politicians, and political activists attending the convention as guests of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.In separate interviews with RFE/RL, the three politicians said the convention held useful lessons for their own countries' difficult reform paths. They also gained insight into the foreign policy priorities of key advisers to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.Kerimli is chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party's (AHCP) reformist wing and is a lead figure in attempts to reunite the fragmented Azerbaijani opposition. He said beyond the stagecraft on view in Boston, he saw the convention as an important confidence-boosting exercise for the opposition Democratic Party.""The convention is orchestrated as a big show, [there are] a large number of participants, they use the stage for propaganda,"" Kerimli said. ""The convention itself does not decide anything because all decisions have already been taken. The convention simply illustrates the will of the candidate to win, the presentation of his team, of his program -- this was of particular interest to me.""Gamkrelidze is chairman of the New Conservative Party (formerly the New Rightists Party) of Georgia -- the only opposition party in that country's parliament. He said the convention provided a useful model for organizing an effective campaign. He said it highlighted the importance of well-trained activists and volunteers, who are the foot soldiers of major U.S. parties.Davit Gamkrelidze said the convention demonstrated some of the strengths of multiparty democracy, which he said Georgia lacks.Gamkrelidze said the convention demonstrated some of the strengths of multiparty democracy, which he said Georgia lacks.""This balance -- balance between the Republicans and Democrats -- is first of all a huge benefit for the citizens of the United States and when you [don't have] this balance it means that the government and ruling party, they lose control over themselves and it's very dangerous, and we already [have found] out in Georgia that the government and the new leaders in the Georgian state, they somehow lost control over themselves,"" Gamkrelidze said.For Demirchian, leader of the Justice Faction in the National Assembly of Armenia (HZhK), the U.S. convention has helped illustrate how far his country must travel on its path to democracy. ""We have to learn a lot. So, democracy needs consistent work. Hard work,"" Demirchian said.Demirchian lost to President Robert Kocharian in a 2003 presidential runoff. He and other opposition leaders have alleged that Kocharian falsified that vote and led protests this spring demanding the president either organize a national referendum of confidence on his rule or step down.Demirchian, Kerimli, and Gamkrelidze were eager to hear any mention of Democratic Party policy on issues such as Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia's role in the South Caucasus. But most speeches and panel discussions focused on Iraq, the Middle East, and the Democrats' strategy for waging the war against international terrorism.Kerimli said after a briefing given by top Kerry foreign-policy advisers that the Democrats favor greater engagement with allies and multilateral institutions.""America has now to make a very important choice -- how it will continue to be the leader in the world,"" Kerimli said. ""Of course, America does have a leadership role, but the question is how this role will be [put to use] and how this role will be implemented -- together with the world or alone. The Democratic Convention shows an inclination toward solving the problems in participation with all international organizations.""Gamkrelidze sensed little difference in the main foreign policy goals of U.S. Democrats and Republicans.""It's my impression [there are] not big differences between the two parties, first of all about the security, about the war against terror, also such things as values and spreading of the values. It's good for me because it's always dangerous when there is a big shift,"" Gamkrelidze said.The three politicians were among participants from more than 120 countries who came to Boston under the sponsorship of the National Democratic Institute. It was believed to be the largest group of foreign observers ever to attend a U.S. electoral convention.The institute, a nonprofit organization, aims to establish political and civic organizations, safeguard elections and promote accountability in government.(RFE/RL's Nikola Krastev contributed to this report.)",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1053808.html,Analysis Russia Coordinates New Broadside Against OSCE ,"July 12, 2004 13:29 GMT",,,"At Moscow's instigation, the six CIS states that are members of the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan), together with Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, issued a statement in Vienna on 8 July harshly criticizing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and calling for a fundamental refocusing of its priorities and activities. The statement, which was adopted during a meeting of CIS heads of state in Moscow on 3 July and bears the imprimatur of the Russian presidential press service, charged that the OSCE ""does not respect such fundamental...principles...as noninterference in internal affairs and respect for national sovereignty,"" and that it is guilty of double standards by focusing ""selective attention on certain states while ignoring problems in other states."" It claimed that the OSCE's humanitarian activities are restricted to ""monitoring the human rights situation in the countries of the CIS and former Yugoslavia,"" and that this almost exclusive focus on the human rights dimension ""significantly restricts"" its ability to counter new challenges and threats.The statement further targeted the OSCE's Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), noting that its primary activity of election monitoring is frequently ""politicized and fails to take into account the specifics of individual countries."" Over the past decade, ODIHR monitoring missions have criticized as failing to meet European standards most of the ballots, both parliamentary and presidential, in all the nine states that signed the condemnation.The joint statement also criticized as ""ineffective"" the OSCE's field missions in the CIS, noting that their financing consumes a significant chunk of the OSCE's budget. It claimed that instead of fulfilling their mandate ""to provide assistance to the government of the host state,"" those missions concentrate ""exclusively"" on the human rights situation and engage in ""unwarranted"" criticism of the domestic political situation.It concluded that ""the OSCE's agenda should include the swiftest removal of the imbalance between the three dimensions of the organization's activity by increasing the role of its military-political, economic, and environmental elements,"" and called for drafting ""new approaches"" to the organization's work.Speaking in Moscow on 8 July, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Chizhov warned that Russia and other CIS states might ""lose all interest"" in the OSCE if it continues to ""degenerate"" rather than reform.This is by no means the first time that Russia has criticized the OSCE for allegedly neglecting the security aspect of its original mandate. Exactly 10 years ago, in July 1994, then-Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev formally proposed that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), as it was then called, should assume the role of an umbrella organization with overall responsibility for coordinating security in Europe, in cooperation with NATO, the West European Union, and the Council of Europe. A Russian Foreign Ministry official told Interfax on 20 July 1994 that other CIS states supported that Russian proposal. A Russian parliamentarian said the Russian proposal was prompted by NATO's shortcomings, specifically with regard to peacekeeping. He said NATO's Partnership for Peace program launched earlier that year ""is an interesting forum for cooperation in military training and joint exercises, but it does not...guarantee security in Europe."" But the underlying Russian rationale was clearly concern at the prospect of NATO expansion to incorporate one or more of the former Warsaw Pact countries.At its summit in Budapest in December 1994, the CSCE changed its name to reflect its enlarged membership and shifting priorities in the wake of the collapse, first of socialism in Eastern Europe, and then of the USSR. But Russian politicians continued to lobby persistently for enhancing the OSCE's security component and specifically for the adoption of a new European security charter. Addressing a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers in Copenhagen in December 1997, then-Russian Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov argued that the OSCE ""should be the appropriate framework for the reinforcement of pan-European security."" At the same time, he urged that the proposed OSCE charter should not mandate ""interference into the domestic affairs of member states.""The new OSCE security charter was finally adopted at the Istanbul OSCE summit in November 1999. It outlined intended ""new steps,"" including enhancing the focus on security, expanding the OSCE's role in peacekeeping, and the need to counter the growing threats of terrorism, extremism, and drug trafficking. It also stresses the potential threat to regional security posed by ""acute economic problems and the degradation of the environment."" By that time, however, it was already clear that Russia was losing the battle to forestall NATO's expansion eastwards: the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary were formally admitted to the alliance at its Washington summit in April 1999, and seven more countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) were to follow suit in early 2004.Russia, nonetheless, persisted in its criticisms of the OSCE. In June 2000, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgenii Gusarev complained that unnamed Western countries were trying to narrow the OSCE's focus to human rights issues in the former East Bloc. He said such efforts ""would reduce the OSCE to nothing,"" and warned that Russia ""will do everything to prevent this."" In January 2001, Russian diplomats presented to OSCE Secretary-General Jan Kubis proposals for reforming the OSCE, which met with a lukewarm reception.The most recent Russian broadside against the OSCE came just days after the NATO summit in Istanbul failed to designate any CIS states as potential candidates for a future round of NATO expansion. Instead, the final communique signed at the summit stressed the importance of enhanced ""cooperation"" and closer ""partnership"" between NATO and the states of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, and also Ukraine. The question therefore arises: is Russia trying to persuade its CIS allies that in light of NATO's increased geographical focus on ""out-of-area"" operations, such as its engagement in Afghanistan, on the one hand, and its reluctance to designate any CIS states as potential future members, on the other, a revamped OSCE could guarantee European security just as effectively?It should be noted that of the four CIS states (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan) that have made clear their aspiration to join NATO, two (Georgia and Azerbaijan) declined to sign the joint statement criticizing the OSCE. Turan on 10 July quoted a spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry as saying that Baku had proposed an alternative draft statement that contained the accusation of double standards but also arguing that the OSCE's primary mandate is conflict prevention and mediation, specifically averting ""ethnic cleansing"" and ""the occupation of the territory of sovereign states."" Ukraine and Uzbekistan, by contrast, endorsed the Russian initiative.",,,

A written statement signed by Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan said the OSCE does not respect fundamental principles such as noninterference in internal affairs and respect of national sovereignty. Prague, 9 July 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Russia's delegation at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), on behalf of nine members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), yesterday presented a statement accusing the human rights watchdog of what it called ""double standards.""Aleksei Borodavkin, Russia's permanent representative at the OSCE, read the document at a meeting of the Vienna-based group's Permanent Council. The statement says the 55-nation organization -- of which all 12 CIS nations are members -- focuses too much on promoting human rights and democratic institutions in certain countries, while overlooking others.Borodavkin said the presidents of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine endorsed the statement on 3 July during an informal meeting in Moscow. The statement rebukes the OSCE for giving ""selective increased attention"" to some countries while ignoring problems in other participant states and accuses it of ""unwillingness to consider the realities and peculiarities of a single state."" Of the OSCE's 18 field activities, 12 are in the former Soviet Union.Russian political analyst Fedor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the Russian quarterly ""Russia in Global Policy,"" told RFE/RL that the statement shows many CIS countries are becoming increasingly frustrated with the stress that the OSCE places on respect for democracy and human rights. ""The leaderships of most CIS countries are now equally annoyed with the fact that the OSCE's activities have long become limited to monitoring the situation with respect to democracy and human rights in these countries,"" he said. Of course, the state of democracy in all of the post-Soviet countries leaves much to be desired."" -- LukyanovRussian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Yakovenko said the OSCE focuses its field missions in the CIS countries and the Balkans, while ignoring the rights of national minorities in Latvia and Estonia. Russian-speaking minorities in those Baltic countries have complained of discrimination.The OSCE was also part of a monitoring mission that declared Russia's presidential election in March short of democratic standards, particularly where state media was concerned. The Belarusian government announced in October 2002 that it was closing the OSCE's office in Minsk after accusing the organization of supporting the opposition and meddling in the country's internal affairs.The common CIS statement was not signed by Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Georgia, while Moldova made a reservation that more attention must be given to the OSCE's insufficient effectiveness in the resolution of territorial conflicts. ""Certainly, the OSCE has annoyed practically all CIS countries with few exceptions -- for instance, Georgia, which has not signed [the OSCE declaration]. I have the impression that the new Georgian leadership hasn't yet managed to anger the OSCE. But, of course, the state of democracy in all of the post-Soviet countries leaves much to be desired,"" Lukyanov said.Both Moldova and Georgia have been entangled in long-running disputes with separatist regions such as Transdniester, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia. Mediation efforts that also involved the OSCE have so far proved fruitless. Even some of the signatories to the statement have said they do not have complaints about the OSCE, but signed the statement out of solidarity with other CIS members.Abdil Segizbaev, a press aide to Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev, told RFE/RL: ""If there are some shortcomings of the OSCE in [our partner] states [within the CIS], then our duty is to speak out and advise on that [to the OSCE]. I think the statement could appear in such a way. That is why, I suppose, Kyrgyzstan could join the statement. Regarding our internal situation, I would say that Kyrgyzstan does not have [any complaints about] the OSCE. Until now, the OSCE has been doing a great job here. If the OSCE will continue its cooperation with us in such a way, then we will be happy with that.""The EU and U.S. missions to the OSCE argued in response that human rights and rule-of-law issues cannot be considered internal affairs. In a statement issued by the Netherlands, which holds the bloc's rotating presidency, the EU said it would reflect on the issues raised by Russia and the other nations, but added that it has ""serious concern about certain elements of the declaration.""",,,

It is not involved in the country's political life and is doing its best to survive the country's postwar hardships. The community has learned the art of survival and keeps a low profile amid the strife engulfing Iraq's other ethnic and religious groups. RFE/RL correspondent Valentinas Mite visited with members of the ethnic Armenian community in Baghdad and filed this report. Baghdad, 6 July 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The Armenian Apostolic Church in Baghdad's Al-Jadirya district is full of worshippers on a recent Friday morning. The faithful pray to God to bring them peace and security and to give them strength to survive these difficult times.Nareg Ishkhanian is a pastor at the church. He tells RFE/RL that the Armenian community in Iraq is small and spread across the country.""We are more than 20,000 Armenians, starting from Zakhu [a town on the border between Turkey and Iraq] to Al-Basrah. Zakhu, Mosul, Baghdad, Al-Basrah, and Kirkuk -- in each place, we have a priest. Most of the Armenians are living in Baghdad -- about 10,000 to 12,000 Armenians [are] living in Baghdad.""Armenians began arriving in Iraq several centuries ago from Iran, first settling in the south and gradually moving to Baghdad.Armenians began arriving in Iraq several centuries ago from Iran, first settling in the south of the country and gradually moving to the capital, Baghdad. The biggest wave came at the start of the 20th century when ethnic Armenians fled Turkey after a massacre by Turkish soldiers in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. Armenia claims as many as 1.5 million people were killed, a figure that Turkey disputes.Now, many ethnic Armenians in Iraq work as -- among other professions -- merchants, doctors, engineers, goldsmiths, and photographers. The tiny Christian community is not involved in Iraqi politics.Says Ishkhanian: ""We, as a small community, agree with everything, and we say to everybody, 'Salam Alaikum' (Peace be upon you).""He says Armenians do not suffer from sectarian problems in predominately Muslim Iraq. However, they suffered under the regime of Saddam Hussein, as he says all Iraqis did.Two decades ago, Karabed Agoub Gidigain -- who is in his 80s -- was one of the richest traders in Baghdad. His company imported timber, plastics, and clothing. In 1992, after the regime ran out of money after the first Gulf War, Gidigain says he was ordered to give all of the money he had in his foreign accounts to the Hussein government. When he refused, he says he was tortured and that most of his company's assets were confiscated.Gidigain says he is too afraid and too old now to start everything anew.Making even one rich man poor is a blow to such a small community. However, behind the low profile the community keeps there is a variety of activity. Ishkhanian says the Armenians in Baghdad have four cultural and sport clubs. But he says such activities as singing folk songs and dancing or theater performances have temporarily stopped because of security concerns.Other activities -- such as teaching the Armenian language -- have never stopped. Ishkhanian says every Armenian in Iraq learns the native language from early childhood. He notes that Armenia itself offers little assistance to the Iraqi community. The community hopes to receive aid from Yerevan, but nothing is available at the moment.""We had good contacts with Armenia. [Armenia] had an embassy in Baghdad, and they left in March 2003. Until now, they are not back. And the house of the embassy belongs to the Armenian church. We gave it [to Yerevan] free of charge.""Ishkhanian says it is a pity the ethnic Armenian community in Iraq does not enjoy more support from Yerevan. He says some financial support trickles in from Armenians living in the West -- in the United States, Britain, or Germany.Ishkhanian says the main achievement of the ethnic Armenian community in Iraq is that it has managed to keep its language alive and maintain strong solidarity. He says the community never leaves its members in trouble. Gladys Boghossian is the president of the Armenian Women's Association for the Relief of the Poor in Iraq, an organization that works closely with the Armenian Apostolic Church. The association was founded in 1927.Boghossian says the numbers of those in need in Iraq is greater now than ever before: ""Now, we have too much [work] to do because of this war. We started to give them food and medical treatment.""She says the association is taking care of some 300 families -- almost 1,000 people. Among the benefits, Boghossian notes that every poor Armenian can get free medicine in pharmacies serving the community. Eglantine Simon Geloian works for the association. She says that when her own family was in need, it received significant assistance from the association.""We are a very poor family,"" she said. ""The church has provided work for my husband. He works in the church. Not only me -- any person who asks the church for help is given help. The church never hesitates to give help.""On the surface, life in the ethnic Armenian community in postwar Iraq seems fairly comfortable. However, some members of the community -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- say it is only a facade that hides deep divisions.They say some Armenians cooperated with the former regime and lost trust among the people but remain in leading positions. Armenians in Iraq also bitterly accuse their leaders of corruption, especially in dealing with financial help coming from abroad.",,,

He will meet the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to talk about the EU's recent decision to include the three countries in its ""new neighborhood"" policy. Brussels, 5 July 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Janez Potocnik is a junior commissioner. But he is by far the highest-ranking EU official to tour the South Caucasus region in recent years. As a commissioner for a new EU member state, Slovenia, Potocnik works with the enlargement commissioner, Guenter Verheugen. Verheugen is in charge of the EU's ""new neighborhood"" program, which offers closer ties to some EU neighbors. Although not directly responsible for the new neighborhood program, Potocnik fully represents the views of the European Commission.He will spend this week traveling to Georgia (5-6 July), Azerbaijan (6-7 July), and Armenia (7-8 July). Potocnik's visit will emphasize the EU's renewed interest in those three countries. Following Georgia's ""Rose Revolution"" last year, the EU was quick to bring them into the new neighborhood policy. The formal offer was finalized on 14 June. Jean-Christophe Filori is a European Commission spokesman. He explained to RFE/RL today what the offer will mean for the three countries: ""The next steps are to consider the possibility of setting up a so-called action plan with those three countries -- setting the [reform] priorities they should address. And, on our side, offering an approximation with the European Union. That, as you know, could eventually -- but in the longer term -- lead very far toward a share in the internal market, for instance, or [alignment] with several EU policies, like environment or [energy and transport] networks."" Filori said Potocnik will tell the three South Caucasus governments that they could eventually have a voice in Europe. Potocnik will not offer precise details of the financial aid likely to accompany new neighborhood membership. EU member states are still debating the contents of the bloc's next budget for the years 2007-2013. But EU officials say Potocnik will reiterate the bloc's willingness to take a more active approach to the region's many conflicts. The bloc will not act as a mediator. But it will use incentives inherent in closer ties to foster compromise. Filori says this strategy has proved successful elsewhere: ""Take, for instance, the example of Romania and Hungary, the issue of the Hungarian minority. Through a very early and intense political dialogue, we [found] a solution. And we really hope that with this prospect of getting closer to the European Union we will also have the possibility of a much better political dialogue with [the South Caucasus] countries."" The EU promotes its new neighborhood policy as distinct from bloc membership but offering many of the same benefits. Filori said the EU is not likely to discuss anytime soon a further EU expansion that would bring countries like Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan into the bloc: ""We can never say never, of course -- we will have to see. What we're trying to do now is to set the prospect for the foreseeable future. And in the foreseeable future, we have an approach allowing for much closer involvement of those countries in Europe, and a much closer involvement of the EU in those countries -- much closer relations. It would be a first step. Let's seize this offer first."" The EU has made it clear that it will consider developing relations with the three countries on the basis of individual merit.

Touted by some as the ""trial of the century,"" many observers note that the kind of justice Hussein receives will be indicative of Iraq's commitment to building a just civil society on the ashes of his regime. Other issues addressed today include the sacking of 60 Bosnian Serb officials for the government's failure to locate and apprehend Radovan Karadzic and other indicted war criminals; taking the time to get nation-building projects right; Russia's bid for influence among its neighbors and beyond; and whether targeted assassinations -- in Chechnya, the Gaza Strip, or Afghanistan -- undermine the chances for peace. THE NEW YORK TIMESIn Saddam Hussein's Iraq, ""fear, death and vengeance were the only laws of the land,"" says an editorial in the New York daily. ""A new Iraq must be built on more solid foundations: democracy and the rule of law."" And one of the first challenges will be bringing its former leader, Saddam Hussein, to justice. The paper says Hussein ""should have a fair trial under an elected government applying the relevant principles of Iraqi and international law.""Iraq's former president will be formally charged today along with 11 of his top officials before a tribunal established in December by the U.S.-led Iraqi Governing Council. The court is headed by Salem Chalabi, the nephew of Iraqi exile Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress. The paper says proper trials will take several months and offer the opportunity ""to unravel the mysteries and crimes of the Baathist era, including the secret mass graves and the true story of unconventional weapons programs."" But the proceedings should not begin until an elected Iraqi government takes power in January. To begin the trials before holding elections ""would not serve justice or help restore Iraq's standing in the international community.""As of today, the 12 accused men will officially be ""criminal defendants under the legal authority of Iraq's interim government."" And as legal defendants, the paper says they must ""have the rights that go with their new legal status, including the chance to consult with their lawyers and safeguards against abusive interrogations.""The new Iraq should be a country ""where the rule of law applies impartially to all.""THE INDEPENDENTThe London-based daily says the image of Saddam Hussein ""in court, in shackles and under guard, will be the most potent symbol that the regime in Iraq has changed.""And both U.S. and Iraqi authorities can be expected to use this symbol to full advantage. ""If this public relations exercise can help to convince the people of Iraq that there is hope for the future, and so reduce the carnage on the streets, then so much the better,"" the paper says. But Hussein's day in court ""should not blind us to the perilous situation that remains in Iraq.""His trial will be ""a vital part of banishing the past and laying the foundations of the new state."" But many decisive questions, such as whether Hussein should face the death penalty if convicted, should be left up to the elected government that will emerge from January's elections. For now, ""the best that can probably be hoped for is that the proceedings should have international jurists as observers and be conducted to internationally recognized standards."" There might be some pressure ""from the families of those who fell victim to Saddam's regime and from the many who felt the harshness of his rule themselves, to press for more summary justice. Any resort to the lynch mob, however, must be resisted.""""The Independent"" writes: ""How Saddam Hussein is treated will say much about the sort of state that Iraq is likely to become. Punctilious observance of judicial proprieties would be the best augury for a stable and law-governed Iraq in the future."" THE TIMES""The impact of this event in Iraq [will] be huge,"" says the London daily. ""The effect in the wider Middle East, a region where dictators are rarely deposed[,] nevermind held to account, could be extraordinary."" How the trial of Saddam Hussein moves ahead ""will do much to shape the image of Iraq's new government in the international community,"" and will be ""as significant as his fall 15 months ago or his capture last December."" The paper lauds the fact that it is an Iraqi court that will hear Hussein's case rather than the international tribunal at The Hague, which could have allowed the case to ""[drag] on for years and provided a propaganda platform for the defendant."" And ""The Times"" says fears that the former Iraqi leader would receive hasty justice motivated by revenge have been misguided. ""Saddam Hussein was, properly, made aware of his rights yesterday [and] he will acquire legal representation for his defense."" These are the actions ""of serious people determined to be seen as acting correctly, especially as a death penalty is highly likely."" Bringing the case against Hussein will not be easy, the paper says. Most people believe Hussein was aware of the torture and murder of his political opponents; the 1988 gassing of the Kurds in Halabja; the launch of the Iran-Iraq war; the 1990 invasion of Kuwait; or the slaughter of thousands of Shi'a after their uprising the following year. But even from the 30 tons of documentation to be reviewed, producing the proper evidence, ""with the necessary political fingerprints and convincing witnesses,"" will prove a challenge.The paper also calls for the trial to be as open as possible, including allowing television cameras into the courtroom. ""[Every] moment should be carried live,"" and there must be no perception of censorship. THE IRISH TIMESThe Dublin-based daily's Chris Stephen discusses the sacking yesterday of 60 Bosnian Serb officials as ""punishment"" for their failure to locate and apprehend former Serbian leader and indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. Stephen calls the move by Paddy Ashdown, the top international administrator in the country, ""the most drastic action yet taken by Western officials against Bosnia's former warring factions since the end of war in 1995.""Ashdown's ""frustration"" is shared far to the north in The Hague, where prosecutors have had to revise their optimistic assessment from the beginning of June that Karadzic could be in custody by the end of the month. The fact that Karadzic -- whom Stephen calls the ""bouffant-haired former poet who led the Bosnian Serbs to war in 1992"" -- remains a free man ""is a major embarrassment for the international community."" When the civil war following the breakup of Yugoslavia ended, NATO forces in Bosnia ""refused to arrest him and he lived openly in a villa 20 minutes from the NATO headquarters. When NATO's policy changed in 1997 and war crimes arrests began, Karadzic vanished. He has been missing ever since.""Several attempts by NATO commandos to apprehend Karadzic have failed, and Stephen says ""with the NATO force now only 7,000 strong in Bosnia, the chance may have been missed.""THE MOSCOW TIMESAn editorial in Moscow's English-language daily considers the thorny issue of targeted assassinations.""Entire theses could be written on whether extrajudicial execution of suspected terrorist leaders can be justified"" in legal terms, says the paper. But these arguments ""do not answer a vital question about the effectiveness of assassinations of leaders of radical Islamic groups and terrorist networks."" Israel, for example, might experience temporary lulls in violence after it targets and kills suspected Hamas leaders. ""Damage to an organization, though, does not necessarily hurt its cause, and Palestinian rage has only been fueled.""The February killing of former acting Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev by two Russian security agents in Doha brought no letup in violence in the Caucasus, the paper notes. Since then, the Kremlin-backed Chechen president, Akhmed-hadji Kadyrov, was assassinated, and a raid by hundreds of suspected Ingush and Chechen fighters in Ingushetia left dozens dead. The two Russian agents involved in Yandarbiev's killing were sentenced yesterday to 25-year prison sentences by a Qatari court. Yandarbiev's death ""might have had a short-term effect on the financing of the rebels, but it definitely dealt no mortal blow to their command and control,"" the paper says.And ""just like the assassinations of the Hamas leaders, the killing of [Yandarbiev] might in the end generate more support for the separatists' cause in Chechnya, as [Yandarbiev's] followers seek to portray him as a martyr.""Under these circumstances, the Moscow daily says, ""the idea of assassinating a leader in an attempt to bring down an entire movement is a dangerous myth, where the biggest collateral damage is to the long-term chances for peace.""INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNEDavid Malone and Kirsti Samuels of the International Peace Academy say it is well known that nation building ""is a long and complex process, but the dynamics of international relations encourage rushed interventions."" A ""short international attention span, a growing list of crisis states [and] the pursuit of 'exit strategies' that suggest [an] early and happy ending"" all serve to render many international interventions hasty and, often, incomplete. ""If we are serious about state-building, it is time to face up to the reality. Building institutions that are robust enough to deal with the vicissitudes of human nature and political activity is not a quick process. It is futile to take on ambitious state-building projects and then succumb to international and domestic short-termism.""The authors say this approach is not only ""morally deplorable,"" it is also ""unjustifiable on pragmatic grounds, since the resources, effort and time invested are all to naught when crisis reignites.""Malone and Samuels suggest separating a nation's nascent political process from the transfer of control over institutions. ""A staggered process of institutional handover,"" like that effected in Kosovo, might be a better approach. A real commitment to nation building ""requires a clear-eyed prioritization of crises, and the realization that the world should respond to a few crises better rather than to try to respond to more and fail.""THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITORA contribution to the daily by Daniel Twining, a former U.S. Senate foreign policy adviser and now of the German Marshall Fund, discusses Europe's ""frozen conflicts"" and Russian influence on the borders of Europe.Moldova, for example, is ""a country where the Cold War never ended."" Russia maintains troops in Moldova to support Transdniester's bid for secession, and the Moldovan president effectively ""answers to leaders in Moscow."" Meanwhile, the region is home to international criminal networks trafficking in humans, weapons, and drugs. ""[Political] reform in Moldova has been frozen by the Transdniestria crisis,"" Twining says. And the Kremlin's ""Transdniestria strategy"" is similar to its approach to other ""frozen conflicts"" that are also ""sustained by Russian military forces and political support,"" including the provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Twining says Moscow's ambition is to ensure Russian troops ""guard European borders and serve as outposts of imperial control in independent [nations]. In the absence of treaties legitimizing Russia's illegal military presence on its neighbors' territory, Russia will keep these conflicts 'frozen' -- ensuring that secessionist leaders who answer to Moscow remain in control."" Twining advocates a united trans-Atlantic campaign ""to resolve the frozen conflicts and democratize Europe's borderlands."" He also suggests putting these outstanding disputes on the agenda of the NATO-Russia Council. Together, he says, the United States and Europe ""should condition deeper Russian access to Western markets on Moscow's willingness to negotiate democratic political solutions to Europe's frozen conflicts.""",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1053548.html,Analysis Mediators Seek New Formula For Karabakh ,"June 26, 2004 12:30 GMT",,,"On 21 June, the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the French, Russian, and U.S. co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group met for the third time in 10 weeks to discuss approaches to resolving the Karabakh conflict. Three days later, Russian co-chairman Yurii Merzlyakov announced in Moscow that the discussions focused on a new peace proposal that would bridge the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two sides.Since 1998, Armenia has insisted on a ""package"" solution to the conflict that would address and resolve all disputed issues in a single agreement, without leaving any ""loose ends,"" even if the various provisions of that agreement were implemented not simultaneously but consecutively, over time.Azerbaijan, by contrast, favors a ""step-by-step"" approach, under which a series of separate aspects of the problem would be addressed and resolved one at a time, and the second problem or set of problems would be addressed only after measures to implement the first had been successfully completed. That approach would theoretically enable Azerbaijan to demand a major concession from Armenia -- such as the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the regions that they currently control bordering on the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic -- without making a concession of similar magnitude in return.That approach is anathema to Yerevan, insofar as it entails the possible danger of Armenia surrendering its biggest ""bargaining chip"" -- the occupied districts -- without securing in return what it considers most important, namely a cast-iron agreement that Nagorno-Karabakh should not be vertically subordinated to the Azerbaijani central government.U.S. diplomats previously involved in the Minsk Group process say that the ""package"" approach was the basis for the tentative agreements, known as the ""Paris principles,"" arrived at during the spring of 2001 during talks in Paris and Florida between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his Azerbaijani counterpart Heidar Aliyev. Aliyev, however, apparently subsequently realized that it would be more difficult than he originally thought to persuade the Azerbaijani people to accept a peace agreement that required a major concession from Baku. (Precisely what status Nagorno-Karabakh was to have been granted under the ""Paris principles"" remains a matter for conjecture. Aliyev rejected a proposal by the Minsk Group in late 1998 that Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh should form a ""common state."")The failure of the ""Paris Principles"" underscores the degree to which the outcome of any peace process is inevitably hostage to domestic political considerations, specifically, the willingness or the reluctance of national leaders to risk their careers by agreeing to concessions that many voters consider not only politically unacceptable but an insult to the memory of those who gave their lives fighting. While success could be rewarded by a nomination for the Nobel Peace prize, failure, or even badly judged timing, can spell the end of a political career.One of the reasons for Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian's forced resignation in February 1998 was his readiness to accept a ""step-by-step"" peace plan unveiled by the Minsk Group the previous September. Azerbaijan's current president, Ilham Aliyev, who hopes to win a second presidential term in 2008, has little incentive to undermine his chances of doing so by making major concessions before then, and indeed has said on several occasions that he will ""never"" do so.The conflict sides and the OSCE Minsk Group have a gentlemen's agreement not to divulge either specific proposals under discussion or the reactions of one side to statements by the other. That insistence on the confidentiality of the negotiating process is intended to preclude the leak of details that could destroy a tenuous consensus reached in months or even years of talks by provoking a domestic political backlash that might even endanger the stability of one or both governments. But the lack of detailed information also serves to engender any amount of speculation, disinformation, and rumors concerning peace proposals that have no formal status -- such as that by EU rapporteur Per Gahrton early this year that Armenia withdraw its forces from five occupied Azerbaijani districts in return for the resumption of rail communication between Azerbaijan and Armenia.Merzlyakov's Moscow disclosure suggests that there are indeed grounds for cautious optimism that a solution to the conflict could be reached. But Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov warned that it will take time. The Azerbaijani daily ""Ekho"" on 24 June quoted him as comparing the negotiations to cooking, implying that for the best results, neither process should be rushed. At the same time, Mammadyarov expressed confidence that the final product will be both ""tasty"" and ""digestible"" to everyone.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1053532.html,Western Press Review NATOs New Challenges Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi And EU Constitutional Hurdles ,"June 25, 2004 14:11 GMT",,,"Prague, 25 June 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Several items in the press today take another look at NATO, following a request this week by Iraq's Prime Minister Iyad Allawi for the alliance to help provide security in the country and ahead of the upcoming alliance summit in Istanbul. The role of NATO is also discussed today in light of its continuing mission in Afghanistan, which many believe is foundering due to the failure to extend a troop presence to areas outside Kabul. We also take a look today at Allawi as he prepares to take up the reins of government with the 30 June transfer of power to his interim Iraqi administration. Political reform in Armenia and the fledgling EU constitution, agreed on 19 June following all-night marathon negotiations, are also discussed. THE CHICAGO TRIBUNEWhile the world's attention is now focused on the impending 30 June transfer of authority to Iraq, its interest is flagging in another country where a democratic opportunity ""is already at hand, waiting to be seized.""Afghan citizens, ""after a quarter-century during which they suffered civil war, Soviet occupation, Taliban rule and the arrival of Al-Qaeda,"" are scheduled to go to the polls in September for presidential and parliamentary elections. But in the run-up to these crucial ballots, ""they are getting less international help than they were promised, and far less than they deserve."" Afghan Transitional Administration Chairman Hamid Karzai is expected to win the presidential poll ""easily,"" the paper says. But a more important question ""is whether security will be adequate to allow most Afghans to register and vote without risking their lives.""The help Karzai has received so far has been ""insufficient."" NATO has deployed only 6,400 troops to Afghanistan and most of these remain in and around Kabul, leaving the Karzai government with little control beyond the capital. Pledges to donate more troops and funds have failed to translate into concrete aid.""It's not terribly surprising that NATO would be reluctant to send forces to help in Iraq since the American invasion was so unpopular in Europe,"" the Chicago daily says. But it is ""harder to imagine why Europeans would be so miserly when it comes to Afghanistan.""NATO allies are now at risk of not finishing the job they began in Afghanistan. ""The elections planned for September are a major test of NATO's seriousness about multilateral efforts to fight terrorism and spread democracy,"" the paper says. ""So far, it's failing.""FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNGThe ""loud chorus of praise"" for the EU constitutional treaty is only partly being sung for what the document actually says, says columnist Gunther Nonnenmacher. ""The rest is an expression of relief that a process begun in December 2001 with the appointment of a convention has actually come to a successful conclusion.""Much of the squabbling over the document was due to a disagreement over decision-making and representation. The new EU text now states that ""a majority vote of 55 percent of the member countries in the Council of Ministers must represent 65 percent of the EU population."" The paper calls this a logical apportionment, because the decision-making process now ""recognizes that Europe is not only an organization of governments but also of people."" But European leaders must now go before their constituents to ""try to sell an unwieldy document that contains about 80 pages devoted to institutional regulations, about 30 devoted to basic rights, and about 50 devoted to an appendix with protocols."" And all these pages ""are filled with a language that is laborious and, at times, simply incomprehensible.""So it still ""remains to be seen whether the constitutional treaty will become historic."" And given the low turnout and ""voter skepticism"" seen in the 13 June elections to the European Parliament, Nonnenmacher says national referendums on the constitution ""could lead to the rejection of the treaty -- and possibly to the failure of the draft.""LE FIGAROAlexandrine Bouilhet discusses a letter sent on 21 June from the Iraqi prime minister, Iyad Allawi, to NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer requesting NATO aid in stabilizing his country after the scheduled 30 June transfer of power. Bouilhet says while Allawi's request emanated from Baghdad, it was largely inspired by the United States. The appeal, which Bouilhet says was made public by Washington, comes ahead of a scheduled NATO summit and is sure to be a hot topic of conversation when the allies meet in Istanbul on 28-29 June.Without going so far as to request the deployment of NATO troops to Iraq, which Bouilhet says would be ""as absurd as it is unrealistic,"" Allawi has proposed that NATO take charge of local security forces such as the army, the police force, or customs officials. De Hoop Scheffer has said he trusts the allies will respond ""favorably"" to Allawi's letter in Istanbul. Italy and the East European countries hastened to lend their support to the secretary-general. But all eyes then turn to France and Germany, ""the troublemakers of NATO,"" who hold veto power in Brussels. Whereas Washington has insisted for months that it wishes to share the Iraqi burden with its allies, Paris and Berlin have always refused to take decisive action, not wishing to give the impression that they sanction the U.S.-led occupation.But the U.S.-Iraqi request will be hard to refuse, Bouilhet says. Sixteen of 26 NATO members are already involved in Iraq through training or other projects. After all, she says, U.S. President George W. Bush is not the only one who wants to involve NATO in Iraq's rebuilding.EURASIA VIEWA contribution by Cory Welt, a Russian and Eurasian affairs analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discusses recent indications of a willingness to reform coming out of Yerevan. On a recent trip to Washington, Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian ""outlined a bold vision for political reform, regional security, and cooperation with neighbors Azerbaijan and Turkey."" His statements ""provided a welcome change to the disheartening news"" that has been coming out of Armenia in recent months.Welt says the Armenian government's ""brutal crackdown against opposition protests this April, its attacks on journalists, the ransacking of opposition headquarters, and political arrests were a blatant contradiction of democratic standards."" But Oskanian's remarks ""appeared to be more than mere PR [public relations] pitches,"" as the minister ""also laid out means for allowing Armenia's opposition to reconcile its differences with the government."" ""While chiding Armenia's political opposition for 'its aggressive attitude' towards the authorities, Oskanian revealed a standing government offer to give opposition deputies [veto] rights on three issues: amendments to the election code, constitutional reform, and anti-corruption legislation.""But whether the leadership in Yerevan will truly ""seize the opportunity to implement this plan for political dialogue remains in doubt, however.""The opposition failed to galvanize much support for protests last spring, and ""[returning] to parliament with concessions akin to the ones Oskanian described would be a face-saving maneuver,"" as its popularity has since fallen.Welt says, ""While the opposition's failure to mount a serious challenge might give Armenian authorities confidence to further inhibit official respect for rule of law, the government's newfound security could [also] encourage it to move in a positive direction."" THE ECONOMISTAn item in this London-based weekly magazine says the accession to power of Iraq's new prime minister, Iyad Allawi, has given rise to the hope ""that a swelling majority of Iraqis, seeing control of their country reverting to their compatriots, will rally to the new order,"" help it undermine the insurgency, ""and so gradually let Iraq reach a state of minimal normality in which a patchy peace, a measure of prosperity and a modicum of political civility if not full-fledged democracy can prevail.""Little may change on the ground with the return of Iraqi sovereignty on 30 June, the magazine says. Soldiers and civilians are likely to continue dying and Iraq ""will remain a conquered land, with Iraqis accusing the infidel of still defiling the nation and its holy places by the mere fact of [his] presence.""But some significant things will change, says the magazine. Allawi has made clear that Iraq reserves the right to ask the U.S.-led forces to leave, and Washington has indicated they will if asked to do so. The changes are ""not just semantic,"" says ""The Economist."" Unlike the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, ""the incoming regime is an Iraqi one with executive powers endorsed unanimously in the UN's Security Council, approved by virtually all the countries of the Middle East and in the Muslim world."" More importantly, so far it seems that most Iraqis, ""however warily,"" are willing to give it a fair chance. ""What they want above anything else -- way above democracy, it must be admitted -- is peace. If Mr. Allawi can use an iron fist to achieve that, they are very likely to back him.""THE WASHINGTON POSTThe paper's David Ignatius says the hope for interim Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi ""is that he can use parts of the old power structure to restore security to a country that, over the past year of occupation, has been coming apart at the seams.""Ignatius, who is acquainted with the Iraq politician, says Allawi ""has the advantage of a stolid imperturbability. Trained as a medical doctor, he seems unfazed by a life of repeated assassination attempts, including one in 1978 that nearly killed him. He's an amiable, somewhat disheveled man who has to be prodded to buy the fancy clothes befitting a politician."" Since his nomination as prime minister, Allawi ""has made a surprisingly fast [start], issuing almost daily proposals and public statements. Inevitably, he has tried to distance himself from his U.S. patrons.""""Allawi's appeal, and also his liability, is that he will govern Iraq as a strongman. His biggest problem these next few months will be staying alive, in the face of death threats. His only real protection will be the support of other Iraqis. ""In that sense, for all the U.S. troops who will remain after Wednesday's [30 June] handover, Iraq's fate will really be in the hands of Iraqis once again.""",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1053331.html,Caucasus EU Increasingly Targeting Georgia Over ConflictStricken Armenia Azerbaijan ,"June 15, 2004 15:10 GMT",,,"The European Union this week formally included Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in its European Neighborhood Policy. The move does not open the door to EU membership -- officials studiously avoid speculation, saying simply membership is ""not on the agenda."" However, the new neighborhood initiative could, over the next decades, lead to free trade, substantial aid grants, and extensive political dialogue with the EU. In the South Caucasus, Georgia now appears best placed to make use of EU goodwill, while officials say the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains a serious obstacle for Armenia and Azerbaijan. Brussels, 15 June 2004 (RFE/RL) -- With increasing confidence, EU officials are singling out Georgia as deserving star treatment among the South Caucasus countries.It was Georgia's ""Rose Revolution"" that forced the EU to reverse its decision to exclude the region from its neighborhood policy. The decision to include the South Caucasus was formally confirmed on 14 June by EU foreign ministers. What is seen as President Mikheil Saakashvili's genuine desire for reform has propelled Georgia far ahead of its two neighbors in terms of EU attention.The EU's special representative for the South Caucasus, Finnish diplomat Heikki Talvitie, spoke in Brussels today praising Georgia's pioneering role. ""Basically, when I started [last July] we had on the agenda [the question], 'How to develop these relations [with the South Caucasus]?' And then suddenly the 'Rose Revolution' happened in Georgia and this accelerated things a lot. Georgia became [a] focus [for] international politics; Georgia got the priority on the agenda of many countries -- including the United States, Russia, Turkey, the European Union, among others, and our member states. This meant that there was a sort of a push to our relations with the South Caucasus,"" Talvitie said.What is seen as President Mikheil Saakashvili's genuine desire for reform has propelled Georgia far ahead of its two neighbors in terms of EU attention. EU foreign ministers on 14 June decided to launch a ""rule of law"" mission in Georgia to help the country improve its criminal-justice system. Not only will it be the first EU mission of its kind, it also marks the first application of the bloc's defense and security policy outside of the Balkans or Africa. Tomorrow, a World Bank-sponsored donors conference for Georgia will take place in Brussels. The United States and Russia sit side by side with EU member states and the European Commission. Officials say the pledges are expected to total almost 500 million euros ($607 million) from 2004 to 2006. Speaking privately, EU officials say the bloc has no choice but to focus on Georgia. Saakashvili's anticorruption drive is seen as particularly impressive. The recent peaceful defusing of the stand-off with Adjaran strongman Aslan Abashidze is another credit to Saakashvili's name. EU sources note that Talvitie, together with the U.S. ambassador to Georgia and former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, played an important mediating role. The EU, however, remains concerned over the possibility of conflict in another troubled Georgian region, South Ossetia. Another challenge Saakashvili is said to face is that of allowing a credible opposition to appear. Armenia and Azerbaijan, meanwhile, are in the back seat. Their main problem is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. One EU official told RFE/RL that although the EU wants to help both countries, ""we cannot do much with two armies facing each other.""Talvitie today said democratic reforms in both countries have also been slow. ""Azerbaijan and Armenia naturally had been [in] focus earlier [with their] elections,"" he said. ""And that has been a little bit negative development because we had expected quite a lot, especially in Armenia, concerning the elections, [as regards] the democratic process, fair and free elections. It was a little bit of a disappointment that the Armenians could not fulfill the expectations. In Azerbaijan, the situation was the same, but basically we are now over this period and we are working with both Azerbaijan and Armenia on their constitutions and how to develop further respect for human rights, [the] rule of law and democratic process.""EU officials stress that both Azerbaijan and Armenia must take steps for the more than 10-year-old mediation effort to get off the ground. Sources make clear, however, that the bloc seeks no formal mediating role in the foreseeable future.Instead, said Talvitie today, the EU stands by with offers of substantial aid. ""If there's [a] need for some rehabilitation program in order to start the peace process, the EU could be ready to tackle these programs, to really make positive initiatives in order to facilitate, even in a detailed way, a solution, try to find a solution,"" he said.The EU is also conducting discreet talks with Turkey and Russia on the issue. Meanwhile, Talvitie said today, the EU is preparing concrete aid measures to help relieve tensions between Georgia and its breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In South Ossetia, a new railway link with Georgia is planned, as well as support for refugees. As for Abkhazia, plans for a construction program are under way to span a valley cutting the region off from the Georgian mainland.Overall, EU officials say Armenia is in the least favorable situation of the three countries, having to rely heavily on its diaspora in Russia and elsewhere in the absence of significant natural resources. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, has massive oil reserves, which will also benefit Georgia by means of a new pipeline to the Black Sea, which will be put into operation next year. EU officials have in recent weeks praised the constructive role Russia has begun to play in the region. One senior diplomat mentioned the Adjaran crisis, as well as ongoing talks with Georgia on joint border management. The diplomat said Russia has clearly become interested in stability on its southern borders. The diplomat said good links exist between EU and U.S. diplomats in the region. He said the U.S. stance became significantly ""more cooperative"" during the spring, adding that this has allowed a detailed coordination of efforts to take place.",,,

Two weeks earlier, the presidents of the two countries, Robert Kocharian and Ilham Aliyev, held similar talks on the sidelines of the European Economic Summit in Warsaw (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 29 April 2004). Oskanian on 30 April quoted Kocharian as saying he believes his talks with Aliyev in Warsaw ""can really contribute to finding common ground for the basis of negotiations at future meetings,"" RFE/RL's Armenian Service reported. Oskanian added that ""there will be clear instructions from the presidents to the foreign ministers regarding putting the negotiations on a certain basis. So we see positive movement and believe there will be a continuation."" That formulation suggests that the Warsaw talks clarified the Azerbaijani negotiating position. In an interview published in the ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"" following his 16 April talks with Mammadyarov in Prague, Oskanian said that meeting failed to shed any light on how seriously a statement made by Mammedyarov's predecessor, Vilayat Guliev, in February should be taken. Guliev had advocated beginning talks again from zero (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 13 February 2004). Oskanian told the German daily he believes Guliev's statement was intended purely for internal Azerbaijani consumption. Neither Oskanian nor Kocharian has given any indication of what issues were discussed during their respective talks with their Azerbaijani counterparts. But Mammadyarov told AFP on 30 April that the two sides are discussing the withdrawal of Armenian forces from seven districts of Azerbaijan bordering on the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in exchange for the restoration of rail communication between the two countries. ""The subject of our negotiations right now is how ready the sides are to make compromises,"" AFP quoted Mammadyarov as saying.Ilham Aliyev said on 7 May that the proposal that Armenian forces withdraw from the seven districts in return for the resumption of rail communication originated in Baku, and was not suggested by the U.S., Russian, and French co-chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group, which has been attempting to mediate a solution of the conflict for the past 12 years. The EU initially included in a resolution on the South Caucasus adopted earlier this year a demand for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Agdam, Djabrail, Fizuli, Gubadly, and Zangelan districts of Azerbaijan in return for the restoration of rail communication between Azerbaijan and Armenia, but Oskanian at the time rejected that approach, and the demand was dropped before the final version of the resolution was passed (see ""RFE/RL Newsline,"" 30 January, 3 and 27 February, and 1 March 2004). It is not clear why, having rejected earlier this year the initial EU proposal to withdraw from five districts, the Armenian side should now be prepared to discuss withdrawing from seven districts, as the Azerbaijani officials claim.Meanwhile, Vladimir Kazimirov, who served in mid-1990s as the Russian co-chairman of the OSCE Minsk Group, has again slammed Armenia's stated preference for a ""package"" solution to the conflict that would simultaneously resolve all contentious issues. In an interview published on 30 April in ""Nezavisimaya gazeta,"" Kazimirov said a package solution to such a complex conflict is ""impossible,"" and that continued insistence on it ""will only freeze the situation and lead the mediation into a blind alley."" Instead, Kazimirov argued, it would be more advisable to begin the search for a solution with comparatively minor points.In a second article, published in ""Vremya novostei"" on 7 May, Kazimirov argued that it is important to reestablish a mechanism for constant contacts between the two sides. He pointed out that the presidents of the two countries ""cannot meet that often, and one should not place the entire responsibility for concessions on them personally."" Similarly, Kazimirov continued, the foreign ministers also have numerous other responsibilities. Therefore, he concluded, it would be better for each side to choose a delegation that would concentrate exclusively on the Karabakh conflict. In addition, he argued that the leadership of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic should be included in talks on ""general issues"" related to a solution of the conflict. Azerbaijan, however, has consistently rejected any Karabakh representation at peace talks. Kazimirov suggested that the renewed peace talks should focus simultaneously on four issues on the principle of ""territory for security."" Those four issues are: strengthening the existing cease-fire and precluding a resumption of hostilities; removing the root of the conflict by addressing the future status of Karabakh; removing the consequences of the conflict by withdrawing Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani districts, demining operations, and the return of displaced persons to their homes; and what he terms ""elementary measures to reduce tension and normalize relations."" Kazimirov acknowledged, however, that progress on the second and third issues would be slow.",,,

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1052569.html,World Council Of Europe Scrutinizes Rights Violations In Belarus Political Situation In Armenia Azerbaijan ,"April 30, 2004 15:05 GMT",,,"Azerbaijani President Aliyev is under pressure over political prisoners The Strasbourg-based Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe today wraps up the second part of its 2004 spring session. The main highlights of this week's session included hearings on human rights abuses in Belarus, an urgent debate on the political situation in Armenia, and an address by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Prague, 30 April 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The 45-member Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted this week to recommend that the council's Committee of Ministers considers suspending all contacts with the Belarusian leadership until an independent investigation is conducted into the disappearances of journalists and political opponents.In a separate resolution, PACE warned that failure to comply would lead to maintaining sanctions against Belarus, or barring the country's parliamentarians from attending the assembly's sessions even informally. The warning came just two weeks after the UN's Human Rights Commission censured Belarus over the disappearances and other rights abuses. Belarus had its special guest status in the Council of Europe suspended in 1997, amid claims that its constitution was falling short of democratic standards and handing too much power to President Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Since then, Belarus has been regularly criticized in Strasbourg for its poor human rights record, including harassment of nongovernmental media, restrictions of religious freedom, and reports of random arrests.""As a criminal lawyer, I have no doubt that these disappearances were ordered at the highest possible level in the establishment of Belarus.""This week's PACE recommendation and resolution refer to the disappearance and feared extra-judiciary execution of former Interior Minister Yury Zakharanka, former parliament speaker Viktar Hanchar, businessman Anatol Krasouski, and Dmitri Zavadsky, a cameraman for the Russian private television channel NTV.All four disappearances, which occurred in 1999 and 2000, are believed to be politically motivated. Although Belarusian authorities deny any wrongdoing, they have persistently ignored calls to conduct independent investigations into the cases.Greek Cypriot delegate Christos Pourgourides, who authored a report on Belarus that was debated at the assembly before the 28 April vote, said the people responsible for these disappearances should be searched for among the country's top leadership.""As a criminal lawyer, I have no doubt that these disappearances were ordered at the highest possible level in the establishment of Belarus. I cannot be certain that the order was given by President [Lukashenka] himself, but I am absolutely certain that the order for their abduction was given by people very, very close to the president,"" Pourgourides said.In another resolution adopted this week, the Strasbourg-based assembly severely criticized Belarus for the ""systematic harassment and intimidations carried out by state officials...against journalists, editors, and media outlets which are critical of the president"" or the government.Russia, which is linked to Belarus by a union treaty, expressed its disagreement over the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the assembly.Talking to journalists after the vote, Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the documents for being ""too emotional."" Russia itself has been criticized in the past in Strasbourg for human rights violations in Chechnya. Although the situation in the breakaway Northern Caucasus republic was not on the assembly's agenda this week, it was nonetheless debated among members of PACE's Political Affairs Committee.In comments made to RFE/RL's North Caucasus Service, PACE's rapporteur on Chechnya, Andreas Gross, said he plans to visit the region in early June with other members of the Political Affairs Committee. He said he will prepare a report to be debated at the assembly's next plenary session later that month.""Since I was appointed rapporteur last July, I [have never been] allowed to visit Chechnya, and [there] is no use to make a report based only on journalists' [accounts]. You have to go on a [fact-finding] mission yourself. But now, after one year, I have the impression that the Russian authorities -- and especially the new Russian delegation [here] -- are much more cooperative, and we agreed on a mission [so that] we could make a report,"" Gross said. Whether Russian authorities will allow the Swiss delegate to meet Chechen separatist President Aslan Maskhadov -- as he says he intends to -- remains unclear, however.The situation in Armenia, where President Robert Kocharian and his coalition cabinet are engaged in a bitter standoff with opponents, was also debated this week in Strasbourg.Armenia's parliamentary opposition accuses Kocharian of rigging last year's presidential and legislative polls and insists his leadership should to be put to a vote of national confidence. The Armenian capital, Yerevan, has witnessed daily opposition rallies for nearly three weeks now. Tensions bubbled over on 13 April when police rounded up dozens of opposition activists and raided opposition party offices.The crackdown was strongly criticized by Council of Europe Secretary-General Walter Schwimmer, who regretted the absence of democratic debate in Armenia. In a resolution adopted this week, PACE urged the Armenian leadership to refrain from any actions that could be seen as attempts at curtailing freedom of expression and movement. It also called for an investigation into the recent incidents. While reiterating its ""profound disappointment"" at last year's ""flawed"" elections, the assembly also urged Kocharian's opponents to strive to achieve their goals ""within the constitutional framework"" and called upon both sides to enter into a dialogue ""without preconditions.""Armenia was admitted into the Council of Europe in January 2001, along with its neighbor Azerbaijan.Although neither country met democracy standards, the Strasbourg-based body hoped that opening its ranks simultaneously to the rival nations would help them reach a solution to their territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Yerevan and Baku remain technically at war over the predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave. For various reasons, both sides have rejected successive settlement blueprints drafted by the Minsk Group, the 13-member group of nations mandated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate in the talks. Addressing the PACE assembly yesterday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev reiterated his country's traditional stance, which consists of demanding that ethnic Armenian troops withdraw from all Azerbaijani lands they have been occupying since 1993, prior to any discussion on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev succeeded his then ailing father last October following a controversial presidential election marred by irregularities, street violence and the subsequent arrest of opposition activists. During his three-year tenure as his country's chief PACE delegate, Aliyev often had to adopt a defensive position amid criticism of Baku's poor human rights record. Yesterday, however, his first address to the assembly as Azerbaijani president was delivered in a much more cordial atmosphere.Aliyev hinted that he might release all inmates that the Council of Europe insists are political prisoners. However, when asked whether he thought he could do so before PACE's September session, the Azerbaijani leader remained noncommittal.""When I was elected, in my first speech after my inauguration, I said I would be the president of all Azerbaijanis -- and that is what I am doing. The policy of putting an end to the dramatic history of the past will continue, but it is very difficult to do that alone. All political forces must take an active part in doing that. The steps that I have taken in pardoning prisoners show that intention and that policy, and I think that that policy will continue,"" Aliyev said. Last month, Aliyev signed a decree amnestying nearly 130 prisoners, including Suret Huseynov, a former prime minister who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999 on charges of plotting against the state. Huseynov's release brought down to five the number of political prisoners that the Council of Europe wants Azerbaijan to release in the coming months.In the meantime, an estimated 100 opposition activists detained last October have been charged over their alleged participation in postelection violence. Some of them have already been convicted, while others are still awaiting trial.Aliyev yesterday justified the crackdown on the opposition, describing it as protection against the ""hostility"" that he says continues to exist in Azerbaijani society.",,,

The brutal dispersal early on 13 April ofthousands of peaceful demonstrators in Yerevan dealt a heavy blow toPresident Robert Kocharian but is unlikely to prevent furtherchallenges to his rule, whose legitimacy the Armenian oppositionquestions.The Armenian opposition, smarting from the worst crackdown todate on its activities, has vowed to continue its campaign for regimechange and plans to resume its anti-Kocharian rallies on 16 April.Whether its supporters will again be directed toward the presidentialpalace remains unclear. Much will depend on the size of the crowd,which should signal whether ordinary Armenians unhappy with theirgovernment have been intimidated by the early-morning mass beatingsand detentions unleashed by security forces or goaded by suchofficial actions.That the use of force was aimed at not merely dispersing thedemonstrators but injuring and terrifying as many of them as possibleseems obvious. More than 10,000 people mobilized by the oppositionArtarutiun bloc and the National Unity Party (AMK) walked up thecity's Marshal Baghramian Avenue leading to the presidential palaceon 12 April. They were stopped by hundreds of riot police lined upbehind two rows of razor wire about 200 meters away from Kocharian'sresidence. They never attempted to break through the cordonthroughout the eight-hour standoff.There were still between 2,000 and 3,000 protesters on thestreet when the attack began at 2 a.m. local time. Within minutes,truncheon-wielding special police and deafening stun-grenadeexplosions sent them fleeing toward a key intersection in downtownYerevan. But their escape route was blocked by other police units,which joined in the indiscriminate beating.Even journalists were not spared the violence. Three of them,including a photographer for a leading Armenian daily and a cameramanfor Russia's ORT television station, were severely beaten and hadtheir cameras smashed by police. This writer had to seek refuge inthe backyard of a nearby private home along with about 30 fleeingprotesters, elderly men and women among them; at least two men hadghastly wounds to their faces, and one of them fainted at one point.His companions did not dare summon an ambulance for fear of exposingthe hideout.The orgy of beatings was accompanied by the ransacking of theoffices of the main opposition parties. There has been no officialexplanation of that extraordinary measure. According to the Armenianpolice, 115 people, including three members of parliament, werearrested that night, although most were released in the next 24hours. Kocharian and his senior allies have justified the crackdownby accusing the opposition of planning the ""violent overthrow ofconstitutional order."" They have warned that any further attempts toforce them out of power will be countered with similar steps. But theopposition has said the authorities themselves violated Armenia'sconstitution by rigging last year's presidential and parliamentaryelections.The joint Artarutiun-alliance and National Unity Party (AMK)rallies in Yerevan, which began on 9 April, were not big enough toseriously threaten the ruling regime, which effectively blocked theroads leading to the capital to reduce attendance at the oppositiondemonstrations. But its heavy-handed response suggests that Kocharianfears the kind of snowball effect that set off the November ""RoseRevolution"" in neighboring Georgia in the wake of reputedlyfraudulent parliamentary elections. The success of the Georgianuprising, hailed by the West, clearly inspired the Armenianopposition.Yet the West's reaction to the latest events in Armenia hasbeen markedly different. In what some observers interpret as agesture of support for Kocharian, the U.S. State Department issued acautiously worded statement on 13 April expressing regret over themass arrests and calling on ""both sides"" to embark on a ""dialogue.""Washington commented on neither the police response to the peacefuldemonstration nor the increasingly dangerous conditions in whichArmenian journalists operate.The Council of Europe has reacted in a similar fashion, withits secretary-general, Walter Schwimmer, complaining that informationcoming out of Armenia is ""incomplete and conflicting."" Schwimmer hasa permanent representative in Yerevan, Natalia Voutova, but she haskept a low profile throughout the crisis, remaining silent even afterArmenian authorities renewed the wholesale arrest of oppositionactivists earlier this month under the country's Soviet-era Code ofAdministrative Offenses. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council ofEurope has repeatedly expressed ""shock"" at authorities' arbitraryenforcement of that code during and after the February-March 2003presidential elections.There has been no official reaction so far from the EuropeanUnion, which pledged recently to pay greater attention to politicalreform in the South Caucasus. The Yerevan-based ambassadors of thelargest EU member states urged Kocharian last week to exercisecaution in dealing with the opposition protests.The dramatic developments in Armenia highlight the root causeand the principal source of long-term political instability in thatcountry: the absence of an effective mechanism for the democraticrotation of power among the main political groups. None of thenational elections held there since independence have been judgedfree and fair by the international community. The only regime changethe country has had in the last 13 years resulted from governmentinfighting, not the expression of popular will.Any dialogue between the government and the opposition ishighly problematic under such circumstances. For the latter, the pathto state power lies along Marshal Baghramian Avenue rather than atpolling stations.

,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1052309.html,Armenia Georgia Battle Dissimilar Crises ,"April 14, 2004 18:11 GMT",,,"Armenian security forces confront protesters By Richard Giragosian Washington, 14 April 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The South Caucasus once again faces the threat of instability as the still-fragile Georgian and the well-entrenched Armenian governments each face escalating internal challenges. There are key differences, however, between the Georgian and Armenian situations that suggest very different trajectories for the two countries.First, there is a fundamental difference in the nature of the threat faced by each state. The immediate challenge to the Georgian government posed by its ongoing confrontation with the assertive leadership of the autonomous region of Adjaria is only one aspect of a much greater challenge that constitutes a serious test of legitimacy and authority for the struggling Georgian state. That threat is further magnified by the loss of territorial control over the breakaway unrecognized republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and by the steady erosion of authority from the central government to the regions. Resolving the confrontation with Adjaria is therefore just one step toward the larger task of reversing this devolution of power and strengthening Georgian sovereignty by restoring central-government control over the entire country.In neighboring Armenia, by contrast, the political opposition is seeking to dislodge a powerful government apparatus. Unlike the threat to the Georgian state, the Armenian crisis is more a competition between elites and less a threat to state authority, although the reaction of the Armenian leadership undoubtedly creates doubt about the durability of its legitimacy.The second key difference between the two crises lies in the nature of the two regimes. Despite a superficial similarity, the political situation in Armenia today is significantly different from that in Georgia in late 2003, when President Eduard Shevardnadze was forced from power in a peaceful ""Rose Revolution."" The Georgian transition was unique and holds no real lessons for Armenia. Regime change in Georgia was the result of a complicated combination of factors, very few of which are present in Armenia. Most importantly, the outcome in Georgia was due as much to the weakness of the state as to the strength of civil society. It was, in other words, a combination of a power vacuum and a weakened state that presented the opportunity for the peaceful advent to power of a group of young pro-Western politicians headed by former Justice Minister Mikheil Saakashvili.In Armenia, however, the reverse is true. A strong and assertive state is exercising, without restraint, its powers of control and intimidation against a traditionally marginalized opposition. The Armenian regime also differs from its Georgian counterpart in its reaction to the confrontation. By resorting swiftly to force and coercion, the Armenian leadership has contributed to a cycle of violence and an ""arrogance of power"" that can only bolster the opposition in the long run. But even with the potential of Armenian civil society, there is no easy or open avenue to confront the government, despite the illusion of the opposition's demands for impeachment and sporadic demonstrations in the streets. The fate of democracy in Armenia is, in fact, very much in danger; and the real challenge to Armenian national security comes from within, not from any external threat.Yet the political situation in Armenia today is more complex than a simple confrontation between the Armenian government and the political opposition. There are a number of internal fault lines running through Armenian society that could determine the course of the opposition-government political standoff.Politics in Armenia is increasingly expressed in a contest between entrenched elites on the one hand, and a ruling elite happy to rule but hesitant to govern and an opposition whose appeal lies in the personalities of its leaders rather than its platform, on the other. This competition of elites is marked by a struggle for control over the country's limited resource base and economic assets, a struggle in which the political opposition is also a well-established player. The largest and most significant group excluded from this competition for wealth is the majority of the Armenian population, which remains impoverished and disenfranchised from the real political process.It is this divide between the ruling and aspiring political elite and a frustrated although largely apathetic and weary Armenian population that serves as the one potential advantage for the opposition. By tapping widespread general frustration and mistrust of the incumbent leadership, the opposition hopes to galvanize their campaign against President Robert Kocharian as an avenue to power. There is no guarantee, however, that once in power, the opposition would be any better, or any more honest, than the government it superseded. More unites the authorities and the opposition than divides them, and the real struggle in Armenia is for power, not democracy or social justice.The fate of democracy in Armenia is, in fact, very much in danger; and the real challenge to Armenian national security comes from within, not from any external threat. And as in the case of much of the Caucasus, the Armenian people remain hostage to the petty politics and shortsighted governance of their so-called leaders. In many ways, both the state and the opposition are seeking to rule out of self-interest, instead of seeking to govern in the national interest. Moreover, the Armenian leadership, through its use of harsh repression, mass detentions, and the arrogant demonstration of its ""disdain for democracy,"" is actually only legitimizing the politics of the opposition while undercutting its own, waning legitimacy and authority.But the most important point is that the true test of the stability and legitimacy of the Armenian government rests in its handling of the current crisis. The Armenian government might well be the author of its own demise, by overestimating and overreacting to the perceived threat posed by the opposition.",,,

Central and Eastern Europe's waning love affair with the European Union is also discussed, as is political protest in Armenia and the unfortunate parallels between the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPETerry Anderson, a former Associated Press correspondent in the Middle East, was held hostage by Shi'a radicals in Beirut from 1985 to 1991. In a contribution to ""The Wall Street Journal,"" he says the conditions that have allowed chaos and terror to prevail in Iraq are similar to those in Lebanon during his captivity, including the ""collapse of central government, the lack of a national army [and] the weakness of police and other security agencies.""He says a contributing factor is the ""inadequacy of military power, no matter how well-trained, motivated and brave the soldiers."" U.S.-led forces cannot simply pull out of Iraq, as they did ""in Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Vietnam."" But the United States ""also cannot dictate the terms and form of an Iraqi government or society. If both Shi'ite and Sunni leaders cannot impose order on their own communities, including the radicals, if they are not willing to use the power they have as religious and political leaders to condemn and bring a halt to these terrible crimes against the innocent, what chance can there be for a stable, even mildly democratic Iraq? And how long can we stay committed to that goal as the death toll among soldiers and civilians mounts?""The recent spate of civilian hostage taking is intended ""to produce fear and humiliation."" But Anderson says, ""it is also a symptom of a confused, ineffective policy and a chaotic, deteriorating situation in Iraq. And that is just as frightening.""THE NEW YORK TIMESAn editorial today says the possible return of Vladimir Meciar to the top spot in Slovak politics ""is unfortunately not an isolated event in Eastern and Central Europe."" Meciar, Slovakia's ""discredited"" former prime minister, will face off against his onetime aide in a 17 April runoff for the presidency.The paper says politicians ""espousing nationalism, ethnic bigotry, overly simplistic economic programs and a rejection of all things European are gaining ground around the region."" Poles, Slovaks, Romanians, and their regional neighbors are increasingly receptive ""to demagogic pitches because they feel betrayed by pro-Europe reformers.""As post-Soviet governments have privatized state-owned companies and cut back the welfare state to meet the budget reforms required by EU membership, some of the reforms have been ""needlessly harsh on the poor."" Widespread feelings of resentment are then exploited by politicians. It's easy to understand why the love affair with Europe is on the wane, the paper says. ""For a dozen years, joining the Union was held out to Eastern Europeans as the ultimate reward for reforming their ways. It turns out that the reward will be doled out in installments."" Farmers in the new member countries will receive a fraction of the agricultural subsidies now given to EU members. Citizens of accession nations will also not yet be allowed to work anywhere in the EU, due to a seven-year moratorium on the east-to-west movement of labor. Central European nations still lack the strong democratic institutions that can keep ""authoritarian-minded politicians"" in check. ""The New York Times"" warns that the rise of Euroskeptic, ""protest politicians"" in Central Europe ""can do lasting damage in nations still finding their way."" THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE""Inspired by Georgia's 'Rose Revolution,' Armenians are also demanding regime change,"" writes David Phillips of the Council on Foreign Relations in ""The Wall Street Journal Europe."" ""Thousands of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators have gathered in Yerevan's Freedom Square in recent days. The government arrested hundreds and is threatening violence if protesters march on the presidential palace.""The ""corrupt and inept"" administration of President Robert Kocharian has turned Armenians' apathy to anger, he says. People, especially the youth, are frustrated by the lack of opportunities. ""To avoid a bloody conflict, an internationally supervised referendum should be held to determine whether a majority want to recall [Kocharian]."" Phillips says the United States ""should help Armenia manage the next phase of its troubled transition to democracy,"" which would be ""[consistent] with its support for reform in Eastern Europe and emerging post-Soviet states."" He writes: ""While making clear that it will not tolerate violence against pro-democracy demonstrators in Freedom Square, Washington can help broker a solution to Armenia's political impasse by encouraging an agreement between the government and opposition to hold a referendum within three months.""THE BOSTON GLOBEWriting in ""The Boston Globe,"" columnist H.D.S. Greenway says the parallels between the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and Israel's presence in the West Bank and Gaza ""[grow] more striking every day."" ""Both the Israeli and American administrations like to say that it isn't occupation that's the problem. It is simply terrorism, they say."" But while terrorism is a factor, ""the central issue in the territories that Israel occupies is the Israeli occupation, and always has been,"" he says. ""The vast majority of Arabs see little difference between the two struggles. Whether it be Americans or Israelis supported by Americans, it is Arabs who are living and dying under the occupations.""But the two occupations are also different in key ways, Greenway says. The Americans in Iraq ""are trying to get out as quickly as they can and turn the country over to its inhabitants."" In contrast, the current Israeli government ""hopes to keep as much of the occupied territories as it can."" And whereas the U.S.-led coalition is seeking an Iraqi-led government administration it can negotiate with, ""the government of Ariel Sharon has done everything in its power to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the symbols of Palestinian nationalism -- and then he says he has no negotiating partner."" Greenway says it is ""curious, given Israel's failure to bring peace and stability to the West Bank and Gaza, that the U.S. military would seek to emulate Israeli tactics."" And yet Israelis are now training U.S. forces in counterinsurgency strategy. Meanwhile, the Iraqi rebellion grows more widespread by the day. THE WASHINGTON POST""The Washington Post's"" Dan Balz says U.S. President George W. Bush was ""unapologetic"" as he answered questions at a rare news conference last night. Bush ""steadfastly refused to admit mistakes and passed up opportunities to explain what it will take to achieve his goal of a free and stable Iraq.""It was soon clear that the president's aim was not to provide new details, consider a shift in policy, ""or acknowledge any rethinking of his decisions in the face of recent setbacks. Instead, it was to restate his determination to stay the course and to argue anew that the war in Iraq will make America more secure."" But Bush repeatedly sidestepped ""pointed questions about his policies and was better at describing his vision of a democratic Iraq than in explaining how he will overcome the mounting obstacles to achieve that vision.""The U.S. president came under pressure to show ""that he has a plan for success. On that score, his performance left more questions than answers."" Several times he seemed to defer policy decisions to other officials. Asked about whether the United States would have to commit more troops in Iraq, Bush said it would be up to the generals on the ground. When asked to what authority the U.S. coalition would transfer power on 30 June, Bush said it would be up to UN special representative Lakhdar Brahimi to put together a ruling coalition that is acceptable to all Iraqis. And when questioned about how long U.S. forces might have to stay in the country, he replied in mere platitudes: ""[As] long as necessary and not one day more.""",,,

The protesters were demanding the departure of President Robert Kocharian, whom they accuse of usurping power through election fraud. Prague, 13 April 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Political confrontation between Armenian President Robert Kocharian and his rivals took a violent twist today when special police forces broke up an opposition rally in the center of Yerevan. The operation started at 02:00 local time (23:00 Prague time) a few dozen meters away from parliament and the U.S. embassy.Speaking live from the scene, RFE/RL's Yerevan bureau correspondent Hrach Melkumian said special police forces -- waving truncheons and throwing blank grenades -- charged up to 3,000 demonstrators on Marshal Baghramian Avenue, the Armenian capital's main thoroughfare.""People are panicking and are running down Marshal Baghramian Avenue. Police are using water cannons. They have taken away the barbed wire that was in front of the parliament building and started charging the demonstrators,"" Melkumian said. ""We saw these water cannons coming toward us and they starting drenching us. Then special police forces started throwing [blank] grenades at the crowd. We heard explosions and ran away in panic.""Yesterday, some 10,000 protesters were stopped by police on Marshal Baghramian Avenue while marching toward Kocharian's office. No violence was reported then. Approximately one-third of the demonstrators decided to camp there for the night, turning the protest into an improvised open-air music festival.As soon as the security raid started, opposition supporters spread out in various directions and attempted to break through the police cordon. Some found refuge in smaller streets, others in private houses nearby.Police today confirmed the operation, saying only that several people were injured and others detained during the night raid.Armenia's Noyan Tapan news agency today quotes Yerevan city health officials as saying 16 demonstrators were hospitalized. Armenian state television showed pictures of policemen being assaulted by people identified as protesters and security officers receiving medical treatment. It gave no details of civilian injuries.Armenian private media say several journalists were among the detainees.In comments broadcast on state-controlled television today, Interior Ministry spokesman Sayat Shirinian accused the protesters of provoking security forces.""Police repeatedly warned demonstrators that their unlawful actions would be met with adequate reaction if they were to continue. But, despite this, the transgressors went on for quite a long time with their antisocial actions. On top of this, in response to [our] warnings, they started moving menacingly toward police forces,"" Shirinian said. Shirinian said protesters assaulted security officers with stones and petrol bombs while shouting antigovernment slogans and calling for the violent overthrow of the existing regime. The opposition denies these claims. One female demonstrator, speaking to RFE/RL, described the security crackdown. She said the streetlights went out suddenly and that the police moved in without prior warning.""We saw these water cannons coming toward us and they starting drenching us. Then special police forces started throwing [blank] grenades at the crowd. We heard explosions and ran away in panic. They started chasing us with truncheons,"" she said. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) gave a mixed assessment of the overnight unrest. In comments made to RFE/RL's Armenian Service, Ambassador Vladimir Pryakhin suggested that both protesters and police forces were to blame for the violence.""We don't share the opinion that the demonstration was purely peaceful, because all sorts of provocative statements were being made and stones were being thrown [at police forces]. But that's not the point. We are against any kind of violence, and we conveyed our concerns with this regard personally to [President Kocharian],"" Pryakhin said.RFE/RL's Yerevan Bureau reports that the offices of Armenia's main opposition parties were raided during the night and several activists detained. Some, such as lawmaker Shavarsh Kocharian of the Justice (Artarutyun) alliance, were released shortly after.None of the main opposition leaders was detained.Speaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service early today, National Unity Party Chairman Artashes Geghamian said he was among the protesters on Marshal Baghramian Avenue and that he escaped with only slight injuries.""Everything was carefully planned to sow panic among people. [Police] started beating protesters indiscriminately with truncheons, regardless of who they were -- women, children, or old people. I went to a group of policemen and told them: 'I am Geghamian. Beat me up if you want.' Strangely enough, they hit me only twice and let me go,"" Geghamian said. Yesterday's march marked the culmination of four days of anti-Kocharian protests led by the Justice alliance and the National Unity Party.Justice and National Unity have accused Kocharian and the three parties in the coalition government of rigging last year's presidential and legislative elections and insist his leadership be put to a national vote of confidence.Kocharian denies any wrongdoing. Police today prevented Justice leader Stepan Demirchian from giving a planned press conference. Representatives of the three coalition partners are due to meet with Kocharian to discuss the political situation.In a bid to defuse the mounting political tension, the Dashnaktsutyun Armenian Revolutionary Federation -- one of the three partners in the ruling coalition -- last week proposed that Justice and its allies have a say in domestic affairs through the National Security Council.However, the opposition rejected the offer.In what is seen by some as a sign of possible cracks in the country's top leadership, lawmakers of Dashnaktsutyun and the two other coalition partners -- the Republican Party and Rule of Law (Orinats Yerkir) -- unexpectedly walked out of yesterday's parliamentary session.Dashnaktsutyun parliamentarian Vahan Hovanessian justified the boycott by saying all three coalition partners wanted to avoid possible violence between their supporters and anti-Kocharian street protesters.The move was greeted skeptically by the Justice leadership, but was welcomed by National Unity party leader Geghamian, who said it signals the end of Kocharian's rule.In comments made to RFE/RL's Armenian Service today, Geghamian said the opposition remains undeterred, despite the overnight crackdown.""This once again proves that Kocharian cannot stay in power and must go,"" he said.Meanwhile, Armenian authorities have cleaned up Marshal Baghramian Avenue and blocked Yerevan's central Freedom Square, the main venue for opposition rallies.Whether the opposition will be able to stage further antigovernment rallies in the coming days remains unclear.Related Stories:Government Threatens Opposition With Criminal ProsecutionPolitical Standoff Deepens As Opposition Snubs Government Offers",,,0

The report concludes that Uzbekistan is one of the most repressive countries in the world. It also says democratic efforts in Kyrgyzstan have stalled, as they have in Armenia and Ukraine. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are described as having authoritarian systems. Prague, 7 April 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Freedom House, an organization that monitors democracy around the world, today published a list of countries that it claims need help to achieve democracy -- or to further improve it.The New York-based group says its list of 30 countries is the first of its kind. It is aimed not just at criticizing the countries named but also at drawing the international community's attention to the fact that they need assistance.In presenting the report -- called ""Countries at the Crossroads"" -- Freedom House's Executive Director Jennifer Windsor said ""these countries are at key transition points and to ignore their needs creates a risk of both individual backsliding and regional democratic deterioration.""The list includes Afghanistan and Pakistan; the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan; in the Caucasus, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia; and in Europe, Ukraine. Several Arab states are also mentioned, such as Bahrain, Qatar, and Yemen.-- In Afghanistan, the report finds that the ""rule of the gun largely supersedes the rule of law."" It says that extra military support is urgently needed to stabilize the country outside the capital Kabul, and that the rights of Afghan women remain at Taliban-era levels in some regions.-- In Pakistan, it says the growing role of the military in government and civil life is a major obstacle to democratic reform, and that promises of reform have not so far shown results.-- In Kazakhstan, the report finds an authoritarian system with limited scope for political competition.-- Kyrgyzstan, it says, has experienced initial democratic openings that have since stalled or eroded.-- The report sees Uzbekistan as being among the most politically repressive states in the world, having perpetrated what it calls ""gross violations"" of human rights and religious freedoms.Turning to the Caucasus, the Freedom House report finds that:-- In Armenia, the limited democratic reforms that were undertaken have gradually eroded, and stalled, and are in danger of complete reversal.-- In Georgia, before November's ouster of President Eduard Shevardnadze, the situation was rated the same as in Armenia. -- In Azerbaijan, there is an authoritarian system with limited scope for political competition. -- In Ukraine, the limited democratic reforms that were undertaken have gradually eroded, and stalled, and are in danger of complete reversal.

It set criteria against which Uzbekistan's performance could be measured.""The environment in Uzbekistan has been particularly challenging. So we set seven benchmarks. And we sought for Uzbekistan to demonstrate progress on these benchmarks. The extent to which they made progress would determine the extent to which we continue to invest in the country,"" Hiday said.The watchdog organization Human Rights Watch today praised the EBRD's decision, calling it ""unprecedented"" and ""principled,"" and describing Uzbekistan's rights record as ""appalling.""Human Rights Watch spokeswoman Vanessa Saenan said in Brussels that the EBRD should apply its benchmark system to other countries, as well.""There are several other countries out there, particularly in Central Asia and the Caucasus, where a similar approach to that taken with respect to Uzbekistan would be warranted,"" Saenan said.Another Human Rights Watch spokeswoman, Veronika Leila in Geneva, listed those countries, saying such benchmarking could become a standard method for measuring progress in democratic and economic reforms.""It would be Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan. In the South Caucasus, we are talking about Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. In Europe, it would not be unwarranted to take a similar approach with respect to Ukraine. So we are really hoping that the [EBRD], after this experience with Uzbekistan, will become more forceful and serious about its political mandate, as it has really demonstrated that it is able to 'operationalize', if you wish, its political mandate, which makes clear that it was set up to engage those countries in the region which do respect democracy and human rights,"" Leila said.Leila called on the United States and the European Union to take a harder line with countries like Uzbekistan, which are allies but which do not observe human rights. She noted that the U.S. government must soon issue its periodic certifications for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, confirming that they are making progress on rights commitments so that aid can be continued.She said these two countries are plainly not making progress.Political analyst Heather Grabbe of the Centre for European Reform in London said that much will depend on what the United States does.""I think the key question is what happens to U.S. policy -- for how long the U.S. is going to go on supporting authoritarian regimes in Central Asia while trying to spread democracy in the Middle East? It doesn't really make sense, and obviously the U.S. agenda has a huge impact on the role of the international organizations,"" Grabbe said.Grabbe said it's an important moment for international donors to consider the conditions they attach to their financing. But she also said there was a persistent lack of consensus within the international community on how to deal with repressive regimes.

The announcement came as several opposition activists were being detained in connection with an investigation into recent anti-Kocharian rallies across the country. Prague, 6 April 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Addressing reporters in Yerevan yesterday, the leader of the opposition Justice (Artarutyun) alliance, Stepan Demirchian, said he and his allies were calling supporters to massively demonstrate against President Kocharian in Yerevan on 9 April. Demirchian said the planned rally was set to mark the beginning of a massive nationwide anti-government campaign.Justice, which has been regularly boycotting parliamentary sessions in recent months, accuses the Armenian leader of ""usurping power"" and ""clamping down on freedom of expression."" At the core of the dispute are last year's presidential and legislative polls, which saw the victory of Kocharian and his allies. Justice and other opposition groups claim the vote was rigged and insist that the president be put to a national vote of confidence. The government has denied any wrongdoing in the elections. Anxious to avoid a political crisis over the disputed elections, Armenia's Constitutional Court last year signaled the constitution could, in principle, be amended in a way that would allow for a national referendum on confidence. But government supporters in the National Assembly (parliament) rejected the idea, saying it had no legal basis. One of the three partners in the ruling coalition, the Dashnaktsutyun Armenian Revolutionary Federation, yesterday demanded that the opposition cease to question Kocharian's legitimacy. In return, the nationalist party said, Justice and its allies should be given seats in the National Security Council to have a say in domestic affairs.A Dashnaktsutyun statement said only dialogue would help prevent what it called ""open confrontation."" But Justice leader Demirchian yesterday rejected the offer, saying the opposition would accept nothing less than the confidence vote.""How could we possibly talk about dialogue when opposition members are being arrested? Arrests are actions inherent with a junta. A real dialogue would have been to call for a national referendum on confidence [in Kocharian]. However, there is still room for introducing constitutional amendments that would pave the way for such a referendum,"" Demirchian said. Demirchian went on to say the opposition was determined to pursue its anti-Kocharian campaign regardless of offers made on behalf of the government and despite counter-steps taken by the authorities.""I understand the fears of Dashnaktsutyun. The situation in the country is indeed tense. But the opposition has never asked for any government post,"" Demirchian said. ""What we want is that constitutional order in the country be restored."" On 31 March, the Prosecutor'-General's Office in Yerevan launched criminal proceedings against Justice and its allies, which it blamed for a series of recent unsanctioned rallies that purportedly called for a violent change of regime and using what it said was ""offensive language"" against senior government officials.The Prosecutor-General's Office yesterday said Suren Sureniants of the opposition Hanrapetutyun (Republic) party -- a leading member of the Justice alliance -- was arrested in connection with the investigation. Hanrapetutyun spokesman Artak Hakobian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that Sureniants was arrested in a village nearby Yerevan and brought to the capital for questioning. The Prosecutor-General's Office said no formal charges had been brought against him yet.Hakobian also said opposition activists were being detained in many Armenian regions.""Today we've been receiving phone calls from our people in Yeghvard, Charentsavan, Stepanavan, Vanadzor, and Gyumri. People are being either summoned or taken to the police. Some of them are being released, some are being put into custody,"" Hakobian said.Addressing reporters in Yerevan today, police chief Nerses Nazarian said nearly 40 opposition activists have been apprehended. He did not say whether charges were brought against them or how long they would remain in custody. Meanwhile, representatives of ruling coalition parties have justified the detentions.Dashnaktsutyun member Vahan Hovanessian yesterday said authorities ""have the right to take necessary steps to isolate people transporting weapons and other instruments that could be used in possible clashes."" Republican Party member Tigran Torosian told RFE/RL's Armenian Service that harassment of the opposition will stop once it ceases its anti-Kocharian campaign. Opposition activists yesterday took to the streets of central Yerevan to demand that the president step down and that a national referendum be organized.Estimates put the number of participants at between 3,000 and 8,000.Media reports say unidentified youths smashed cameras belonging to several journalists at the rally near the Matenadaran Library. Also, eggs and stones were thrown at the protesters from nearby balconies. No serious clashes were reported, however. National Unity party leader Artashes Geghamian, who led yesterday's protest, claimed the authorities were unwilling to compromise with the opposition.""Had authorities called off police from the Matenadaran area, agreed to come with us to meet with voters, or shown their goodwill [in any other from], that would have been a starting point for cooperation. But instead, they attempted to close bridges and roads leading to Yerevan,"" Geghamian said.Despite uneasy relations stemming from last year's presidential polls, Geghamian and Justice leader Demirchian recently forged an alliance aimed at securing Kocharian's ouster.

But drug-enforcement officials say the South Caucasus -- strategically located between Asia and Europe -- is also a major transit point for narcotics. Corruption, instability, and separatist conflicts are all cited as being behind the region's rise in smuggling. Prague, 9 March 2004 (RFE/RL) -- On 1 March, the U.S. State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) released its annual review of progress in the global fight against drug trafficking.The INL's ""International Narcotics Control Strategy Report"" praises recent efforts made by the three South Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in curbing illicit drug trade. The three nations are all signatories of the three existing United Nations drug-control conventions. Since 2001 they have been engaged in the UN-sponsored Southern Caucasus Anti-Drug program, also known as SCAD. In addition, all three have taken steps to curb trafficking and prevent domestic drug use. Armenia last year implemented a law on narcotics and psychotropic substances and is currently working on a draft bill to combat money laundering. Also last year, then-Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze signed into law an anti-laundering bill that was strengthened last month by the country's new leadership. Azerbaijan is currently working on a similar legal package that could be approved by parliament by the end of this year. ""The money that is generated by drug smuggling is being used to purchase weapons and ammunition. It also serves to finance these separatist regimes.""Yet, the INL believes a lot more remains for these countries to do in the fight against drug trafficking, especially since they are located in an area that is an important transit route for illicit trade to Western Europe. The U.S. agency expresses particular concern regarding Azerbaijan, which it says has emerged as a drug-trafficking hub after armed conflicts in former Yugoslavia disrupted traditional routes linking Iran to Western Europe via Turkey and the Balkans.International experts believe heroin represents up to 80 percent of the illicit drugs transited through the region. Opium and marijuana are also smuggled.Mezahir Efendiyev is Azerbaijan's national coordinator for the SCAD program. He told RFE/RL a number of factors are contributing to the region's emergence as a major drug-trafficking route. ""If one takes into account, on the one hand, the fact that the three South Caucasus countries are geographically located between Asia and Europe and, on the other hand, the fact that the CIS states represent a major market for heroin, it is natural that this route should suit the drug mafias,"" he said. ""This route, which originates in Afghanistan and goes to Europe through the South Caucasus and the rest of the CIS, is a very easy one. In addition, these countries acceded to independence roughly 10 years ago and they lack the modern technology that would enable them to prevent drug transit through the South Caucasus area."" Pavel Pachta works with the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a Vienna-based body that monitors implementation of UN drug conventions worldwide. He says the industrial South Caucasus area -- which lies at the crossroads of the so-called Balkan Route and its sister ""Silk Road Route"" linking Afghanistan to Europe through Central Asia -- is important not only as a transit point for drugs, but also as a potential provider of chemicals for Afghan-based heroin producers.""The countries of the Caucasus are very close to these routes and, undoubtedly, there have been and there are attempts to use [them] for smuggling. On the one hand, drugs are coming from Afghanistan to the markets where there is a demand for them. On the other hand, chemicals are going in the [opposite] direction, because to manufacture heroin you need chemicals -- for example, acetic anhydride -- and these chemicals are smuggled into Afghanistan,"" Pachta said.The INCB, which released its own annual report on 3 March, notes Afghanistan's production of opiates increased by 8 percent last year. The report blames authorities in neighboring Turkmenistan -- a major transit point for Afghan-made narcotics -- for failing to cooperate with the international community in the fight against drug trafficking. International experts say Afghan-produced drugs reach Azerbaijan, the easternmost of the Caucasus republics, through two main routes. One goes directly through Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea. Another crosses the 611-kilometer-long land border between Azerbaijan and Iran. A third suspected route is the flight path recently opened between Kabul and Baku, although the INL says there is so far no evidence to support that theory.Widespread corruption and the various armed conflicts that have plagued the South Caucasus since the late 1980s both contribute to making the region a haven for illicit trafficking. Georgia and Azerbaijan have each lost at least a quarter of their territory to separatist conflicts. Drug-enforcement officials say the self-proclaimed governments now leading these breakaway regions are suspected of profiteering from illegal trade, including drug trafficking. Authorities in Azerbaijan claim the breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh has become not only a favored transit route for drugs smuggled from Iran, but also a major heroin production center. Mezahir Efendiyev of the UN-sponsored SCAD program says international drug experts have been barred from Karabakh by local rulers, and are thus unable to verify these claims. He also says a significant section of Azerbaijan's southern border has been under the control of ethnic Armenian troops for the past decade, making it even more difficult for the Azerbaijani government to fight drug trafficking from Iran. Paata Nozadze is SCAD's national coordinator for Georgia. He says separatist conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have created similar problems for the central government in Tbilisi. ""These so-called hot spots, or uncontrolled areas, perfectly suit drug traffickers,"" he said. ""The money that is generated by drug smuggling is being used to purchase weapons and ammunition. It also serves to finance these separatist regimes. This situation perfectly suits drug traffickers because all they have to do is strike a deal with local governments. Elsewhere they would have to make separate arrangements with border guards, customs officers, policemen, or state security officials. For them these conflict zones are much more advantageous.""Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on 11 February described Abkhazia as a drug-trafficking corridor, prompting a swift protest from the separatist leadership in Sukhum. Also last month, the recently elected South Caucasus leader -- who based his campaign on pledges to fight crime and corruption -- launched a security sweep to disarm Georgian guerrillas based in the western Samegrelo (Mingrelia) region, an area that borders Abkhazia. The so-called Forest Brothers group is suspected of controlling smuggling activities in the area in conjunction with Abkhaz groups and Russian peacekeepers posted on the other side of the demarcation line that separates the province from the rest of Georgia.Narcotics reach Georgia from Azerbaijan, South Ossetia, Turkey, and, to a lesser extent, from Armenia. A report prepared in 2002 for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency says illicit drugs are then transited either through Abkhazia, the Black Sea port of Poti, or Batumi, the capital of the autonomous region of Adjaria. From there, they travel on to Ukraine and Romania.Only a small percentage of illegal drugs transiting through the South Caucasus region are seized by law enforcement agencies. In Azerbaijan, which for two years has been receiving U.S. counternarcotics assistance through the Freedom Support Act, the Interior Ministry last year conducted a nationwide operation against drug traffickers and local producers of poppy and cannabis plants. SCAD program coordinator Efendiyev says that although Azerbaijan has shown some progress in combating drug trafficking, it still has a long way to go. ""Only 10 to 15 percent of drugs that go through Azerbaijan are seized by our law enforcement agencies,"" he said. ""In 2003, they seized over 211 kilograms of narcotic substances and destroyed more than 290 [tons] of narcotic plants. By comparison, no plantations were destroyed in Armenia and, in Georgia, only 34 tons were destroyed."" This month's report by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs notes that although corruption permeates Azerbaijan's law enforcement sector, there is no evidence that local police officers are participating in the illicit production or distribution of narcotics. By contrast, in neighboring Georgia, a number of police officers were recently arrested and charged with involvement in the narcotics trade. The amount of drugs seized in that country remains particularly low. Georgia's SCAD coordinator Paata Nozadze told RFE/RL: ""The figures for 2003 are very small. They include only 3 kilograms of heroin, 8.3 kilograms of opium, and 42.4 kilograms of marijuana. This is all that has officially been seized. This is very little."" The Georgian expert believes a lack of coordination among the agencies involved in the antinarcotics fight could explain why the amount of illegal drugs seized in the country is so small. But there could be other reasons. A number of counternarcotics officials and policemen suspected of involvement in illicit trade activities were recently arrested in Georgia. This suggests that large volumes of contraband drugs are being unofficially seized, diverted and resold on the fast-expanding local black market. Official statistics say there are just 18,000 drug users in Georgia, a country of roughly 4 million. But independent experts believe the actual number of drug consumers in that country is somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.",,,
,,https://www.rferl.org/a/1051695.html,South Caucasus Is Any Real Progress Being Made In Tackling Corruption ,"February 27, 2004 14:55 GMT",,,"In its latest global corruption survey, the Transparency International nongovernmental watchdog ranked the three South Caucasus states among countries perceived as being the most corrupt. Armenia ranked 78th among 133 countries, while Georgia and Azerbaijan -- countries where the group said corruption is ""pervasive"" -- trailed behind, tied at 124th place. All three regional governments have taken steps that suggest a willingness to address the issue. But how far are they ready to go? Prague, 27 February 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan are required to combat corruption as members of the Council of Europe, but none of them has yet achieved many breakthroughs. All three countries faced various levels of criticism for failing to tackle the issue at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe last month.Anticorruption strategies have followed different patterns in Tbilisi, Yerevan, and Baku.Rena Safaraliyeva heads Transparency Azerbaijan, Transparency International's chapter in Baku. She credits Georgia with being the first country in the region to take anticorruption steps, contrary to the generally accepted idea that former President Eduard Shevardnadze encouraged illicit practices.""If one compares efforts undertaken in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia to fight corruption, one has to admit that Georgia has done much more [than the other two countries] in that direction. Already under President Shevardnadze, the government was combating corruption. Georgia adopted anticorruption legislation and a national anticorruption program. That this did not bring the expected results is a separate issue. But, obviously, attempts were made [to fight corruption]. As far as I know, the new Georgian government intends to fight corruption even more actively than its predecessor. I wish they would achieve some results,"" Safaraliyeva told RFE/RL. ""You can raise public awareness under an authoritarian regime, but that does not really matter.""Shevardnadze was forced to resign last November in the wake of street protests sparked by controversial parliamentary elections. His successor, opposition leader and former Justice Minister Mikheil Saakashvili, has made the elimination of corruption a top priority of his government.Since entering politics in the late 1990s, Saakashvili has built an image as an anticorruption crusader, which largely contributed to his landslide victory in last month's early presidential polls.Saakashvili has launched what he describes as an unprecedented crackdown on corruption. Dozens of state officials and businessmen reportedly linked to the Shevardnadze administration -- including the former president's son-in-law, Giorgi Djokhtaberidze -- have been arrested in a sweep that also includes many middle-ranking civil servants with no known political affiliations.The scope of Saakashvili's anticorruption drive has raised concerns both at home and abroad. Georgian critics claim the new ruling team is primarily interested in eliminating political rivals, while rights activists blame Saakashvili for using heavy-handed methods. Christoph Stefes is an expert on corruption in Georgia and Armenia who teaches political science at the University of Colorado. He told RFE/RL that he, too, has serious doubts about the new Georgian government's anticorruption measures. ""I haven't really seen anything coherent [so far]. I think they're still working on their anticorruption program. What Saakashvili is doing right now, in my opinion, is a political window-dressing [operation]. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin did the same when he went after [such oligarchs as Vladimir] Gusinsky or [Boris] Berezovsky. The Russians loved him for that. [Similarly,] the Georgians love Saakashvili for going after [Shevardnadze's] son-in-law, or former energy and transportation ministers,"" Stefes said. Saakashvili has justified the recent sweep by saying corruption was so ""rampant"" under Shevardnadze that there are no other alternatives. Admitting that arrests are not enough to cope with corruption, the Georgian leader has also suggested raising salaries for policemen and other public officers in a bid to dissuade them from extorting bribes.Parliament on 12 February gave first reading approval to new anticorruption legislation that simplifies criminal procedures in corruption cases, gives broader powers to law-enforcement agencies and sees reduced prison sentences for police informers. Also, Georgian lawmakers on 25 February toughened the existing law on money laundering and voted for the creation of a new police force that would be solely responsible for investigating economic crimes.Transparency's Safaraliyeva warns that programs mainly aimed at castigating corrupt officials are likely to miss their targets. ""I do not know whether steps that are being taken now in Georgia will ultimately prove efficient,"" she said. ""But let's say that if our government were to emphasize punishment for corruption crimes, I would argue that this is not [the] best solution. Punishment cannot be the best solution if it is the only existing method. If a state official has committed a crime, he must be punished, and sentences [for corruption crimes] can be reasonably envisaged retroactively. But if one wants to prevent corruption, then punitive methods are by far not the best ones. The experience of other countries shows that the best way to prevent corruption is to reform public administration from top to bottom."" Stefes of the University of Colorado also believes overly punitive anticorruption tactics are likely to be counterproductive because what they do is ""make corrupt networks look for mutual protection"" against the government's efforts.By contrast, authorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan have adopted lower-profile tactics. The Armenian government on 16 January made public an anticorruption plan aimed at making state institutions more transparent and eliminating red-tape bureaucracy. The plan also includes recommendations to citizens not to yield to requests for bribes at state-run schools and hospitals, as well as rules of conduct for civil servants.But most Armenians are skeptical of the whole scheme, arguing that it lacks any implementation mechanisms and fails to address corruption in many state institutions.Stefes says the Armenian government ignored most anticorruption guidelines set by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, instead emphasizing the necessity of raising public awareness. ""Some fundamental reforms that were suggested -- such as reforming the police for example -- were cut out by the government. Public awareness seems to be OK, but it is also the least touchy [issue],"" he said. ""You can raise public awareness under an authoritarian regime, but that does not really matter. So I think this is a half-hearted kind of reform. It is doing a little bit, but obviously [the government] is not interested in doing much more. For [President Robert] Kocharian, the corrupt system that exists in Armenia is perfect to [win] political support with all these little oligarchs now being in the ruling party and [standing] behind him. That works perfectly.""Stefes further argues that, contrary to Shevardnadze, who had virtually no power to implement his initiatives, Kocharian has enough leverage on the state apparatus to effectively combat corruption. The same goes for Azerbaijan, which has been ruled for more than a decade by the powerful Aliyev family clan.On 13 January, the Azerbaijani parliament approved an anticorruption law, the first of its kind since the country regained independence in 1991. The new legislation, which will come into force only next year, bars state officials from receiving expensive gifts and entering into business activities ""either personally or through proxies."" It also forbids them from holding jobs other than teaching positions and from hiring close relatives. Finally, it obliges public officers to declare their incomes.Safaraliyeva of Transparency said that, despite the law having many shortcomings, ""the fact that it was voted is a positive step."" ""The greatest merit of this [document] is that, for the first time, the notion of corruption as a crime -- or, let's say, as a violation of the law -- appears in the legislation,"" she said. ""Before that, there existed only the notion of bribery in the Criminal Code. But corruption includes a variety of violations of the law. Although it is the most widespread of these violations, bribery is by far not the only form of corruption and, [before parliament voted this text], other forms of corruption were not punishable by law."" Like in Armenia, the public in Azerbaijan views the new legislation with skepticism. Some critics argue President Ilham Aliyev is unlikely to curb corruption unless he changes the government apparatus he inherited from his late father. Others believe no anticorruption campaign can be effective unless the country has an independent judiciary. Safaraliyeva says her group would also have welcomed the inclusion of civil society members on a new anticorruption commission included as part of the government's recent legislative initiative. Yet, the proposal says only the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of power will be represented on that commission. ""From our viewpoint, this is a serious mistake,"" Safaraliyeva said. Stefes agrees that civil society should be involved in the fight against corruption. He cites the modest results achieved by Shevardnadze's anticorruption council -- an advisory body made up of journalists, academics, parliamentarians, and rights campaigners, which was abolished just a few days ago. He says joint action taken by the international community and domestic nongovernmental actors is the best way to force governments to tackle corruption.",,,
