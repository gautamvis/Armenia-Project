It was impossible to verify the report independently, and sporadic famines are commonplace in North Korea, according to experts based in South Korea. A United Nations analysis in 2011 showed that around a third of children were malnourished.
The report from Rimjin-gang/ASIAPRESS said that, based on its own reporting from the region and from contact with North Korean defectors and people crossing the border, a famine hit the North and South Hwanghae provinces in January-May 2012.
""Farming villages in the Hwanghae region, and especially in southern Hwanghae province, play an important part as a base for food supply for not just the army but also for city workers,"" the report, published last week, said.
It cited examples of farmers and laborers in the region, in the southwest of the country, saying that ""about a tenth"" of a work brigade of 60 people in one village had died. Another case cited said that the death rate had been ""30 people out of every 1,000. They say this is 30 times as high as a normal year.""
A report by the U.N. World Food Programme published in November estimated that overall food production rose by 10 percent for the 2012 and 2013 early season harvest, leaving a staple food deficit of 207,000 metric tons - something it said was ""the lowest in many years.""
Despite an improvement in the overall food picture in the North, the need to feed the army and ensure supplies to the capital Pyongyang, the showcase city and core support base for the government, meant it was possible there were regional famines that have not been reported, experts said.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,junk

The offensives in Ramadi, Falluja and Haditha in the western province of Anbar started before dawn, security sources in the three cities said.
Sunni tribes revolted in these areas in late 2013 when Iraq's former prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, moved his forces into the cities to suppress a year-long anti-government protest movement.
Islamic State insurgents then entered the cities and became the dominate force over the course of several months' fighting against the Shi'ite-led government.
Maliki's successor, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, promised last week to end strikes on cities, in order to reduce civilian casualties. Wednesday's attacks were on outlying suburbs of the three cities.
Security sources said the Iraqi Army's 8th division hit areas in western Ramadi with mortars, artillery and rocket fire. Government-aligned Sunni tribal fighters also clashed with Islamic State in Ramadi, leaving eight people dead, a hospital source in Ramadi said.
A suicide car bomb blast destroyed a bridge in Ramadi on Wednesday, killing nine people and cutting off a vital route out of the city to the west, security sources said.
In Falluja, heavy shelling and Iraqi air force strikes hit the al-Sujur district on the edge of the city, killing 12 civilians, medics in Falluja said.

Intelligence reports showed initial assaults killed at least four militants, possibly including a Malaysian, and reportedly wounded the main target, Isnilon Hapilon, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told The Associated Press.
He said that Hapilon apparently managed to flee from an encampment in the mountainous hinterlands of Butig town in southern Lanao del Sur province.
""Army troops are still in hot pursuit,"" Lorenzana said.
Airstrikes targeted Hapilon's group on Wednesday and Thursday. Hundreds of troops, backed by artillery fire, then began pursuing him and other militants from the so-called Maute group in Butig, military chief of staff Gen. Eduardo Ano said.
Hapilon, who is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide with up to $5 million bounty for his capture, moved to Butig from his stronghold on southern Basilan island a month ago to look for a base for his new militant alliance, Ano told The AP.

Turkey is trying to become a more active player in the Near East, voicing ideas which then appear to be alarming, if not dangerous. Complete failure of the foreign policy pushes Ankara to seeking new ways of implementing the “neo-Osmanism”. This, first of all, assumes the endorsement of caliphate and restoration of the following title:
July 28, 2012
PanARMENIAN.Net - “Sultan (given name) Khan, Sovereign of the House of Osman, Sultan of Sultans, Khan of Khans, Commander of the Faithful and Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe, Protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem”, et cetera, et cetera.

This was not just a detailed listing of the sultan titles. Huge army that conquered vast territories in 400 years including Mecca and Medina, now under rule of Al Saudi dynasty, was of major importance for the Ottoman Empire. Establishment of a new caliphate needs an army as well - united Islamic forces, if possible.

Mustafa Kamalak, chairman of the Turkish Saadet (“Felicity”) Party voiced this idea in Morocco last week. Saadet is the hardliner wing of the former Turkish Refah (“Welfare”) Party, the moderate Eurocentric wing of which is now Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Kamalak declared that “Islamic NATO” and Islamic peacekeeping forces need to be established urgently.

“Today’s events in Islamic countries again proved that the former Turkish PM Necmettin Erbakan was right in his urge to create Islamic peacekeeping forces. We heartily welcome the awakening in Islamic states and pray for their success. Still, the Western states are trying to benefit from it. We must first push forward unity and integrity, rather than our conflicts,” Kamalak noted.

Former prime minister of Turkey Necmettin Erbakan is known as author of the “universal caliphate” concept. Ideologically, caliphate bases on Islam, while its martial aspect relies on the independent military-political bloc. Erbakan named this bloc the “Islamic peacekeeping forces” and its supporters - the “Islamic NATO”. The North-Atlantic Alliance is facing hard times now; meanwhile, Turkey is increasingly gaining weight entitling it to come up with such statements. No doubt, Azerbaijan will be the first to join the Islamic NATO in case it does emerge. Baku will definitely attempt to thus settle its issues; otherwise, it will lose the second Karabakh war as well if it relies on its own resources.

It should be noted that the “Islamic NATO” first of all targets the Arab world, which Turkey is eager to attract under the “democracy protection” cover. This “democracy” was quite apparent in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt; tragically, Syria is following the same path.

The “Islamic NATO” will definitely never lack funding: Saudi Arabia and Qatar will gladly undertake the financing of this formation, despite certain theological discrepancy between Sunnis of the Gulf monarchies and Turkey.

However, these obstacles can be overcome: monarchies, particularly Saudi Arabia dominated by Wahhabi branch of Islam will hardly insist on the Sunnism they practice.

The new structure will also try to move away from the West and just ignore Iran. The West may also welcome the new bloc hoping it will help settle the Syrian and Iranian issues. In a word, everybody will be happy.

Just one minor note: is the Arab world willing to see Turkey take the lead of their united forces? The history hints the answer is negative. The thing is that the ideas Ankara is coming with every now and then may once become a reality. So, one has to rely on Saudi Arabia and Qatar in this. Formal support to Erdogan with his sultanic aspirations is one thing, while tolerating, so to say, such a leader of the Islamic world is quite another. Saudi Arabia’s kingdom rightfully believes this to be its prerogative and is not going to step down as yet, “as yet” being the key phrase here...",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,protest

The two officers, who did not appear in court due to ill health, are the first to be tried for a coup in Turkey. Gen Evren, who was also president until 1989, never expressed regret for the coup that led to a wave of executions, torture and disappearances.
Some 600,000 people were detained and 50 executed by hanging in the coup.
Separately on Wednesday, June 18 Turkey's highest court paved the way for the potential retrial of 230 military officers convicted of attempting to topple Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in the so-called 2003 ""Sledgehammer"" plot.
Gen Evren and Gen Sahinkaya were convicted of crimes against the state for setting the stage for army intervention and conducting the coup. It is not yet clear if they will be made to serve the life sentences due to ill health.
Gen Evren's military takeover came to symbolise the military's long-standing dominance over Turkish politics.
But a constitutional clause granting the generals immunity from prosecution was overturned after a referendum in 2010, as part of Prime Minister Erdogan's attempts to rein in the power of the army.
Gen Evren justified the coup by saying it saved the country from descending into anarchy after deadly fighting between political extremists. ""Should we feed them in prison for years instead of hanging them?"" he said in a speech in 1984, defending the decision to hang political activists.
They will immediately appeal against the verdict, their lawyer, Burak Baskale told the Associated Press news agency.

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/170475/,Assad says he doesn’t discount U.S. military attack possibility,9/26/13,Syria,9/25/13,,"Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview broadcast Wednesday, Sept 25, that he does not discount the possibility of a U.S. military attack even though threatened action was forestalled when he agreed to give up chemical weapons.
Assad also said in an interview broadcast by Venezuela's state-run Telesur network that his government has confessions from rebels that they brought chemical weapons into the civil war-wracked nation. According to the broadcast's Spanish dubbing, Assad said all evidence pointed to rebel responsibility for the attack.
He said that Syrian authorities had uncovered chemical arms caches and labs and that the evidence had been turned over to Russia, which brokered the deal that helped persuade U.S. President Barack Obama to pull back from threatened military action over an Aug 21 gas attack that killed civilians in a Damascus suburb.
In a speech at the UN on Tuesday, Obama said he would not use military force to depose Assad. But Washington and Moscow remain at odds on how to hold Syria accountable if it does not live up to its pledge to dismantle its chemical weapons stockpile.
Assad predicted during the 40-minute interview that “terrorists would try to block access of UN inspectors who enter Syria to secure the government's chemical arsenal.”
While Assad said he had evidence that countries including Saudi Arabia were arming Syrian rebels, he said he had no proof that any particular country had supplied them with chemical weapons.
He was also asked about the apparent thaw in relations between the U.S. and Iran, his government's chief patron in the region.
Assad called the development positive but added that he did not consider it to mean that Tehran's leaders trust Washington. He said it was important that the U.S. stop pressuring Iran not to have nuclear technology.
Assad also accused the Obama administration of lying to U.S. citizens by claiming it has proof that Assad's government was responsible for the Aug 21 gas attack.
Interviewed by China's state television CCTV in Damascus on Monday, Assad said he was not concerned about the draft resolution and that China and Russia would ""ensure any excuse for military action against Syria will not stand.""
""I am not concerned. Since its independence, Syria has been committed to all the treaties it has signed. We will honor everything that we have agreed to do. And more importantly, I want to say, by submitting the draft to the UN Security Council, or by urging the U.S. and Russia to agree on a deal, the U.S., France, and Britain are just trying to make themselves winners in a war against a Syria which is their imaginary enemy,"" Assad was quoted as saying.
In an interview on the Fox News television channel earlier this month, Assad said his government would dispose of its chemical weapons arsenal and it would take about a year. ""I think it is a very complicated operation technically and it needs a lot, a lot of money. Some estimated about a billion for the Syrian stockpile,"" he said.
He said the Syrian army was advancing in the area at the time and had no need to fire rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin, as the United States says it did. ""The whole story doesn't even hold together. It's not realistic. So, no, we didn't.

Speaking to Reuters on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Syrian war, Assad's long-serving UN ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said his president was ready to work with the United States and others to combat terrorism in the Middle East.
""We don't want any vacuum in the country that would create chaos such as happened in Libya and Iraq and ... Afghanistan,"" he said. ""President Assad can deliver because he is a strong president. He rules over a strong institution, which is the Syrian army. He has resisted pressure for four years.""
""He is the man who can deliver any solution,"" he added.
Britain and France have rejected calls to restore ties with the Assad government. U.S. officials say there is no shift in their policy regarding Assad, even as their focus is fighting Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot which is also an enemy of Damascus. ""We have been open for cooperation (with the U.S.),"" Ja’afari said. ""They don't want it.""
Some European Union countries that withdrew their ambassadors from Syria are saying privately it is time for more communication with Damascus, diplomats said in February.
Diplomats say the calls have come from or would be supported by countries including Sweden, Denmark, Romania, Bulgaria, Austria and Spain, as well as the Czech Republic, which did not withdraw its ambassador. Norway and Switzerland, which are outside the EU, are also supportive.
Such countries say that the threat from Islamic State has made Assad the lesser of two evils, seeing a need to re-engage with Damascus as a potential ally against the extremists, according to the diplomats.
U.S. officials at the United Nations did not have an immediate comment on Ja'afari's latest statements.
They noted recent comments to the Security Council by Washington's UN ambassador Samantha Power rejecting the argument that countries should partner with Damascus to more effectively fight extremists.
The United States and other Western powers have condemned Assad for widespread human rights violations since the uprising against his government began in 2011.

As the U.S. and its allies furiously work to train thousands more troops for the daunting task of retaking Iraq's second largest city, Islamic State fighters are waging a diversion campaign of bloody suicide attacks in Baghdad and elsewhere.
Their aim is to force Iraq's already overburdened security forces to spread even thinner to protect the capital and other cities rather than prepare the Mosul operation.
Iraq's answer to that has been a plan to build a wall around the capital. Meanwhile, the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqis are struggling to protect pockets of territory that have been recaptured from the extremists.
""Mosul will be very complicated, it will be a mix of forces and it will be very important to ensure it's well planned,"" Brett McGurk, President Barack Obama's envoy to the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS, said Saturday, March 5.
U.S. Army Col. Christopher Garver, a coalition spokesman, put it more bluntly. ""The forces that are going to conduct that assault into the city, they're not in place yet.""
The northern city of Mosul, once home to more than a million people, was the biggest prize captured by IS when it swept over much of Iraq's north and west in the summer of 2014 and declared a ""caliphate"" across those lands and territory it holds in Syria. While Iraqi forces have clawed back some territory in the past year, retaking Mosul is considered crucial for breaking the jihadis' back in the country. Estimates of the number of IS fighters in Mosul vary from a few thousand to ""not more than 10,000,"" according to the coalition.
The Iraqi military is still struggling to regroup. When Mosul fell to IS, more than a third of the military disintegrated as thousands of soldiers shed their uniforms and dropped their weapons to flee.

The power base of executed former president Saddam's clan, Tikrit is the focus of a counter-offensive against Islamic State by more than 20,000 troops and Shi'ite Muslim militias known as Hashid Shaabi, backed by local Sunni Muslim tribes.
If Iraq's Shi'ite-led government is able to retake Tikrit it would be the first city clawed back from the Sunni insurgents and would give it momentum in the next, pivotal stage of the campaign - to recapture Mosul, the largest city in the north.
A Reuters photographer saw dozens of families, who earlier fled al-Alam to escape Islamic State rule, return to the town, celebrating and slaughtering sheep for the victorious forces.
""I announce officially that the town is under the total control of security forces, the Hashid Shaabi (Popular Mobilization) units and local tribal fighters,"" said local mayor Laith al-Jubouri.
""We rejoice in this victory and we want al-Alam to be the launchpad for the liberation of Tikrit and Mosul,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
Mosul in the far north is the largest city held by the ultra-radical Islamic State, who now rule a self-declared cross-border caliphate in Sunni regions of Syria and Iraq.
But the ultra-radical group over the past few months has gradually lost ground in Iraq to the army, Shi'ite militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces, backed by air strikes carried out by a U.S.-led coalition of mainly Western and allied Arab states.
The United States says Baghdad did not seek aerial backup from the coalition in the Tikrit campaign. Instead, support on the ground has come from neighboring Iran, Washington's longtime regional rival, which backs the Shi'ite militias and has sent an elite Revolutionary Guard commander to oversee part of the battle.

The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which cares for Palestinian refugees, said it had begun distributing 900 food parcels in Yarmouk camp, its biggest delivery there yet.
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said the aid was the first to reach Yarmouk since January 21 when 138 food parcels were sent in. Each parcel can feed a family of five for 10 days, meaning the needs of the population still far outstrip aid deliveries.
""We hope to continue and increase substantially the amount of aid being delivered,"" said Gunness. ""With each passing hour their need increases.""
Syria's state news agency SANA confirmed the aid delivery, saying Yarmouk's residents were ""held hostage by armed terrorist groups"" - its usual description of rebel forces.
UNRWA had blamed the authorities for preventing its convoy from reaching the neighborhood on Sunday. Two weeks earlier, aid convoys turned back after a government escort was fired on.
Some 15 people are reported to have died from malnutrition in Yarmouk, originally an impoverished Palestinian refugee camp which now houses 18,000 Palestinians, as well as some Syrians.
Opposition activists say the government is using hunger as a weapon of war. Damascus accuses rebels of firing on aid convoys and says it fears food and medicine will go to armed groups.
At peace talks between the two sides in Geneva, the United Nations is trying to negotiate passage for an aid convoy for 2,500 people also under siege in the Old City of Homs.
Gaining access for relief groups to reach an estimated 250,000 people trapped by fighting in Yarmouk, Homs and other areas is seen as a test for the peace talks, which began last week and have not yet produced substantive results.

Russia may join the countries where the public denial of certain historical facts will be regarded as criminal offence. ""Certain historical facts"" have been indicated by the innovation initiator, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma Boris Gryzlov. The point is in criminal prosecution of those justifying the crime committed by Nazis during the years of the Great Patriotic War. According to the commentator of ""Mayak"" Radio Station Andrey Svetenko, the Armenian Genocide committed in the Ottoman Empire should also be ranked among such historical facts.
September 27, 2007
PanARMENIAN.Net - ""One of the relevant examples is the adoption of the law by the French Parliament on criminal liability for denying the Armenian Genocide committed in 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. However the point is that the citizens of Turkey in most cases don't recognize the Armenian Genocide as a Historical Fact. They say that there had been no persecutions on ethnic grounds, but liquidation of traitors, who had assisted to the enemy; the Russian army during the war in some way, although there were more than million of them, including babies and helpless old men and women. This is indeed negation of negation. And in this regard Gryzlov's suggestion is a step towards the right path. Facts are facts. One shouldn't put up with someone who tries to call black another color,"" assures Svetenko. 

The initiative of the Russian legislators is quite understandable and even predictable. On the one hand, it is their strong desire to be integrated into the system of the global values and respect to the human rights, and on the other hand, it is the necessity to recognize the historical facts, which have not been spoken about in the Soviet Times. It is no secret that in the USSR mentioning the Armenian Genocide committed in the Ottoman Empire has been banned for a rather long time and that only in 1965 under the pressure of the Armenian Community of the Armenian SSR ""it was allowed"" to commemorate April 24 in honor of the victims of the Armenian Genocide. 

It's hard to guess whether the exact reason of the idea of bringing to account those denying the historical fact was the French bill, the desire to suppress the growing xenophobia in the Russian society or something else. The French bill anticipates 5-year-imprisonment and a 45.000-euro-fine for the denial of the Armenian Genocide. If suddenly Russia passes a similar bill, the sum of the fine and the imprisonment may make certain people think twice before denying a fact. It is worth mentioning, that in the number of countries the denial of the Holocaust is also subject to criminal penalty. 

As for France, things are more or less clear here. According to the political scientist Karen Bekaryan, by passing the bill France once again reminded the world where the routs of the democracy lay. In this very case the French parliamentarians were guided by the public opinion, which is not pro-Armenian but anti-Turkish. The thing is not in the Armenians, the thing is in the Turks. As it is known, France is categorically against Turkey's integration into EU, against expansion, against the European Constitution. And France is not alone in it. Europe won't be able to digest the Islamic country with the population of 80 million people. The same may be said about Russia, which has more problems with Muslim population, which according to some assessments will overweight the Russians in the nearest future. 

It is quite possible that the idea of the Speaker of the Russian State Duma will so remain a happy intention, but in any case the progress in considering the Genocide as evil against

Sudan's army has been fighting SPLM-North rebels in the state since June last year, shortly before South Sudan seceded from Sudan, but the South Kordofan capital Kadugli has been largely isolated from the fighting until the past month.
Khartoum accuses South Sudan of backing the rebels, an allegation Western diplomats find credible despite Juba's denials.
SPLM-North spokesman Arnu Lodi said rebels shelled the military's headquarters in Kadugli with mortars and other heavy weapons late on Monday, Nov 5, in response to air strikes and ground attacks against their positions. Witnesses also reported shells falling in the city.
Sudan's military spokesman did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. Events in Sudan's border states are hard to verify as the government rarely allows foreign media to travel there.
Fighting in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile border states has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes since it broke out last year.
Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis in the regions as food stocks dwindle. Rebels have shelled Kadugli several times in the last month, including an attack during a visit by Sudan's defense minister.
South Sudan seceded from Sudan under a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army North rebels fought as part of the southern rebel army during the war, but were left in Sudan by the partition.

Shuqra was the last major Al-Qaeda stronghold in Abyan province to fall to government forces, which launched an all-out offensive last month that had already resulted in the recapture of the towns of Jaar and Zinjibar.
The militants remain in control of the smaller town of Al-Mahfad.
The defence ministry news website 26Sep.net confirmed the recapture of Shuqra, adding that units from several army brigades, as well as the elite Republican Guard and local anti-Qaeda militiamen, took part in the attack.

Mandiant said Unit 61398 was believed to have ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data"" from at least 141 organizations around the world. It traced the attacks to the doorstep of a non-descript building in Shanghai used by the unit.
China denied hacking and questioned the validity of Mandiant's report.
""Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable. Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.""
Mr Hong added that Beijing ""firmly opposes hacking"", has taken steps to prevent it and is also a victim of cyber attacks.
In its unusually detailed report, U.S.-based computer security company Mandiant said it had investigated hundreds of data breaches since 2004, most of which it attributed to what it termed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" actors.
The details it had uncovered, it said, ""convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them"".
The most prolific of these actors is APT1, which Mandiant says it ""a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006"".
""From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen,"" it said, adding that it was ""likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors"".
""We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support,"" said Mandiant.
The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to the site of 12-storey building in the Pudong area of Shanghai. It said that Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ""is also located in precisely the same area"" and that the actors had similar ""missions, capabilities and resources"".
Among the findings about APT1 in the report were that it: is staffed by hundreds, possibly thousands, of proficient English speakers with advanced computer security and networking skills; has hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries, 87% based in English-speaking countries, and is able to steal from dozens of networks simultaneously; has stolen hundreds of terabytes of information including blueprints, business plans, pricing documents, user credentials, emails and contact lists; stayed inside hacked networks for an average of 356 days, with the longest lasting 1,764 days; targeted industries identified by China as strategically important under its Five Year Plan for economic growth.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Daily Hürriyet’s Washington representative, Tolga Tanış, said that the Obama administration commenced its ‘disengagement’ from Syria on Oct. 2, laying out three conditions to the moderate rebels, should they wish for the resumption of aid.
A joint U.S.-Russia plan on the chemical disarmament of Syria and clashes between the Western-Arab-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) and al-Qaeda-linked rebels known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) factored into the halting of aid to the rebels. Turkey closed its Öncüpınar border gate on Sept 18 amid an al-Qaeda advance and the U.S. stopped a batch of non-lethal aid to moderate rebels, the English-language Hürriyet Daily News reported.
At the same time a group of Syria’s most powerful rebel brigades have rejected the Western-Arab-backed opposition group, Syrian National Coalition (SNC), which announced the creation of an interim government in exile. The 13 rebel groups, led by the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, called on supporters of the Syrian opposition to embrace Sharia law.
On Oct 2, the State Department officials conferred and decided on sending three messages to the moderate rebels. Citing an unnamed source who attended meetings, Tanış said the first one was that the U.S. would not repeat the same mistake in Afghanistan where supported groups were radicalized; instead, Washington would wait for moderate groups to distance themselves from radicals. The second one was that the U.S. would not resume its provision of aid until Turkey reopens its border gate and the moderate rebels took control of the northern Syrian town of Azaz. The third and final one was that the U.S. would not allow for any further developments until it heard ‘good news’ from the rebels.
The opposition tried to solve the deadlock and even pushed al-Nusra Front out of the Saudi Arabian-backed Islamic Army, but could not convince Washington to ‘disengage’ from Syria at the time.
A U.S. official advised Oct 21 that the aid to rebels had officially ceased. “ISIS has blocked the dispersal of part of the aid. The border gate is closed and we cannot distribute necessary supplies,” he said, according to the HDN.

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/237900/,Turkish writer exposes persecution of Jews in Turkey: publisher,4/19/17,Turkey,N/A,,"Publisher of The California Courier Harut Sassounian in his latest article blasted the Israeli government for not whispering a single word of criticism in the face of persecution of fellow Jews in Turkey.
The article reads:
Israel National News published an extremely interesting article written by Turkish journalist Uzay Bulut on the discrimination and persecution that Turkish Jews have suffered since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923.
This is an important exposé since the Turkish government has gone to great lengths for many decades to deceive the international community that there is great tolerance for Jews in Turkish and that Jews lived in a democratic society which protected their civil and religious rights. The aim of this Turkish propaganda campaign was two-fold: to keep Israeli leaders and American Jews happy so they would support Turkish interests in Washington and enlist the political lobbying clout of American Jews in Washington to counter congressional efforts to recognize the Armenian Genocide.
The Turkish government back in 1992 commemorated with a big splash the 500th anniversary of Jews fleeing from Spain and relocating in Turkey. Ankara co-opted many of the Jewish community leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, into propagating this false historical narrative. When I wrote an editorial back then exposing the lies of that celebration, I got a letter from the head of the commemorative events, asking why I wanted to cast a negative light on their celebration. Interestingly, that Jewish leader did not contest any of the facts in my article on the persecution of Jews in the Ottoman Empire throughout the centuries.
Bulut’s article is significant because it describes the persecution of Jews not centuries ago but during our own times in ‘modern’ Turkey! The article begins with a news item from the Turkish Milliyet newspaper reporting that dozens of historic Jewish synagogues “run the risk of disappearing forever.” One of the main reasons why these synagogues are disappearing is that the majority of the Jewish community of Turkey has departed from Turkey fleeing from “systematic discrimination and campaigns of forced Turkification and Islamization.” Bulut reports that in 1923, at the beginning of the Turkish Republic, there were 81,454 Jews in Turkey. That number has dwindled to “fewer than 15,000.” The last of Jewish schools was shut down by the Turkish government in 1937, according to Bulut.
Here is the list of the major episodes of Turkish persecution and discrimination against Jews and other non-Turkish minorities in recent decades, as compiled by Turkish journalist Bulut:
-- The Turkish Law of Family adopted in 1934 forced Jews and other non-Turks to abandon their ethnic names and adopt Turkish sounding names.
-- “Jews were deprived of their freedom of movement at least three times: in 1923, 1925 and 1927.” Bulut also mentions that “during the Holocaust, Turkey opened its doors to very few Jewish and political refugees and even took measures to prevent Jewish immigration in 1937.”
-- Hate speech and anti-Semitic comments are very prevalent in Turkish society and the media. Activities in support of Israel by the Jewish community were banned by the Republic of Turkey.
-- The Turkish government has assigned secret code numbers to individuals of Jewish, Armenian and Greek descent. That way the government can track them down and expose their background when necessary.
-- “Laws that excluded Jews and other non-Muslims from certain professions:” The Republic of Turkey banned these minorities from holding government positions. “Thousands of non-Muslims lost their jobs,” according to Bulut.
-- Prohibition of the use in public of all languages except Turkish. The “Citizen Speak Turkish” campaign in the first years of the Republic mainly targeted the Jewish community, according to Rifat Bali, the leading scholar of Turkish Jewry.
-- “The Jews of Eastern Thrace were targeted by pogroms from June 21-July 4, 1934. These began with a boycott of Jewish businesses, and were followed by physical attacks on Jewish-owned buildings, which were first looted, then set on fire. Jewish men were beaten, and some Jewish women reportedly raped. Terrorized by this turn of events, more than 15,000 Jews fled the region.”
-- The conscription of non-Muslims in the Turkish Army (1941-42). “On April 22, 1941, 12,000 non-Muslims (also known as “the twenty classes”), including Jewish men -- even the blind and physically disabled -- were conscripted. But instead of doing active service, they were sent to work in labor battalions under terrible conditions for the construction of roads and airports. Some of them lost their lives or caught diseases.”
-- “On Nov. 11, 1942, the Turkish government enacted the Wealth Tax Law, which divided the taxpayers in four groups, as per their religious backgrounds: Muslims, non-Muslims, converts (‘donme’), i.e. members of a Sabbatean sect of Jewish converts to Islam, and foreign nationals. Only 4.94 percent of Turkish Muslims had to pay the Wealth Tax. The Armenians were the most heavily taxed, followed by Jews. According to the scholar Başak İnce, ‘the underlying reason was the elimination of minorities from the economy, and the replacement of the non-Muslim bourgeoisie by its Turkish counterpart.’”
-- “During the 6-7 September 1955 government-instigated attacks against non-Muslim communities in Istanbul, Turkish mobs devastated the Greek, Armenian, and Jewish districts of the city, destroying and looting their places of worship, homes, businesses, cemeteries, and schools, among others.”
-- “Murders of Jews: Yasef Yahya, a 39-year-old Jewish dentist was brutally murdered on August 21, 2003 in his office in the Şişli district of Istanbul, many Jewish lawyers and doctors in Istanbul removed the signs on their offices in order not to have the same fate as Yahya.”
This list of continued harassment and persecution of Jews and other minorities should be sent to the international media each time that the Turkish government misrepresents its record of mistreatment of the Jewish community in Turkey.
It is a shame that the Israeli government does not whisper a single word of criticism in the face of such persecution of fellow Jews in Turkey. On the contrary, Israeli officials cowardly buckle under pressure from Turkey to deny the Armenian Genocide and ban this crime against humanity from Israeli TV and academic conferences.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

“The conflict won’t get settled through the use of force or threats,” he told a press conference in Yerevan, voicing intention to issue a similar statement in Baku, too.
The OSCE head stressed the need to take serious measures in the face of escalation of tensions at the line of contact.
“Hopefully, both parties will give new impetus to proposals to center on basic principles of the conflict settlement,” he said.
Mr. Gilmore noted that OSCE can solely assist the parties by offering a negotiation platform and fostering establishment of humanitarian contacts.
He further refrained from laying the blame for recent incidents on any of the sides, saying that it won’t contribute to peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Sources say that up to 25 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed in Azeri attacks in recent days in Tavush- Ghazakh zone of Armenian-Azerbaijani border.
On June 5 night, an attempt was made by Azerbaijani soldiers to infiltrate one of the positions of Artsakh defense army. Armenian side, however, managed to hinder Azeri attack, with NKR army units pushing Azeri forces back to the original positions.
Azerbaijani authorities try hard to concoct reasons behind the deaths and injuries on its side. In fact, these are saboteurs, killed or wounded by Armenian armed forces who were trying to hinder Azeri advancement. Thus, according to Azerbaijani authorities, Azeri soldiers commit mass suicides, get blown up by mine, and die in an accident.
On June 6, Azerbaijani media reported that a soldier, 19, was “blown up by mine.” He was hospitalized, with doctors assessing his state as moderate.
Sometimes, even a concrete slab kills an Azerbaijani soldier. For instance, it was reported that two Azeri servicemen were killed in Agstafa region, with another having been “injured during collapse of concrete slab.”

The Azerbaijani reconnaissance-subversive group crossed the NKR border in several hours after a meeting of the Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani Presidents, while Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was not happy with the meeting's results, Melik-Shahnazaryan told a PanARMENIAN.Net reporter.
""In his aspiration to occupy the NKR territory, the Azerbaijani President expected Russia's assistance. Since he has not achieved it, Aliyev left the Economic Forum in St. Petersburg, while it was the official reason for his visit to Russia. Thus, one can state that the night sally of Azerbaijani soldiers is a sort of bloody blackmail addressed to Russia and other states co-chairing the OSCE Minsk Group,"" stressed Melik-Shahnazaryan.
Besides, he noted that this is the first time since May 1994 that Baku does not reject the fact of an armed clash. ""Moreover, Azerbaijan has factually admitted the premeditation of the bloody action, attributing it to the ""right to restoration of territorial integrity"" of the Soviet Azerbaijan.""
According to the political analyst, the spokesman of the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry said that ""similar clashes indicate that Azerbaijan will never accept ""the occupation of its territories"", and ""such cases show that the Azerbaijani-Armenian, Karabakh conflict is not frozen.""
The Armenian expert believes that Azerbaijan is not ready for a dialogue based on the international right and is going to achieve NKR's occupation through blackmailing the world community, which is interested in preserving peace and stability in the South Caucasus.
""It means that the sally of Azerbaijani soldiers is a sort of message to the world geopolitical centers - if they don't solve the Karabakh problem in favor of Azerbaijan, it will launch a war, which will affect these centers' political and economic plans and opportunities. Thus, the incident suggests two ways.
First, the Armenian states should launch more active work to transfer the Karabakh conflict settlement from the political into legal field. Besides, Armenian diplomats should stir up their efforts in important international institutions. Second, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry's statement should be estimated correctly, it gives a green light to Armenian soldiers and we should use this opportunity.
From now on, soldiers of the NKR Defense Army have both moral and legal right to shoot at anything that is moving near the NKR state border. The only way to restrain Ilham Aliyev's ardor is to make him provide explanations on a daily basis to Azerbaijani parents with respect to reasons of their kids' death for the sake of political and territorial ambitions of the Azerbaijani President,"" concluded Levon Melik-Shahnazaryan.",yes,N/A,negative,D,1,

A Turkish court agreed on Friday to hear the controversial Ergenekon case, accepting the 2455-page indictment.



The first hearing of the case will be held on October 20 at a prison complex in Silivri town of Istanbul because of the large number of defendants.



The indictment said the investigation led the officials to a terrorist organization named Ergenekon, which has not been the subject of any criminal case previously and which has different objectives and activities when compared to other terrorist organizations.



""It has been determined that the nearest goal of the organization is to carry out activities that will cause governmental weakness in the country and to create a chaotic atmosphere that will spoil the public order, moreover, as a final goal, the organization aims to make people approve an unlawful attempt to be carried out against the government in such a chaotic atmosphere and to take over the government through an unlawful intervention,"" the indictment said.



Prosecutors accuse so-called Ergenekon gang of at least two violent acts initially blamed on Islamists - the 2006 bombing of a secularist newspaper and an armed attack on a top court the same year in which a senior judge was killed.



The group is also accused of planning to assassinate some prominent Turks in the past few years, including the Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, army chief Gen. Yasar 

Buyukanit, 2006 Nobel literature laureate Orhan Pamuk, pro-government journalist Fehmi Koru and some pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) officials.



The indictment added the gang is not linked to the Turkish armed forces and National Intelligence Agency (MIT).



The long waited indictment was submitted only two weeks ago, although the Ergenekon case started 13 months ago with the discovery of grenades in a house in Istanbul's Umraniye district.



The lack of the indictment in the operation, and the detainment of anti-AKP politicians, journalists and intellectuals without any legal charge raised eyebrows in Turkey, as many questioned whether the operation is being used to suppress opponents of the ruling party. 



Apart from the 86 already indicted, about 20 other people, including two retired four-star generals, a popular journalist and a prominent businessman, are awaiting charges, some of them in prison.



An additional indictment would be prepared for those detained in the sixth wave of the operation in July 1, including Kemalist Thought Association Chairman Retired Gen. Sener Eruygur, Retired Gen. Hursit Tolon and Ankara Chamber of Commerce (ATO).

The extent of the operation had widened since the closure case against the AKP filed in March.

The planned law, approved on July 1, sparked a backlash from Egyptian media after it included an article threatening at least two years in prison for publishing “false information on terrorist attacks that contradict official statements”.
On Wednesday, July 15, Egypt’s cabinet agreed to remove the threat of jail under article 33, but replaced it with a heavy fine, the Mena news agency said.
“The cabinet has agreed … to remove the prison sentence under article 33 and replace it by strengthening the fine, which can range from 200,000 to 500,000 Egyptian pounds ($25,000 to $64,000),” Mena said, quoting government spokesman Hossam al-Qawish.
But an official from the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate, Khaled al-Balchi, said the revision just created “another type of imprisonment” as the fine would still be far beyond the means of most journalists.
He also denounced the “totalitarian logic of the law, which aims to silence all opposition voices within the country”.
The justice minister, Ahmed al-Zind, has said the article was first adopted because of the media coverage of a wave of bloody jihadist attacks against the army in the Sinai Peninsula on July 1.
The military said 21 soldiers were killed in the violence, but media agencies reported higher tolls, citing unnamed security sources.
Rights group Amnesty International said the draft law “represents a flagrant attack on the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association” and “weakens safeguards to ensure fair trials and widens the use of the death penalty”.

On Thursday, November 23, militants loyal to the Islamic State took control of six new villages located in northeast Hama, namely: Rasm Ad Dahl, Abu Al-Khair, Buyad As Şaffaf, Rasm Al-Tawl Al-Sharkiyah and Tiwal Ad Dabaghin. These villages were formerly under HTS control but were abandoned without a fight by the latter.

At one point earlier this month, IS controlled just 3 villages in northeast Hama that were under attack by rival factions; however, HTS has found itself unable to maintain large numbers of fighters in all areas under its control, forcing it to concede some villages and rely heavily upon reinforcements from the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) and a handful of Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions.

Abundance of armament never brought anything good to Greater Caucasus.

Azerbaijan has now another cause of “pride”; it is recognized one of the world’s most militarized states. Azerbaijan is ranked 8th by the annual Global Militarization Index compiled by Bonn International Center for Conversion. A key indicator representing the level of militarization of a country is the comparison of military expenditures with its GDP. The U.S. which outstrips all other states by its total military spending is placed only the 30th. Another indicator which is taken into account in the Index is the number of the reserve.
December 22, 2012
PanARMENIAN.Net - No wonder Israel tops the list here: being in a totally hostile environment, the Israeli Defense Forces must be fully armed. The number of their reserve army ready to arrive at respective military units within an hour is simply amazing; Israel's reserve accounts to approximately 400 000.

Strange enough, Singapore comes second in the ranking. A city-state would hardly need so much armament; however, the proximity of China is perhaps troublesome for Singapore. Syria and Russia are placed third and fourth, respectively, which is quite natural and requires no explanations. Jordan, Cyprus and Kuwait come next, with Azerbaijan ranking 8th. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are the last ones in the top ten of most militarized states worldwide.

Now let’s get back to Azerbaijan. Its military spending in 2012 hit $ 3,2 bln, while the GDP made $67,5 bln. In 2011, Azerbaijan signed a major military agreement with Israel accounting for $1,6 bln. In addition, it imported arms from Russia and several other countries. The targets of this armament are obvious: not only Armenia, but Iran as well, in case the war is really unleashed. Apparently, hostilities against Nagorno Karabakh won’t require such amount of armament. Still, the forces that turn Azerbaijan into a powder-barrel go for much risk. The social tensions in the country along with anti-Armenian statements and increasing hysteria can finally blow up namely Azerbaijan. In some hands, the blast might hit Armenia and Karabakh. However, realization will soon follow the euphoria, and the same blow may turn against the Aliyev family as well.

Meanwhile, we’ve repeatedly mentioned that oil production is steadily declining in Azerbaijan. Richard Morningstar, the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan declared that Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oilfield reserves will be depleted, and the energy sector revenues have already fallen. In this regard, he stressed the need to diversify Azerbaijan’s economy saying the country should abandon its oil-dependency within the coming 10 years. If Aliyev’s clan maintains power for another 10 years, it risks facing financial and moral bankruptcy. Most likely, Baku is rushing to buy expensive toys, being perfectly aware that it soon will not be able to afford even an АК-47. This is an exaggeration, of course, but this is the current situation in Baku now, and it should hardly be proud of being the 8th among the most militarized countries of the world.

Synthesizing new in-depth research and archaeological discoveries of the last 50 years, the landmark exhibition Age of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 B.C.– A.D. 220) explores the unprecedented role of art in creating a new and lasting Chinese cultural identity. The works in the exhibition—extremely rare ceramics, metalwork, textiles, sculpture, painting, calligraphy, and architectural models—are drawn exclusively from 32 museums and archaeological institutions in the People’s Republic of China, and a majority of the works have never before been seen in the West. The exhibition also examines ancient China’s relationship with the outside world, Art Daily said.
Thomas P. Campbell, Director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, stated: “It is a great pleasure for us to present this magnificent assemblage of treasures from China. A project of such scale and scope could not be realized without the strong support and cooperation of lending organizations and their staffs. As the largest and most important display of Chinese art to be held in the United States in 2017, the exhibition establishes a new milestone in U.S.-China cultural exchange.”
“This exhibition is the culmination of our long history of collaboration with China that began in 1980,” said Maxwell, K.

Like the Roman Empire, the Han state brought together people of diverse backgrounds under a centralized government that fostered a new ‘Chinese’ identity. Even today, most Chinese refer to themselves as the ‘Han people’—the single largest ethnic group in the world. Thanks to new scholarship as well as the extraordinary artifacts unearthed by archaeologists in the past 50 years, this exhibition offers many new art-historical, cultural, and political insights.

Australia has deployed about 780 military personnel as part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in both Iraq and Syria.

The dossier, which was prepared on December 9 and presented by Armenia’s Ambassador to the UN, Karen Nazaryan, also includes a 90-page bilingual (English and French) booklet detailing the history and cultural significance of the Armenian monuments in Djulfa.
The current Nakhijevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan has been a historic part of the Armenian homeland for well over 2500 years. Its Armenian name translates into “the place of descent,” in reference to the landing of the Noah’s Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat. It has been an integral part of Armenian life from as early as 521 B.C. and as late as the first Armenian Republic from till 1920. The historic Armenian Cemetery in Djulfa, located at the southern tip of Nakhijevan near the Iranian border, traces its history from the 6th to the 17th centuries A.D., where more than ten thousand intricately carved cross stones (khachkars in Armenian) marked the final resting place of the Armenian inhabitants of this area for well over one thousand years and represented different eras of Armenian history and presence in the area.
Unfortunately, the Armenophobic policies of the successive Azeri governments resulted in the destruction of greater than 80 percent of these historic landmarks by 1998, having gone as far as removing their remnants from the area via trains. In 1998, the inhumane process of defacement and destruction of the remaining khachkars at the cemetery was accelerated by the Azeri government, resulting in further destruction of another 800 or so khachkars. This new assault was only halted through intervention of the UNESCO and ICOMOS; however, the process was resumed in 2002 and culminated in the final destruction of the remaining khachkars by the Azeri armed forces in December of 2005 and rolling of their remains into the Arax river.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Speaking to a group of foreign and local journalists, a Karabakh army Colonel urged them to maintain distance from each other, as unmanned drones were still flying nearby.
Only after the Nagorno Karabakh Defense Army destroyed the drone, the journalists were able to move forward to hotspots of military actions.

“Precision lies in the core of Armenian artillery. We are ready to fire every single moment.”

Also, the soldiers urged reporters to immediately return to safer areas, as the rival’s drones could target them any minute.

The comments are the first detailed public acknowledgement of a U.S. military presence in Somalia dating back since the U.S. administration of George W. Bush and add to other signs of a deepening U.S. commitment to Somalia's government, which the Obama administration recognized last year.
The deployments, consisting of up to 120 troops on the ground, go beyond the Pentagon's January announcement that it had sent a handful of advisors in October. That was seen at the time as the first assignment of U.S. troops to Somalia since 1993 when two U.S. helicopters were shot down and 18 American troops killed in the ""Black Hawk Down"" disaster.
The plans to further expand U.S. military assistance coincide with increasing efforts by the Somali government and African Union peacekeepers to counter a bloody seven-year insurgent campaign by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab to impose strict Islamic law inside Somalia.
Those U.S. plans include greater military engagement and new funds for training and assistance for the Somali National Army (SNA), after years of working with the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, which has about 22,000 troops in the country from Uganda, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Djibouti and Ethiopia.
""What you’ll see with this upcoming fiscal year is the beginning of engagement with the SNA proper,"" said a U.S. defense official, who declined to be identified. The next fiscal year starts in October.
An Obama administration official told Reuters there were currently up to 120 U.S. military personnel on the ground throughout Somalia and described them as trainers and advisors.
""They're not involved in combat,"" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that until last year, U.S. military advisors had been working with AMISOM troop contributors, as opposed to Somali forces.
President Barack Obama last year determined that Somalia could receive U.S. military assistance.
Another official said American forces over the years had provided advice and assistance in areas related to mission planning, small unit tactics, medical care, human rights and communications. The official said U.S. forces in Somalia have also facilitated coordination, planning and communication between AMISOM troop contributors and Somali security forces.

There is no way to confirm the famine but it is estimated that the death rate was 30/1000.,"A famine in a key North Korean grain-growing region in 2012 may have killed thousands of people at the same time as the country was staging mass celebrations to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the state's founder, according to a news agency based in Japan, Reuters said.

It was impossible to verify the report independently, and sporadic famines are commonplace in North Korea, according to experts based in South Korea. A United Nations analysis in 2011 showed that around a third of children were malnourished.

The report from Rimjin-gang/ASIAPRESS said that, based on its own reporting from the region and from contact with North Korean defectors and people crossing the border, a famine hit the North and South Hwanghae provinces in January-May 2012.

""Farming villages in the Hwanghae region, and especially in southern Hwanghae province, play an important part as a base for food supply for not just the army but also for city workers,"" the report, published last week, said.

It cited examples of farmers and laborers in the region, in the southwest of the country, saying that ""about a tenth"" of a work brigade of 60 people in one village had died. Another case cited said that the death rate had been ""30 people out of every 1,000. They say this is 30 times as high as a normal year.""

A report by the U.N. World Food Programme published in November estimated that overall food production rose by 10 percent for the 2012 and 2013 early season harvest, leaving a staple food deficit of 207,000 metric tons - something it said was ""the lowest in many years.""

Despite an improvement in the overall food picture in the North, the need to feed the army and ensure supplies to the capital Pyongyang, the showcase city and core support base for the government, meant it was possible there were regional famines that have not been reported, experts said.",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

The rebels seem to be backed by Russis.,"Ukraine's top priority is to build an army strong enough to stop Russian military aggression, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Friday, Nov 14, according to Reuters.

Ukraine has accused Russia of sending soldiers and weapons to help pro-Russian rebels in eastern regions launch a new offensive in a conflict that has killed more than 4,000 people.

""Building an army, which is capable of stopping aggression from Russia, is the number one task,"" Yatseniuk said in a televised briefing with journalists in which he gave his recommendations for top positions in a new coalition government.

Increasing violence, truce violations and reports of unmarked armed convoys reportedly traveling from the direction of the Russian border have aroused fears that a shaky Sept 5 truce could collapse.

A Ukrainian military spokesman said shelling had continued in the past 24 hours in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with one soldier and one five-year-old child being killed in different attacks.

The prospect of all-out war returning to eastern Ukraine has piled pressure on the country's struggling economy, sending the hryvnia currency plummeting and borrowing costs sky-high.

Yatseniuk said he did not expect the economy to grow before 2016 and suggested current Deputy Finance Minister Vitaly Lisovenko for the role of finance minister in a new coalition government.

The Prime Minister, who is all but certain to retain his post in the coalition, said his People's Front party would support President Petro Poroshenko's choice for defense minister and foreign minister.

Hundreds of Brotherhood supporters spent the night in Tahrir Square, having vowed to stay until the results of the election - which pits their candidate Mohamed Morsi against ousted president Hosni Mubarak's last Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq - are published.

Both Morsi and Shafiq have claimed victory in the election for a successor to Mubarak, sparking tensions between the rival camps that have deepened after the electoral commission delayed its announcement of the official outcome.

The delay in the announcement of the June 16-17 run-off, initially scheduled for Thursday, has raised suspicions that the outcome of the election is being negotiated not counted.

As the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and the Brotherhood clashed publicly over recent measures that consolidated the army's power, privately they have been engaged in talks, sources told AFP.

On Friday, the SCAF warned it would deal ""with utmost firmness and strength"" with any attempts to harm public interests, while the Brotherhood warned against tampering with the election results but said it had no intention of instigating violence.

The Brotherhood rejects a constitutional declaration by the military which strips away any gains made by the Islamist group since the uprising which overthrew Mubarak in February last year.

The document dissolves the Islamist-led parliament and gives the army a broad say in government policy and control over the new constitution. It was adopted just days after a justice ministry decree granted the army powers of arrest.

Even if Mursi wins, the changes leave the Brotherhood with no parliament, no say in the constitution and a powerless president.

In its scathing final report, the experts also dismissed the conclusions of the official inquiry. They said officials failed to pursue the investigative lines they suggested.
The case provoked outrage in Mexico, leading to street protests against perceived impunity.
""The delays in obtaining evidence that could be used to figure out possible lines of investigation translates into a decision to (allow) impunity,"" said the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) in its report.
The panel was commissioned by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
The trainee teachers went missing after taking part in a protest in the south-western city of Iguala, in Guerrero state, in September 2014.
Mexican prosecutors said they were detained by corrupt policemen under the orders of the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, and handed over to a local criminal gang (Guerreros Unidos), who killed the 43 men and burned their bodies in a local landfill site.
Relatives have always rejected this version, saying the government was trying to cover up the involvement of senior politicians and army officers in the killings.
The students had left the town of Ayotzinapa, where they studied, to take part in a protest in Iguala on 26 September 2014.
They were complaining against the employment policy of local authorities, whom they accused of discriminating against teachers of a rural background.
The students' protest reportedly disturbed a planned event organised by Maria de los Angeles Pineda, wife of the Iguala mayor Jose Luis Abarca, who had political ambitions.
The pair went on the run but were arrested weeks later in Mexico City.
Maria de los Angeles Pineda has been charged with involvement in organised crime.

In the Iranian Presidential Elections, the first stage of which is on June 12, main opponents are current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the latter supported by reformers and, what is quite important, by the youth up to 30 years old, who form 60% of the country's population. The elections in Iran are not so much important for the country itself. The vital point is whether the country will be able to join the world-wide system of values, which it has been refusing for 30 years already.
June 12, 2009
PanARMENIAN.Net - However, it's worth mentioning that these 30 years were not lost. After Ayatollah Khomeini came to power, Iran that was on the verge of collapse, developed into a strong and prosperous country, presently pretending to the position of the regional power. The nuclear ambitions of Iran played an important role in achieving this, although it is yet unknown whether they are real or it is simply a game with the muscles of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one of the participants in the assault on the American Embassy in 1979. They say Ahmadinejad lives in an old house of his, drives an ordinary car and is in no way like a president of a regional power. Nevertheless, he was able to win the previous elections and now has all the chances to duplicate the success, of course if he is really agreeable to the western partners. And here the complicacies begin. In the issue of Iran, the USA and Europe have opposite positions, to say nothing of Russia that has her own interests in the region and holds age-long ties with the Persian Empire. For Europe, Iran is important as the supplier of alternative energy and Teheran knows it well. For the USA, she is an ""Empire of Evil"" or something closest to it. But the Obama Administration is far from Rice and Cheney, who managed to convince the world that Iran must be punished for her nuclear program. There is one more important detail in the difference of approaches of Europe and the USA towards the future of Iran - the ocean. America is rather far and the problem of energy security of Europe doesn't worry her much. Or, better to say, it worries her but from purely imperial points of views. The same is true about Russia, but she is nearer and therefore - more dangerous.

""To me, this election is basically a referendum on President Ahmadinejad,"" says Nasser Hadian, Political science professor at Tehran University. In order to gain victory the current President used all the existing resources. The official media outlets, television and majority of newspapers are under his control. He travels through the Iranian province, where majority of his electorate lives. But his opponent is strong too. Fifty-four per cent of Iranians are ready to vote for former Prime Minister of Iran Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Let us note that he used to be the prime minister of the country for 8 hardest years - during the Iran-Iraq war. In 1988 Iran signed cease-fire, reached through the UN mediation. A year later Ayatollah Khamenei replaced late Ayatollah Khomeini in the position of the Spiritual Leader of Iran. The posts of the President and the Prime Minister were combined into one. President of the country became Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mousavi had to leave political life. After former President Khatami declared his unwillingness to participate in the coming elections, Mousavi announced his candidacy. And today he is the main rival for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Both Khatami and Mousavi are ethnic Azerbaijanis, but in a wider sense this makes no difference; any President of Iran will carry out the policy, which is advantageous to his country. The only matter is whether he will be able to carry it out and whether both internal and external forces will let him do it. Quite possibly Iran enters a new phase that was once interrupted after the withdrawal of Khatami, one of the first reformers. But, who knows, the positions of Ahmadinejad are rather strong too. On the other hand, Mousavi has promised to make the country more democratic. For instance he intends to repeal the order in which the standards of Moslem morals are controlled by the special police of dispositions; he is also ready to change the role of woman in the society. 

To make predictions in this case is rather difficult - parties interested in the victory of this or that candidate are too many. Stakes are high too - the Iranian gas, so necessary to Europe, especially when the realization of Nabucco is becoming ever more illusive. The outcome of elections in Iran barely plays any role for Armenia, but it is of great significance to Azerbaijan. Some politicians in Baku have already been hasty in stating that in case of Mousavi's victory the country's treatment towards Azerbaijan will be changed, for he is Azerbaijani. However, these hopes are too naive. Mohammad Khatami is Azerbaijani too; however, the policy of Tehran towards Baku hasn't changed at least for the last 30 years. Let us not make predictions, as not always they prove to be true for Iran. Naturally, the world is tired of the scandalous statements of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but is there any guarantee that the one replacing Mir-Hossein Mousavi will be more ""convenient""?",No,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

The President's budget recommends cutting U.S. economic aid to Armenia from the FY2006 actual level of $69 million to a proposed FY2008 level of $35 million.ANCA (Armenian National Committee of America) reports, that moreover, the budget proposal does not include any specific assistance figures for Nagorno Karabakh. The proposed military aid cuts come in two broad categories, Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET). The proposed FY2008 FMF figure for Armenia is $3 million, a cut of $960,000, fully 30% less than the proposed FY2008 figure for Azerbaijan of $4.3 million. The President is seeking only $300,000 in IMET for Armenia, down $538,000 from FY2006, a dramatic cut of 64%. In sharp contrast, the White House is proposing that Azerbaijan receive $1 million in IMET, a considerable increase over their FY2006 level of $823,000 and more than three times the IMET levels being proposed for Armenia.

Boxing Federation of Armenia boasts vast experience in organization of similar events, with Yerevan first hosting 2009 youth championships and international boxing tournaments since 2010.
This year Azerbaijan was among the countries expressing readiness to participate in the event, with Armenia, in turn, pledging to ensure Azeri athletes’ security. As a result, special Tbilisi-Baku charter flight operated for Azerbaijani boxers, who are currently staying at a separate hotel, with a group of security officers constantly guarding them.
Naturally, Azerbaijani sportsmen were not expected to receive standing ovation in Yerevan, with Armenian fans supporting their rivals.
It’s noteworthy that Armenian boxers were stoned and showered with profanities when performing at Baku-hosted 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships, which left them without support, forcing their friends out of the hall.
Instead, Azerbaijani boxers are free to watch Yerevan championships from separate stands, support their compatriots and take photos, with high-level security constantly ensured.
Even Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov confessed a few days ago that their athletes’ security was ensured at highest level.
However, inclusion of Artsakh Republic in the official pamphlet of the championships came as upsetting to Baku delegation.
In response, Vice-President of the Azerbaijan Boxing Federation Aghajan Abiyev stated, “We are looking forward for the Azerbaijani delegation to bring the pamphlet. We will further file the document to the International Boxing Association (AIBA). That’s a political issue. I believe the association is authorized to ban Armenian from hosting further international championships.”
With the pamphlet reflecting the mere reality, AIBA grants its permit, depending on the country’s ability to organize international championships. It’s noteworthy that Yerevan lent a helping hand to the association offering to host the event, after Thailand issued a refusal.
Yerevan championships are coming to an end, leaving only positive and unforgettable emotions. As for the Azerbaijanis… no doubt, they can’t confess even at heart to have liked the championships.

The favorite Azeri mottos 'Armenia is an aggressor' and 'Nagorno Karabakh is an integral part of Azerbaijan' are widely known to be unsubstantiated and meant only for brotherly Turkic people, the only ones to be supporting Baku at this point.
The ex-foreign minister of Turkey is no exception. In his address at a Baku-hosted forum South Caucasus in a Changing World, Hikmet Centin yet again spoke about occupation and refugees.
""A number of conflicts are ongoing in South Caucasus, negatively affecting regional stability and hampering cooperation between neighboring countries,"" Centin said, urging to resolve the Karabakh issue.
The ex-official went on to slam the OSCE Minsk Group's activity noting that the latter needs new ideas in promoting the conflict settlement. He further drew an intimidating picture of the Karabakh conflict ""posing threat to international security.""
""Finding solution to the protracted Karabakh issue is much harder than settling conflicts in Cyprus, Abkhazia, Ossetia,"" he said.

The main player in the region is the U.S., which is interested in stability in the Near East and Caucasus. This power's wish to push Russia from the South Caucasus, specifically from Armenia, is also an important factor. Professor of international relations and politics of the Universidad de San Andrés in Buenos Aires, Dr Khachik Ter-Ghukassian comments to PanARMENIAN.Net on the ongoing events in the region and their possible impact on Armenia.
The international community attaches big importance to the events taking place in the Neat East. How do you assess the current situation?

The Near East is of great interest for Washington. It specifically refers to the Caucasus. The U.S. is perfectly aware that war with Iran will redouble instability in the region while Washington needs ""an arc of stability"" from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. First of all, it concerns oil. The U.S. stands for cooperation but the situation is tensed, if not explosive. Although, Washington has intentions to improve relations with Iran. 

However, certain difficulties may cause internal developments in the Caucasus. It's quite possible that the map of the Near East may change. Anyway, there are some preconditions for it. The U.S. plans a ""mild"" division of Iraq with further formation of independent Kurdistan. At the same time I should stress that U.S. presence in Iraq doesn't alleviate tension. Unfortunately, the Arab world lacks either political or intellectual force capable to change the situation.

Normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations becomes more urgent for the United States. Can Washington have its will?

At the moment Turkey's foreign policy is targeted at Northern Iraq and improvement of relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan, what includes development of communications and military-strategic partnership. If Turkey's succeeds in realizing its plans Armenia will be isolated from the world. Curiously enough, such state of things is not convenient for the U.S. which insists on opening of the Armenian-Turkish border. However, normalization of relations without preconditions is a dangerous tendency. Turkey doesn't open the border proceeding from political reasons: the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the Armenian Genocide and absence of fixed border with Armenia. The only legal basis for demarcation of borders is the Sevr Treaty. No agreement signed after Sevr, namely the Kars and Moscow treaties, do not have juridical effect, since the signatory powers stopped their existence as elements of international law. The Sevr Treaty was signed August 10, 1920. Borders with independent Armenia had to be marked by a neutral mediator, namely the United States, according to it. 

At that we should not forget that Turkey has always been the biggest danger for the Armenian people. This opinion should be shared by the whole nation, both in Armenia and Diaspora. On the other hand, opening of borders can tell on Armenia's economy. Georgia, where the local industry was destroyed because of the abundant flow of cheap Turkish goods, can serve as an example. Certainly, Armenian economy can't compete with the Turkish, but we will have an outlet to the world, at least. Although, we are not ready to make a reality of the scenario we will be offered.

Iran and Armenia enjoy lasting and friendly ties. How would you comment on them?

If the United States collides with Turkey over Northern Iraq and simultaneously improves relations with Iran, it will be the best scenario for Armenia. Actually, under circumstances Russia's presence as a security guarantor for Armenia will lose urgency. We should strengthen relations with Iran. 

Iran is a minority in the Islamic world, since it practices Shi'ism. This state is the potential regional power. Will Washington have a political force to hold a dialogue with Iran as equals? This is the core of the problem. How the balance will be maintained between the Sunnis (al Qaeda) and Shiites? How the Lebanese problem will be resolved. These are questions that need exact answers. Under any circumstances, the Armenia-Iran relations should be apart any shocks in the region.

220 members of the House of Representatives have supported the Armenian Genocide Resolution. Do you think it will be put on vote?

The U.S. government will use the H.Res.106 as the main took of pressure on Turkey. Struggle between Democrats and Republicans as well as the presidential elections in the United States may speed up or, on the contrary, protract the decision. If Washington is really interested in normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations it will press on Turkey with this Resolution. As to the opinion, that passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution is necessary for the Armenian community of the U.S., I am convinced that opposing Armenia and Diaspora in the Genocide issue is dangerous and immoral.

Argentina is among the states that recognized the Armenian Genocide. How efficient are the activities of the Armenian community of Argentina?

Argentina is the second, after France, state where the Armenian Genocide is recognized on the legislative level. The history of the Genocide is a compulsory subject in schools of Buenos Aires. The Hay Dat Argentinean Office has organized a special textbook. It also holds seminars for school teachers.

I would like to note that Venezuela, which is far enough from the major states of South America, has also recognized the Armenian Genocide. In the 1980-ies Armenians of Argentina and other South American states started integration into in the society. We have become a part of the countries, which gave us shelter. We should proceed on this way basing on the example of the Armenian community of France.

""It's not too late for President Obama, who came into office promising to grow U.S.-Armenia economic relations, to negotiate a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, put in place a badly-needed new Tax Treaty, and organize targeted trade missions promoting cooperation in IT, health care, education, tourism and other key sectors of Armenia's economy.""

Officials want to protect employees from abuse and prevent ""karoshi,"" or death by overwork, RT reports.
The list includes major companies such as advertising agency Dentsu and electronics maker Panasonic, who are blamed for illegal overtime. A local unit of Japan Post, a subsidiary of Japan Post Holdings is accused of failing to report work-related injuries.
Companies that abuse workers have been called “black” by the local media. The problem intensified when a young worker at Dentsu committed suicide in 2015. The death was recognized as “karoshi,” encouraging Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to push for labor reforms.
The list, which now has 334 companies, will be updated monthly. The term “karoshi” was introduced in the 1970s and is still dominating the national headlines.
According to Reuters quoting Japanese officials, not all companies under investigation are included in the list. The names of companies are only disclosed when the ministry decides doing so would help encourage compliance and would be for the public good. In March, Abe’s government proposed steps capping overtime and introducing better pay for part-time workers.

In eight years of torrid growth, the company has often clashed with local public officials seeking to minimize the impact of short-term rentals on neighborhoods and urban housing markets. Now, those simmering tensions are starting to boil.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday, October 21 signed legislation that Airbnb says could seriously damage its business in New York City, the company's largest U.S. market; the company immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn the law. The German capital of Berlin recently passed a law banning most short-term rentals, and Barcelona and Amsterdam are imposing steep fines for listings that violate laws there.
Airbnb is also engaged in a pitched battle in its home of San Francisco, where the company has also sued to block a new requirement that it reject booking fees from property owners who have not registered with the city.
The New York and San Francisco legal fights are a crucial test of Airbnb’s business model. The company argues it cannot legally be held responsible for how landlords use its platform. If it is required to enforce local laws on short-term rentals, that could drastically reduce listings - and revenue - in some of its biggest markets.
Other cities looking to rein in Airbnb are watching the San Francisco proceedings and looking to the city's law as a potential model, said James Emery, deputy city attorney of San Francisco.
""Throughout the country, people representing cities have called me to ask what's going on with the litigation,"" he said.
Airbnb's legal argument in both the San Francisco and New York cases rely on a 20-year-old statute designed to protect free speech online, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In the San Francisco lawsuit, the company asserts that the city ""impermissibly treats Airbnb as the publisher or speaker of third-party content"" when it is merely a platform for communications between property owners and guests.
Other online marketplaces - such as Amazon (AMZN.O), eBay (EBAY.O), and Craigslist – have cited the same law to shield themselves from liability for any improper transactions among users of their services.

“After recently having a Dutch journalist arrested in her home after criticizing Erdogan on Twitter and demanding of Germany that a Turkish satirist be arrested and extradited (a demand that was granted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel) there is little doubt that the Turkish government is serious about playing offense against foreign media daring to stand up to the regime,” Rothstein said.
“This is happening on top of the ongoing and persistent violence toward and oppression of Kurds in Turkey, something that, much like the Armenian Genocide, is vehemently denied by Erdogan and his henchmen.”
Citing Erdogan’s recent remarks that the Armenian Genocide never happened and that “anyone who claims it did is an enemy of Turkey,” the author analyses the reasonability of Israel’s moves to mend ties with the Muslim nation.
“This development is worrisome for many reasons, and Israel should think twice before getting in bed with the likes of Erdogan,” Rothstein says.
Remembering the millions of Armenians, Greeks, Kurds and other minorities murdered by the Ottoman Empire in the Genocide of 1915, the author says that Israel has great friends in the Kurds, and standing with Erdogan and his AK Party means actively selling them out, and to a larger extent selling out the values that “Israel alone champions in the region by not using its voice to condemn the anti-democratic Islamist regime in Ankara that goes beyond laws, borders and decency to oppress its people.”

The government department that runs Parliament House announced earlier this month that ""persons with facial coverings"" would no longer be allowed in the open public galleries of the House of Representatives or the Senate. Instead, they were to be directed to galleries usually reserved for noisy schoolchildren, where they could sit behind sound-proof glass.
The announcement was made a few hours before the end of the final sitting day of Parliament's last two-week session and had no practical effect.
Hours before Parliament was to resume on Monday, the Department of Parliamentary Services, or DPS, said in a statement that people wearing face coverings would again be allowed in all public areas of Parliament House.
It said face coverings would have to be removed temporarily at the security check point at the front door so that staff could ""identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk.""
A DPS official, who declined to be named, citing department policy, said that by late Monday no visitor to Parliament House that day had a covered face. Face veils are rarely seen in the building.
The ban on face veils in the public galleries had been widely condemned as a segregation of Muslim women and a potential breach of federal anti-discrimination laws.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott later revealed that he had not been notified in advance that the ban was planned and had asked House Speaker Bronwyn Bishop to ""rethink that decision.""
The restriction had been authorized by Bishop, who has campaigned for a ban on Muslim head scarves in government schools, as well as Senate President Stephen Parry.
The controversy came as the government attempts to assure Australia's Muslim minority that tough new counterterrorism laws and police raids on terror suspects' homes in recent months were directed at countering criminal activity, not any particular religion.
The opposition welcomed the overturning of what it described as a ""burqa ban,"" and demanded an explanation for why it had been introduced in the first place.
""In 2014 for two weeks, the official policy of the Australian Parliament was to practice segregation and we need to ensure this does not happen again,"" senior opposition lawmaker Tony Burke said in a statement.
But Senator Jacqui Lambie, from the minor Palmer United Party, said the ban's reversal made Australia appear weak and indecisive on national security.
""The decision today to allow burqas and other forms of identity-concealing items of dress to be worn in Australia's Parliament will put a smile on the face of the overseas Islamic extremists and their supporters in Australia who view the burqa or niqab as flags for extremism,"" Lambie said in a statement, according to the AP.
Parry revealed Monday that the policy on face coverings was not made on the advice of police or the national domestic security agency.
He told a Senate committee that the ban had been warranted as an interim measure because of police advice that 10 men and women had plotted to ""disrupt"" the House of Representatives ""wearing garments that would prevent recognition of their facial features and possibly their genders.""
The plan was never carried through. But Bishop told Parliament that she and Parry would have been ""derelict in our duty"" if they had not dealt with ""an action planned that would have disrupted the business of the House.""
Parry also revealed that months before the threatened protest in the House of Representatives, he and Bishop had many discussions about the security implications of face coverings.

She was Spain’s richest woman and a major stakeholder in Inditex SA, the owner of the Zara chain that expanded rapidly across the globe over the past several decades, The Associated Press reports.
Inditex issued a statement Friday, Aug 16, confirming her death but did not provide more details and declined comment via email. Spanish media widely reported that Mera suffered a stroke while on vacation on the Mediterranean island of Menorca and died Thursday night at a hospital in La Coruna, the city where she was born in Spain’s Galicia region.
Mera founded the first Zara store in 1975 in La Coruna with her then-husband, Armancio Ortega. He is listed by Forbes as the world’s third richest person.
They were originally going to call the store Zorba after the “Zorba the Greek” movie, but there was a bar with that name a few blocks away from the site, so the letters on the Zorba sign were rearranged to spell out Zara.
The store specialized in low-priced versions of more expensive popular clothes, and the formula turned into a success for store openings across Spain and then internationally.
Mera held 5.1 percent of Inditex, and her fortune was estimated by Forbes at $6.1 billion. The magazine says she was the world’s 195th richest person but was in the No. 1 spot on its list for “wealthiest self-made woman.”
She also gained recognition by voicing opposition to changes in Spain’s abortion laws and to government cutbacks in name of austerity affecting Spain’s cherished education and national health care programs.

The decision to fund infrastructure for 1,600 units at Ramat Shlomo settlement, situated on land expropriated from Palestinians, was taken on Sunday, August 25 evening during a meeting of the Jerusalem municipality finance committee.
At the same meeting, the municipality decided to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and Israel’s tourism ministry in allocating a total of £3.6m to the City of David National Park, an archaeological site that dovish Israelis view as the spearhead of an effort to transform the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem into a Jewish area.
Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for the PLO, said that plans to expand Ramat Shlomo “are a continuation of Israel’s policy of carrying out a flagrant ethnic cleansing of East Jerusalem, are a total disregard of US Secretary of State John Kerry’s initiative and a direct blow to peace.” An official in Netanyahu’s office disputed this. He claimed that Ramat Shlomo would be under Israeli rule in any peace agreement.
“It is time we had a more sensible discussion about building in Jerusalem,” he said.
Yonatan Mizrachi, head of the Emek Shaveh organisation of dovish Israeli archaeologists, criticised the City of David move. “The funding means that the government views this as part of Israel…” he said. “There is a gap between what Israel is saying, that ‘we’re negotiating’, and what it is doing.

The headline new feature is the overdue implementation of bookmarks into the browser, BetaNews reports.
It’s also joined by the first Linux beta build since Opera relaunched last year, plus offers a redesigned Start page, integrated PDF viewer and support for web notifications direct from the Windows or Mac desktop.
By far the most significant feature has to be added support for bookmarks, which has been the number one feature request from users since the new Chromium-based version of Opera debuted back in July 2013.
Users can now add bookmarks via the heart button to the right of the main Address bar -- once clicked, users get a choice of images, plus the opportunity to file the bookmark directly into a folder (new or existing). Sadly, Opera has still to implement an import option for quickly transferring bookmarks from other platforms, BetaNews says.
Existing bookmarks can be accessed from the Bookmark Manager, accessible via the Opera menu or by pressing [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [B]. Users browse by folder using the left-hand pane, with that folder’s bookmarks displayed on the right, either as a simple list or as a grid with the associated image used to maximum effect.
Other changes in version 25 are note-worthy by themselves too. The Start page has been redesigned to use tiles instead of screenshots, inspired by Coast, Opera’s iPad and iPhone browser.
Version 25 also debuts a built-in PDF viewer that Opera promises is lightweight and fast, saving users the hassle of switching applications. Another change sees web notifications delivered as normal Windows or Mac notifications.
Version 25 also introduces support for H.264 video and MP3 audio, and sees the long-awaited Linux build move one step closer to final release as it finally joins its Mac and Windows brethren in the beta channel.

In recent years, Switzerland has been actively filled by very wealthy citizens, originally from Kazakhstan. Many of them have chosen this country as a place for their permanent location, not only for the love of the nature beauty, but because of the neutrality of the state. Most of them choose Switzerland as a second home in a means of escape from prosecution in his homeland.
April 12, 2013
PanARMENIAN.Net - One of the most prominent citizens of Kazakhstan, who found refuge on the shores of Lake Geneva - Victor Khrapunov and his family. Until the recent past (before 2008) Khrapunov was mayor of the largest city of Kazakhstan - Almaty, for 7 years, after that he was appointed as a governor of a region of the country, sat in a chair the Minister of Emergency Situations. He left Kazakhstan in spring, 2008.

But it is worth noting that he chose Switzerland not only by chance - he was associated with it for many years. His wife, Leila, a successful business-woman in the distant 90's (when her husband, by the way, sat in the chairs of the Deputy Mayor of Almaty, the Minister of Energy and Electrification of Kazakhstan and Minister of Energy and Natural Resources) had established trade relations with Switzerland. She engaged in importing Swiss goods of the highest quality to Kazakhstan. The children of Victor Khrapunov, Ilyas and Elvira, studied at Geneva. Here, both of them started a successful career. Ilyas Khrapunov today heads the company «Swiss Development Group», which, allegedly, was founded in 2007. The company is engaged in major construction.

Today, in Switzerland Khrapunov is known as very rich people. According to the Swiss magazine «Bilan», Viktor Khrapunov in 2009 was part of a list of three hundred richest people of Switzerland.

But according to the criminal case materials, very meticulously described in the Kazakh media, the main capital was accumulated by Khrapunov while he was a mayor of Almaty city. At home he is accused of receiving large bribes, money laundering, fraud, organizing crime and abuse of power. Well, in general, the entire list, which is traditionally presented to almost all former officials.

The main fault of Khrapunov, which is known for everyone in Kazakhstan- sale of land in unique foothills of the Zailiyskiy Alatau (near Almaty). This area is called the second Switzerland: magnificent mountains, perennial Tien Shan spruce, excellent slopes for downhill skiing. Near Almaty, incidentally, there is the highest ice skating rink in the world - Medeo, a unique ski resort Shymbulak. Victor Khrapunov easily sold the land situated around the coast of almost all small rivers in and around the city deriving them from the register under the ""economic needs"". And the majority of these lands fall under the prohibited category, as they were in the water protection area.

Even after the departure to Switzerland and the appearance of a criminal case in the homeland, Khrapunov began actively claiming that he was ""the initiator of important reforms, he has devoted his career to the development of Kazakhstan"" (from the materials of his site.) And all the illegal construction in protected areas - order from above. ""

However, in one interview Khrapunov blurted out that he signed up all the documents so that no one quarreled. At the same time he purchased a house for himself: ""The Director of ski resort told me that I could make out the purchase of the house ... I signed a contract, the house was completely constructed, and on building construction there were issued all the documents in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan. So I became the legal owner of the house in the area of the ski resort Shymbulak, which was later sold. ""(Over 5 million - auth.) By the way, this house was built in the same restricted area, building permit was signed personally by Khrapunov).

Jack Reed said",4/30/07,USA,N/A,,"Senators and Representatives joined Armenians around the world this week in commemorating the 92nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in statements on the floors of their respective chambers of Congress, reported the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) 



A major theme in their remarks was the importance of helping to end U.S. complicity in Turkey's continued campaign of Genocide denial by passing the Armenian Genocide Resolution (S.Res.106 and H.Res.106). Several called specifically for decisive U.S. and international action to end the genocide currently taking place in Darfur, noting that Turkey's ability to commit genocide with impunity has set a dangerous precedent that has encouraged other genocides.



Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said, ""In order for democracy and human rights to flourish, we must not support efforts to rewrite and deny history. In the United States, we strive to make human rights a fundamental component of our democracy. It is long overdue for our nation to demand that the truth be told. We must recognize the Armenian genocide in the name of democracy, fairness and human rights ... It is important that we recognize the Armenian genocide while its survivors are still with us to tell their stories. We must recognize the genocide for the survivors. We must recognize the genocide because it is the right thing to do. We must recognize the Armenian genocide to help shed light on the darkness and move toward a more humane world.""



Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said, ""California is home to many of the descendants of the genocide's survivors, who immigrated to the United States and, over the course of a few decades, built strong and vibrant communities. Working closely with the Armenian - American community over my many years in public service, I know how alive and painful this issue continues to be for many Armenian Americans... Let there be no mistake. The ongoing genocide in Darfur, carried out by the Government of Sudan and its Janjaweed militias, traces its roots to the silence and quiescence of the international community during previous episodes of genocide and ethnic cleansing, including the Armenian genocide.""



Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) said, ""Today, as a proud supporter of S. Res 106, legislation officially recognizing the Armenian genocide, I urge the President to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the U.S. record relating to the Armenian genocide. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated over 50 years after the Armenian genocide that: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere... Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.' The time has come to officially recognize the Armenian genocide... Menk panav chenk mornar. We will never forget."" 



Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) said, ""Mr. Speaker, if America is going to live up to the standards we set for ourselves, and continue to lead the world in affirming human rights everywhere, we need to finally stand up and recognize the tragic events that began in 1915 for what they were: the systematic elimination of a people... And the fact of the matter is that when some of my colleagues say to me, 'Well, why do you need to bring up something that occurred 92 years ago,' I say, 'Because by denying this, the Turkish Government continues to perpetrate genocide or oppression of its minorities.'""



Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said, ""Opponents take issue with the timing of the [Genocide] resolution and argue that Turkey is making progress with recognizing the dark chapters of its history. This claim lost all credibility when Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's Nobel Prize winning author was brought up on charges for 'insulting Turkishness' for alluding to the genocide, and Turkish Armenian publisher Hrant Dink was gunned down outside his office in Istanbul earlier this year. Yet some opponents go even further, such as a former Ambassador to Turkey who argued that the time may never be right for America to comment ""on another's history or morality. ''Such a ludicrous policy would condemn Congress to silence on a host of human rights abuses around the world. After more than ninety years and with only a few survivors left, if the time is not right now to recognize the Armenian Genocide, when will it be?""



Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) said, ""I have always supported the Armenian community. In 2003, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to plant a tree at the Genocide memorial. We must never forget the horrors that took place 92 years ago. Let us never forget the 1.5 million Armenians who perished in 1915 and 1916. We know such mass murder is not a tragedy from a distant past, but a continuation of the failing to recognize these barbaric acts before they are executed.""



Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-MA) said, ""The writer Milan Kundera once wrote that 'The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.' There are those that would deny the Armenian Genocide... In commemorating the Armenian Genocide we collectively engage in that struggle of memory against forgetting... to reaffirm our commitment to prevent such things from ever happening again, and to strive towards making a better future for the Armenian people.""",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Most probably it will be realized by the very Afghan mojakheds with their leader Shamil Basaev who disgracefully escaped the Armenian Army. As for ""the native Azeri city"", our neighbors should finally read the historical chronicles.
May 8, 2008
PanARMENIAN.Net - They insist that the ancient Armenian fortress Shushi was given to the murderer of the peaceful Armenian population Persian khan Panakh, in 1752 by the help of the traitor Varanda Shakhnazar. Melik Shahnazar was later executed for the betrayal; however the fortress remained with the Persians. Having won the status of a city in 1857, Shushi increasingly developed and by 60's of XIX century became one of the spiritual centers of the Caucasus. Later on socio-political thought and scientific-cultural elite of the Armenians in the Caucasus developed here. The increasing number of the population of the city is a proof of the tangible growth of the socio-economic and cultural aspect of life. In 1850 12724 people lived in Shushi, in the 90's of the XIX century already 34.000 people dwelled in the city, in 1916 the number of the inhabitants of Shushi became 43.000, and in 1920 there were 60.000 people residing in the city of Shushi. The absolute majority of the population; i.e. 47.000, were Armenians (the numbers are taken from the respective numbers given by the ""Caucasian Calendar""). 

Till 1920 150 books were published in Shushi. Since 70's of the XIX century till 1921 22 magazines and journals were published in Shushi, 2 of which were in the Russian Language, and the other 22 were in Armenian. In the second half of the XIX century in the city of Shushi a number of Islamic religious and other buildings were built. Among these buildings are particularly the Upper and Lower Mosques which have survived up to present day. The Mosques stand for the memory of the Persian architecture, yet the present Azeri authorities say that they belong to them, exactly like the entire inheritance of the Persian Empire, which has remained after its breakdown. 

In March of 1920 the Turkish-Azeri troops burnt and robbed the Armenian part of Shushi, which occupied more than the half of the territory of the city. In three days the number of the population of the city decreased. 30.000 out of 47.000 Armenian population of Shushi became the victims of the formed gangs. 

Then it was the year of 1988. The war unleashed by Azerbaijan against the people of Artsakh turned the ancient Armenian city to a convenient strategic position for opening fires on Stepanakert. More than 15.000 shells were released towards Stepanakert. In the result of the bombarding thousands people of Stepanakert died and were injured, industrial enterprises and administrative offices, the infrastructure of the city were destroyed and 19 thousand people (27%) were left without shelter. Out of the created situation on May 8 the troops of Karabakh initiated an offense of the fire positions and military bases, situated in Shushi and in its outskirts. By the morning of May 9 of 1992 the city of Shushi was liberated by the help of the NKR self-defense troops. ",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Dubbed ThinkVision LT1423p, the display boasts a 13.3-inch viewable image and weighs slightly less than 1.6 pounds. This makes it an easy device to carry on the road for someone who prefers working from an external monitor, rather than a standard notebook screen.
The exact ship date for the display is unknown with Lenovo saying sometime in Q2. The display will be available in both a wireless and wired version. The wireless version promises 10 hours of battery life per charge, while the wired version connects to the host computer via a USB cable for power.
Both versions of the portable display feature the same 1600 x 900 resolution, with full support for pen-based input, which also covers handwriting with 256-degrees of pressure sensitivity. The wired version is tipped to cost $349 while the wireless is priced at $449.
Lenovo also showcased its new ThinkPad Helix at CES 2013. This Ultrabook is powered by an Intel Core vPro processor and features a full HD 11.6-inch display. The machine offers multiple storage and memory capacity options, along with five button click pad and optional 4G broadband. Plus, the 11.6-inch screen can be flipped around, turning the device into something akin to a tablet.

Three years after its uprising against autocrat Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia is in the final stages of establishing a full democracy before new elections that would be a rare bright spot in an unstable region.
Tunisia's new premier, technocrat Mehdi Jomaa, must tackle subsidy cuts sought by international lenders to curb the small North African country's deficit and also confront a growing threat from Islamist militants.
Illustrating the continued fragility, troops in the southern city of Tatouine fired into the air and police used tear gas on Thursday to disperse protests over economic hardship.
To end months of political crisis, Larayedh's moderate Islamist party Ennahda agreed late last year to a deal to hand over to an independent cabinet led by Jomaa, who will govern until the election.
""I have just handed my resignation to the president,"" Larayedh told reporters. ""The president will appoint the new prime minister, Mehdi Jomaa, shortly and he will present his new cabinet in the next few days.""
One of the most secular countries in the Arab world, Tunisia has struggled with divisions over the role of Islam and the rise of Islamist radicals since the uprising in 2011 that inspired other revolts in the region.

However, the bank said recent reforms unveiled by China were likely to help it achieve ""more sustainable and inclusive"" growth in the long term.
The Chinese government set out an ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda in November last year, aimed at overhauling its economy over the next decade.
These include reforming the financial and services sectors as well as the big state-owned enterprises.
""If implemented, the reforms will have a profound impact on China's land, labour, and capital markets, and enhance the long-term sustainability of its economic growth,"" the bank said in its latest report.
""Some reforms, including efforts to reduce regulatory and administrative burdens, reform taxation, and make more land available for commercial activities, are also likely to support growth in the short term.""
The bank also cut its growth outlook for Thailand. It predicts that the Thai economy will expand by 3% this year, down from its earlier projection of 4.5% growth.
It said that ""implementation delays and political uncertainties have been the major contributor"" to the slowdown.
A series of anti-government protests in recent months have stoked fears of political uncertainty in the country and its impact on the Thai economy.
The World Bank added: ""The expiry of the car tax rebate scheme, rising levels of household debt, falling commodity incomes, arrears in government subsidy payments to rice farmers, and crumbling consumer sentiment in the face of political instability all crimped consumption"".

The orders come as Trump prepares for his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Florida, where trade issues promise to be a major source of tension. China was the biggest contributor to the $734 billion U.S. goods trade deficit last year, and the meeting ""will be a very difficult one,"" Trump said in a tweet.
The directives allow Trump to focus on meeting his campaign promises to combat the flow of unfairly traded imports into the United States just a week after his pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare imploded in Congress.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters that one of the orders directs his department and the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct a major review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits.

But he said in some cases, currencies can become misaligned from their traditional valuations unintentionally, citing the Mexican peso's sharp decline late last year after Trump's election.

In 2011, Toyota lost the top spot to General Motors of the U.S. with Germany's Volkswagen coming second, after Japan's tsunami and earthquake, as well as flooding in Thailand, hit production.

The draft rule is the last major piece of banking reform put forward by world leaders since the 2007-09 financial crisis forced taxpayers to shore up undercapitalized lenders.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), made up of regulators from the Group of 20 economies (G20), said global banks like Goldman Sachs and HSBC should have a buffer of bonds or equity equivalent to 16 to 20 percent of their risk-weighted assets from January 2019.
The bonds would be converted to equity to ""bail in"" a stricken bank. The total buffer would include the minimum mandatory core capital requirements banks must already hold.
The proposal is set to be endorsed by G2O leaders later this week in Australia. It is being put out to public consultation until Feb 2, 2015.
FSB Chairman and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the buffer would be finalised next year, marking a watershed in ending banks that are too big to be allowed to fail.
The new rule will apply to 30 banks the FSB has deemed to be globally systemically important, though initially those from emerging markets would be exempt.
""Once implemented, these agreements will play important roles in enabling globally systemic banks to be resolved (wound down) without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system,"" Carney said in a statement.
Most of the banks would need to expand their issuance of debt to comply, the FSB said. Some senior debt already issued would will also need restructuring.
To avoid banks downplaying the riskiness of their assets to meet the new rule, the buffer, formally known as total loss absorbing capacity or TLAC, must also be at least twice their leverage ratio, a separate measure of capital to total assets regardless of the level of risk.
Globally, this yardstick has been set provisionally at 3 percent but it could be higher when finalised in 2015.
Parts of the buffer would be held at major overseas subsidiaries to reassure regulators outside a bank's home country.
""We believe TLAC will be a more material challenge in Europe than in the U.S.,"" Fitch ratings agency said ahead of the announcement. Extra requirements from national supervisors could swell the buffer to 25 percent of risk weighted assets, it added.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

In addition to Maren Ade, Anne Zohra Berrached was nominated for her drama 24 Weeks, which looks at the struggle of a young couple contemplating aborting their unborn child, and actress-turned-director Nicolette Krebitz picked up a Lola best director nomination for Wild, a drama about a young woman and her wolf that wowed the critics at its premiere in Sundance last year. Chris Kraus was the only male director to pick up a best directing nomination, for his latest, The Flowers of Yesterday.
Wild, 24 Weeks and The Flowers of Yesterday were also nominated in the best film category, alongside Toni Erdmann, Fatih Akin's coming-of-age drama Tschick and Welcome to the Hartmanns, a refugee-comedy from director Simon Verhoeven.

“We are in a period of changing consumer behavior,” Richard said this week during an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. There are fewer shoppers in search of the latest and greatest gadget, and more of them are seeking lower prices on wireless service, he said.
The shift has been especially severe in Europe, where more customers are keeping the same phone when they switch carriers. Amid a slumping economy and mounting competition, France Telecom has seen prices drop 25 percent over the past three years, squeezing profit margins and its stock price. Its cheapest plan now provides unlimited calls and texting and 3 gigabytes of data for about 20 euros ($26) a month -- about half the price of T- Mobile USA Inc.’s $50 plan, which is touted as a U.S. bargain.
The persistent belt-tightening in France and elsewhere in Europe has decreased the number of consumers who buy the latest phones at top prices, Richard said. Without a carrier subsidy, the iPhone typically sells for about $600, making it too pricey for many shoppers, he said.
The change may be felt when Apple introduces its latest iPhone this year, Richard said. The product’s annual refresh has traditionally drawn long lines and a frenzy of anticipation since it first debuted in 2007.

But they will change nothing, despite the hopes of some experts that are very far from the real levers of power capable to facilitate progress in resolving the Karabakh conflict.

The year of 2012, as expected, marked the continuation of processes that had begun in 2011 and seem almost endless. The “Arab Spring” that excited the whole world is gaining momentum, now under the green banner of the Prophet: victory of Islamists in Tunisia and Egypt, intervention of terrorist groups in the Libyan civil strife cannot but worry the international community.
January 9, 2012
PanARMENIAN.Net - Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the definition “Arab spring” is not so correct. According to political analyst Sergei Markedonov, the wave of mass protests began not in spring, but in winter, and it was in Tunisia in December 2010, after the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in protest against corruption and tyranny. “Not all the protesters identified themselves as Arabs. In view of consequences, the Middle East events of 2011 go far beyond a given region. The U.S., EU, Russia, and international organizations (the League of Arab States, UN, NATO) were all involved in the resolution of acute problems of the Middle East. For all the formal resemblance, the story of “awakening” in every single Middle Eastern country is unique in itself because of its singular ethnic and religious composition, foreign policy, social and economic development,” Markedonov said. So, the world will long continue to disentangle the Middle East “story”.

Among recent developments was Egypt’s prosecutor’s demand of death penalty for ex-President Hosni Mubarak. However, this demand was opposed by France, Russia and the United States. If after all Mubarak is sentenced to death by hanging, this act will add nothing to the “Muslim Brotherhood”, except for condemnation and possible obstruction by the world community. Let us not forget that Egypt was literally sitting on the “American needle” of subsidy and support. If the U.S. should be replaced by “Al Qaeda”, the case could end up with a second Iraq or Afghanistan.

The new year also marked the change of PACE president. On January 23 there expires the term of office of PACE President Movlud Cavusoglu. The two years spent by the Turkish deputy from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are unlikely to have added respect and prestige to the PACE, taking into account the Chairman’s fringe intervention in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. In an interview to the radio station “Voice of Turkey” Cavusoglu said that during his presidency in the PACE “The organization launched a struggle against dramatically increasing tendencies of racism and xenophobia in Europe as a threat which cannot be underestimated.” It is not difficult to guess what the Turkish deputy meant under racism and xenophobia in Europe. It is the anti-Islamic and anti-Turkish sentiments in some European countries, where the dominance of Muslims looms large. For 2 years Cavusoglu unsuccessfully tried to push forward the idea of ​​resuming the work of PACE Subcommittee on Nagorno-Karabakh. His successor, vice-president of the European People’s Party, Frenchman Jean-Claude Mignon is unlikely to insist on resolving the Karabakh conflict within the framework of PACE, as it’s not a prerogative of the organization.

The French Senate is to consider the bill criminalizing denial of Armenian Genocide passed by the lower house of Parliament. If the Senate approves (and in all likelihood so will it be), there will remain only one little thing - the signature of President Sarkozy. Here, perhaps, it’s worth noting that the votes of Armenian community cannot significantly affect the outcome of presidential election - after all, it is about 200 thousand votes against tens of millions. That is, it’s not just about the pre-election campaign, but also about Turkey, which Nicolas Sarkozy is going to once again cut down to size.

This year presidential elections will be held in co-chair countries of OSCE Minsk Group. But they will change nothing, despite the hopes of some experts that are very far from the real levers of power capable to facilitate progress in resolving the Karabakh conflict. As we have already mentioned, foreign policy of world powers proceeds not from the president’s personality, but solely from the interests of the state. In this regard quite indicative were the Turkish parliamentary elections of 2011, when only a few expected normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations. This story ended up with the Zurich protocols being returned to Turkish Parliament with little hope for ratification.

This year there may be held another meeting between the religious leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan - Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin II and Head of the Muslim Spiritual Administration Sheikh-ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade on a “neutral” territory, i.e. on the Azerbaijani - Nagorno-Karabakh border. Hardly is it possible that this meeting be an impetus for the resolution of the Karabakh conflict.

Over the past year, Qatar gave the government of Egypt's former President Mohammed Morsi some $8 billion in aid as it suffered through an economic slowdown. But since a popularly backed July 3 military coup in Egypt, relations have soured with the tiny Gulf nation, a main backer of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group in the region.
On Thursday, Hesham Ramez, the head of Egypt's Central Bank, said $2 billion in aid money was returned to Qatar after its government asked Egyptian officials to postpone the conversion of the funds to bonds as earlier agreed. Ramez spoke to the Youm 7 news website. An official at Ramez's office later confirmed the comments.
Meanwhile, Egypt's civil aviation ministry turned down a request by its Qatari counterpart to increase the number of flights between Egypt and Qatar from 28 to 42 weekly flights via its national career, Qatar Airways. The decision comes even after a sharp drop in passengers coming into Egypt following the unrest that followed Morsi's overthrow. Tourism, which accounts for nearly 20 percent of Egypt's foreign currency revenues, also tumbled.
As far as aid, Qatar has been sidelined in Egypt by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Those nations, which view the Brotherhood as a threat to Gulf monarchies, have promised $12 billion in aid for Egypt. The aid, in a mix of grants, cash deposits and oil and gas products, have been used to avert gas and electricity shortages and shore up Egypt's foreign reserves.
Egypt's central bank recently reported that the country's foreign reserves had reached $18.8 billion, their highest level in almost two years. Still, the country's military-backed interim government faces increasing unemployment, widespread poverty and a burdensome and ill-distributed subsidy system.
The pressure Egypt's government has placed on Qatar isn't just economic, however. Authorities also have targeted the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera satellite news network and its affiliates in Egypt by storming offices, detaining staffers, deporting correspondents and giving orders to take it off air. The government repeatedly cites what it sees as coverage biased toward the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi's supporters as a reason for its actions.

But choosing to organize a tribute to Russia – whose landmass spans from Europe to the Far East, and which launched the world’s first film school, VGIK, and has spawned key filmmakers, including Eisenstein, Tarkovsky, Sokourov and Zviaguinstev – is perhaps the festival’s most ambitious challenge to date, Variety said.
Two Russian films have won Marrakech’s top prize, the Golden Star: Mikhail Kalatozishvili’s “Wild Field” in 2008, and Ivan Tverdovsky’s “Corrections Class” in 2014. Tverdovsky’s coming-of-age drama “Zoology”, that won a Special Jury Prize at Karlovy Vary, is screening in Marrakech competition this year. It has been one of the most talked about pics at the fest.
An extensive delegation travelled to the red city, headed by Karen Shakhnazarov, CEO of Mosfilm Studio. It also included Pavel Lungin, who gave a masterclass at the fest, and other directors such as Anna Melikian, Alexei Mizguirev, Kirill Serebrennikov, Valeri Todorovski and Tverdovsky himself.
Thirty Russian films screened at the fest, including world classics such as Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin,” “Ivan the Terrible”, and Tarkovsky’s “Andrei Rublev” and key recent films, among them Chakhnazarov’s “Zero City,” Lungin’s “Taxi Blues” and “The Island,” Melikian’s “About Love” and Serebrennikov’s “The Student.”
The country tribute ceremony opened with a speech by French actress-director Fanny Ardant, who has recently completed a biopic about Stalin, played by French actor and Russian citizen, Gerard Depardieu, based on Jean-Daniel Baltassat’s 2013 novel “Le Divan de Staline,” which is due to be released in early 2017.
Ardant referred to key historical achievements of Soviet and Russian cinema, including Mikhail Kalatozov’s “The Cranes Are Flying” which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1958, and Andrei Konchalovsky’s Holocaust drama “Paradise,” which won a best director Silver Lion this year at Venice.
“The tribute to Russian cinema is one of the most distinctive to date,” said Ardant. “Each person has come with their own personality and singularity, their own universe and vision of humanity and the world, their own obsessions and questions. This is a chance to see all of Russia. Each voice is different, like trees in a forest.”
Her speech was followed by a spectacle choreographed by Nadedjad Lougine which combined two traditional dancers – one from Russia, the other from Morocco, against a background of two dancing silk fabrics, propelled by 12 giant fans, orchestrated by Daniel Wurtzel.
Clips from the films in the Russian retrospective were screened, followed by the extensive delegation taking the stage. The session concluded with screening of Mizguirev’s epic “The Duellist,” playing out-of-competition.
Talking to Variety prior to the tribute ceremony, Shakhnazarov emphasised that Russian cinema is very different from Soviet cinema and is a very young cinema, although it includes some veterans such as himself, who began their careers during the Soviet Union.
“This tribute is a very important event for us,” he explained. “The chance to show our films here and the possibility for people to understand us a bit more – both in terms of Soviet and Russian cinema – is a great opportunity, not just in the Arab world, but in terms of the exposure it brings in Europe and America,” Shaknazarov said.
Structures built up during Soviet cinema were completely destroyed in the early 1990s, making it necessary to build a new industry.
“In some senses, we have been very successful because we did build a new industry. Technology is much more powerful than in the Soviet era, we can now make much more with technology. But that by itself is insufficient to make great cinema. It’s much easier to build technology. It’s not so easy to build art. You need time, above all because we’re in the process of forging a new identity, which were trying to find after the collapse of Communism.”
Shakhnazarov suggested that there are few points of contact between the two cinemas, but considers that this is perfectly normal. “Cinema reflects life. that is why modernRussian cinema is very different from Soviet cinema, because life in Russia is so different now.”
In relation to Mosfilm, that was founded in 1920, three years after the Russian Revolution, Shakhnazarov explained that it was completely rebuilt after the collapse of the Soviet Union and has been given a contemporary market-driven philosophy and equipped with state-of-the-art technologies.
“In different ways, we work with 80% of Russian film and TV production. Now we work with TV more than cinema. We are state-owned but we have a completely free market approach. We make our films without any subsidy support.”
As a director Shakhnazarov continues to be very active. One of his latest productions is the $10 million project “Anna Karenina,” that encompasses both a feature film and TV series, and which he says has been financed entirely by Russian TV, without any state support. He hopes to premiere the film in Cannes 2017.
In comparison with recent screen versions of Tolstoy’s literary epic, such as Joe Wright’s 2012 adaptation, he says that his version will be intimately linked to Tolstoy’s novel and he thinks will shed new light on the story.
Shakhnazarov added that his 2012 pic “White Tiger” was able to generate significant commercial revenues, including a strong theatrical release in Russia and significant sales abroad.
“If you have the choice it’s better to work without state support. I feel much more independent that way.”
The main problem facing Russian cinema is that only 70-80 films are made per year, whereas in the Soviet Union, 300 films were made a year, he added.
In terms of TV production, he estimated that Russia produces around 600 titles per year.
“We have some more mainstream films and a lot of artistic auteur films. I see no difference between the two. The problem is always that it must be a good film. For me it comes down to that – whether it’s a good or a bad film. And we need to produce more good films.”",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

The conference was organized by the USAID-funded Enterprise Development and Market Competitiveness (EDMC) Project, the SCPEC, and the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham).
The objective of the conference was to share knowledge and best practices in identifying and combating anti-competitive practices, especially in regards to businesses operating in USAID/EDMC-supported value chains – i.e. food processing, pharmaceuticals/biotechnology, hospitality, and information technologies.
SCPEC Chairman Shaboyan noted that economic competition is not only important for Armenia’s economic growth and prosperity, but also for enabling a competitive position in the international market and for protecting consumer rights. The Chairman called upon all participants to refer competition issues to the Commission.
The USAID-funded Enterprise Development and Market Competitiveness (EDMC) Project seeks to improve Armenia’s business environment and support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The pirates said they had abandoned the UAE-owned MT Royal Grace, which was seized off Oman last March. The European Union's anti-piracy taskforce said one of its warships patrolling off Somalia had provided food, water and medical assistance to the ship's crew.
""We got off the vessel late last night. We happily divided the cash among ourselves,"" a pirate who identified himself only as Ismail told Reuters by telephone.
Civil war after the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 left Somalia without effective central government and full of weapons. The turmoil opened the doors for piracy to flourish in the Gulf of Aden and deeper into the Indian Ocean.
Said Mohamed Rage, minister of ports and anti-piracy for Puntland - a region in northeast Somalia - confirmed the ransom and the release of the Panama-registered vessel.
It was not clear what cargo the tanker was carrying or who paid to free the vessel, but typically ship owners and the owners of cargo pay ransoms through insurance policies.
In 2011, Somali pirates preying on the waterways linking Europe with Africa and Asia netted $160 million and cost the world economy about $7 billion, according to U.S.-based think tank the One Earth Future foundation.
But the number of successful pirate attacks has since fallen dramatically as international navies have stepped up patrols to protect marine traffic and struck at pirate bases on the Somali coast, prompted by soaring shipping costs, including insurance.
Shipping firms have also increasingly deployed armed guards and laid out razor wire on their vessels to deter attacks.

A written response by the German Foreign Ministry to federal legislators said that Turkey had suspended Kivanc from the post on Monday 'with immediate effect.' It was not made public till Thursday.

In September, a Moscow-based European business lobby group, the AEB, wrote a letter to EU and Russian governments asking for business ties to be kept functional.
“Businessmen from the U.S. are also opposed to the sanctions, but cannot come out in the open,” Medvedev continued.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov issued a similar statement, and said the European Union may face a €40 billion loss this year due to sanctions.
Medvedev went on to say that sanctions have never been constructive. “Let’s recall a little history. When sanctions were imposed on the Soviet Union in 1925, we could not pay with gold for various imported products but we survived somehow,” he said.
Medvedev gave the example of how sanctions were imposed on the USSR in 1948 after the allied victory in World War II. The economic sanctions lasted more than 50 years and restricted exports to the Soviet Union.
Throughout the Cold War era the U.S. imposed sanctions and embargoes against China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Iran. “Have sanctions on Iran produced any result? I don’t think they’ve had a serious impact. Sanctions on the People’s Republic of China were adopted after the political events of 1989. I believe China went on to substantially speed up economic development. It’s time to return to reality,” the Prime Minister said.
The Kremlin and White House tit-for-tat sanctions have been escalating since March, after Crimea was annexed to Russia.
The U.S. and EU have introduced several waves of sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen, and some of their assets, as well as major banks, oil, and defense companies. The latest round came into effect on September 12.

It was impossible to verify the report independently, and sporadic famines are commonplace in North Korea, according to experts based in South Korea. A United Nations analysis in 2011 showed that around a third of children were malnourished.
The report from Rimjin-gang/ASIAPRESS said that, based on its own reporting from the region and from contact with North Korean defectors and people crossing the border, a famine hit the North and South Hwanghae provinces in January-May 2012.
""Farming villages in the Hwanghae region, and especially in southern Hwanghae province, play an important part as a base for food supply for not just the army but also for city workers,"" the report, published last week, said.

Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a last remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city. They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
""The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations,"" Darwish said, adding militant sleeper cells in the city were still a threat.
The SDF, with heavy air support from a U.S.-led coalition, said last week they had taken almost complete control of Manbij, where a small number of IS fighters had been holed up.
The SDF's offensive, which began at the end of May, aims to remove Islamic State from areas it controls along the Turkish border.
The Manbij operation in which U.S. special forces have played a significant role on the ground marks the most ambitious advance by a group allied to Washington in Syria since the United States launched its military campaign against Islamic State two years ago.
Manbij's loss to the militants is a big blow as it is of strategic importance, serving as a conduit for transit of foreign jihadists and provisions coming from the Turkish border.
Earlier the alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters grouped in the SDF said Friday's operation was ""the last operation and the last assault.""
Darwish said earlier roughly 100 Islamic State fighters were left in the city center using civilians as human shields, some of whom were killed trying to flee.
Reuters pictures showed residents being released from an Islamic State-held neighborhood on Friday and being welcomed by SDF forces.
Kurdish sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria's five-year-old conflict, later said around 500 cars had left Manbij carrying Islamic State members and civilians. They were heading northeast towards Jarablus, a town under Islamic State control on the Turkish border, the Observatory said.
The convoy carried the final Islamic State members leaving the city, under an agreement between the fighting parties that would not be announced officially, Kurdish sources and the monitor said, marking the end of the operation.
The SDF's campaign quickly captured the countryside surrounding Manbij, but slowed once fighting entered the city. The SDF said it had been avoiding a large-scale assault inside Manbij out of concern for civilians.
Dozens of civilians, including children and women from Manbij who had fled the city at the height of the aerial strikes, were killed in suspected U.S. coalition air strikes last month, residents and monitors said.

The main player in the region is the U.S., which is interested in stability in the Near East and Caucasus. This power's wish to push Russia from the South Caucasus, specifically from Armenia, is also an important factor. Professor of international relations and politics of the Universidad de San Andrés in Buenos Aires, Dr Khachik Ter-Ghukassian comments to PanARMENIAN.Net on the ongoing events in the region and their possible impact on Armenia.
The international community attaches big importance to the events taking place in the Neat East. How do you assess the current situation?

The Near East is of great interest for Washington. It specifically refers to the Caucasus. The U.S. is perfectly aware that war with Iran will redouble instability in the region while Washington needs ""an arc of stability"" from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. First of all, it concerns oil. The U.S. stands for cooperation but the situation is tensed, if not explosive. Although, Washington has intentions to improve relations with Iran. 

However, certain difficulties may cause internal developments in the Caucasus. It's quite possible that the map of the Near East may change. Anyway, there are some preconditions for it. The U.S. plans a ""mild"" division of Iraq with further formation of independent Kurdistan. At the same time I should stress that U.S. presence in Iraq doesn't alleviate tension. Unfortunately, the Arab world lacks either political or intellectual force capable to change the situation.

Normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations becomes more urgent for the United States. Can Washington have its will?

At the moment Turkey's foreign policy is targeted at Northern Iraq and improvement of relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan, what includes development of communications and military-strategic partnership. If Turkey's succeeds in realizing its plans Armenia will be isolated from the world. Curiously enough, such state of things is not convenient for the U.S. which insists on opening of the Armenian-Turkish border. However, normalization of relations without preconditions is a dangerous tendency. Turkey doesn't open the border proceeding from political reasons: the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the Armenian Genocide and absence of fixed border with Armenia. The only legal basis for demarcation of borders is the Sevr Treaty. No agreement signed after Sevr, namely the Kars and Moscow treaties, do not have juridical effect, since the signatory powers stopped their existence as elements of international law. The Sevr Treaty was signed August 10, 1920. Borders with independent Armenia had to be marked by a neutral mediator, namely the United States, according to it. 

At that we should not forget that Turkey has always been the biggest danger for the Armenian people. This opinion should be shared by the whole nation, both in Armenia and Diaspora. On the other hand, opening of borders can tell on Armenia's economy. Georgia, where the local industry was destroyed because of the abundant flow of cheap Turkish goods, can serve as an example. Certainly, Armenian economy can't compete with the Turkish, but we will have an outlet to the world, at least. Although, we are not ready to make a reality of the scenario we will be offered.

Iran and Armenia enjoy lasting and friendly ties. How would you comment on them?

If the United States collides with Turkey over Northern Iraq and simultaneously improves relations with Iran, it will be the best scenario for Armenia. Actually, under circumstances Russia's presence as a security guarantor for Armenia will lose urgency. We should strengthen relations with Iran. 

Iran is a minority in the Islamic world, since it practices Shi'ism. This state is the potential regional power. Will Washington have a political force to hold a dialogue with Iran as equals? This is the core of the problem. How the balance will be maintained between the Sunnis (al Qaeda) and Shiites? How the Lebanese problem will be resolved. These are questions that need exact answers. Under any circumstances, the Armenia-Iran relations should be apart any shocks in the region.

220 members of the House of Representatives have supported the Armenian Genocide Resolution. Do you think it will be put on vote?

The U.S. government will use the H.Res.106 as the main took of pressure on Turkey. Struggle between Democrats and Republicans as well as the presidential elections in the United States may speed up or, on the contrary, protract the decision. If Washington is really interested in normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations it will press on Turkey with this Resolution. As to the opinion, that passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution is necessary for the Armenian community of the U.S., I am convinced that opposing Armenia and Diaspora in the Genocide issue is dangerous and immoral.

Argentina is among the states that recognized the Armenian Genocide. How efficient are the activities of the Armenian community of Argentina?

Argentina is the second, after France, state where the Armenian Genocide is recognized on the legislative level. The history of the Genocide is a compulsory subject in schools of Buenos Aires. The Hay Dat Argentinean Office has organized a special textbook. It also holds seminars for school teachers.

I would like to note that Venezuela, which is far enough from the major states of South America, has also recognized the Armenian Genocide. In the 1980-ies Armenians of Argentina and other South American states started integration into in the society. We have become a part of the countries, which gave us shelter. We should proceed on this way basing on the example of the Armenian community of France.

The President's proposal of $18,360,000 in Economic Support Funds for Armenia in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 would, if approved by Congress, represent a record low in such aid since Armenia's independence. The White House's proposal for Armenia is over $2 million less than FY 2014's actual economic aid allocation, and less than half of the $40 million requested in a Congressional Armenian Caucus letter and ANCA Congressional testimony submitted last year.
""The White House must match its relentless reductions in aid to Armenia with an equally energetic effort to substantially increase bilateral trade and investment between our two nations,"" stated ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian. ""It's not too late for President Obama, who came into office promising to grow U.S.-Armenia economic relations, to negotiate a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, put in place a badly-needed new Tax Treaty, and organize targeted trade missions promoting cooperation in IT, health care, education, tourism and other key sectors of Armenia's economy.""
The White House's proposal did, however, maintain parity in terms of appropriated military aid, with International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance set at $600,000 and Foreign Military Finance (FMF) at $1,700,000.

Iraq also announced the execution of 26 men convicted of ""terrorism"" on Tuesday, Jan 21, the latest in a sharp increase in Baghdad's use of capital punishment as violence has spiked.

The authorities have sharply increased their use of capital punishment as violence has surged in the past year, executing 169 people in 2013, the highest annual figure since the 2003 US-led invasion and the third highest in the world, behind just China and Iran.

The jubilee Summit of BSEC ended with the adoption of the concluding declaration, where the participants of the Summit spoke of their intention to make the Black Sea region a stable and prosperous part of Europe. The BSEC member countries have agreed upon expending the cooperation especially in the sphere of energy.
June 26, 2007
PanARMENIAN.Net - In the document the parties announced about a number of important events. ""The initiative regarding the project of the regional cooperation in the Black Sea region justified all the efforts. Regarding this the parties are willing to continue the further consolidation of the role of BSEC as an active and reliable partner in the regional and international affairs. We confirm the wish to strengthen the cooperation in the sphere of energy taking into account the interests of the countries, which produce, use and transfer it,"" the Declaration states. 

According to the Turkish Prime Minister Redgep Erdoghan the Istanbul Summit will be the turning point in the BSEC activity. ""At last we began the realization of the practical projects. The joint economic projects among the countries will help to find ways to conflict resolution in the region and to establish friendly relationship between the countries of the Black Sea Region,"" mentioned the Turkish Prime-Minister. However the Turkish mass media put Erdoghan's ambitious plans about building a joint future in doubt. The skepticism was caused by the announcement made by the RA Minister of Foreign Affairs Vartan Oskanyan, saying that for developing economic and commercial relations between Armenia and Turkey, Ankara should first of all open the borders with Armenia and recognize the Armenian Genocide. ""If you take the dialogue between Yerevan and Ankara seriously, be so kind to first of all open the borders. If the Armenian-Turkish border is opened, the Armenian side will be ready to establish cooperation on the government level for discussing the problems which impede the normalization of the relations between our countries,"" noted Vartan Oskanyan. 

Oskanyan also mentioned that the absence of the Armenian President can be explained with the absence of the diplomatic relations between Armenia and Turkey. ""Black Sea has united us during many centuries. Today we have the same possibility though we don't take advantage of this chance in our interest. Sometimes the water is so deep that we prefer to stay away from it. I think that the political potential of BSEC isn't completely covered,"" underlined the Head of the RA Department of Foreign Policy. 

Vartan Oskanyan also spoke about the Karabakh Conflict, underlining that ""the people of Nagorno-Karabakh have the right of self-determination and security"", which was followed by Ilham Aliyev's usual answer, ""The war is not over. Only the first stage is over. The present situation can't go on forever and we will not let our territories ""in occupation"". Strangely enough nothing was said about the refugees, though he didn't forget to mention about the 20% of the Azeri territories that ""Armenia has to vacate immediately"". 

One of the most important achievements of the summit of the Organization of Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) is that EU was granted the status of observer in BSEC. According to RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs it is only the first step. ""Equal and mutually beneficial cooperation will give a boost to building the Big Europe with no separating lines,"" believes the First Deputy of the RF Minister of Foreign Affairs Denisov. However everything is not as smooth as Russia believes. According to the economist Fatiha Arslan, the Black Sea region plays a greater role for energy transportation. ""We support the Russian project of establishing a joint energy circle which would allow connecting all the energy systems of the European countries in the Black Sea region. As the Russian President assures each country will have free access to the source. However in Turkey truthfulness of such announcements are in doubt and it is assured that such announcements are dictated by the desire of gaining control over the energy transportation,"" he believes.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

The State Committee of Real Estate Cadastre at the Armenian government has presented the current situation in the RA real estate market, as well as forecasts for the year. The Committee’s specialists predict some activation in the Armenian real estate market but decrease in prices is unlikely in the near future.
May 8, 2010
PanARMENIAN.Net - The construction industry has had a huge share in the GDP structure in recent years, and the country’s economic growth has been secured due to its development. Thus, it is not strange that the global financial-economic crisis has affected the Armenian real estate market since August 2008. The number of transactions conducted during this period decreased by 10.6% as compared with August of 2007. The prices for real estate have started going down and 1.8% decrease was recorded in August as compared with July 2008.

The situation in the real estate market has started improving since September 2009: growth has been recorded both in the number of deals and in prices for real estate. Thus, 6.1% growth was recorded in deals made in September as compared with August 2009, while prices increased by 0.8% and 0.6% in Yerevan and regions respectively. 36,499 transactions were made in the first quarter of 2010 that is 24.3% lower as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and 27.9% higher as compared with the first quarter of 2009. Kotayk and Ararat regions were the most active in the market, these regions’ share in the total number of deals totaled 13.6% and 8.4% respectively. Meanwhile 32.2% of the transactions were made in Yerevan. Some positive trends are observed in the real estate market throughout Armenia. For example, 49.8% of the entire transactions were made in regions in 2001, while this figure amounted to 58.2% in 2004 and 67.8% in the first quarter of 2010.

The market price for 1 square meter in apartment buildings increased by 2.6% in Yerevan and by 1.5% in other cities of the republic in the first quarter of 2009. Meanwhile the highest prices for apartments in Yerevan are continuously recorded in Kentron (Center) district – AMD 470,600 per square meter, while the lowest prices are in Nubarashen district – AMD 143,300 per square meter. Meanwhile, the average price for apartments in Yerevan totaled 271,400 per square meter as of the first quarter of 2010. The prices per square meter in other districts of Yerevan are as follows: Arabkir – AMD 373,900, Kanaker-Zeytun – AMD 283,500, Nor Nork – AMD 234,800, Avan – AMD 235,900, Erebuni – AMD 248,000, Davitashen – AMD 270,300, Ajapnyak – AMD 239,300, Malatsia-Sebastia – AMD 236,700.

As for the regions, the highest prices for real estate were recorded in Kotayk and Armavir regions, amounting to AMD 160,000 per square meter in Abovian and AMD 156,900 - in Etchmiadzin. Relatively low prices were recorded in Tavush, Gegharkunik and Lori regions of Armenia.

2.9% growth was recorded in prices for private houses in Yerevan and Armenia’s regions, totaling 281,100 per square meter in Yerevan on an average. Again, the highest and lowest prices were recorded in Kentron and Nubarashen districts of Yerevan – AMD 484,200 and AMD 147,000 respectively.

Today, Armenia’s financial market faces the challenge of “long-term money” that can be tackled through decrease in interest rates for mortgage loans. The Armenian government has initiated two programs – National Mortgage Company UCO and Affordable Housing for Young Families – to facilitate the mortgage lending. In addition, it has provided state guarantees to construction companies to overcome this difficult period. Thus, some growth has been recorded in mortgage lending since the beginning of this year. It should be noted that the interest rates considerably decreased in 2009, making 8.5-13% against 16-20% two years ago. Population displays greater interest and, hopefully, the market will become even more active by the end of this year. Besides, construction volumes in Armenia may increase in the near future, due to economic growth recorded in Russia and Ukraine that will contribute to increase in remittances.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Three of them are in Apure state. The others are in the state of Zulia, parts of which had already been placed under a state of emergency.
The move is part of a crackdown on crime near the border, where smugglers and guerrilla groups are active. The crackdown has heightened tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.

Under the Venezuelan constitution, a state of emergency can be declared if the security of the country, its citizens or its institutions are at risk. It temporarily restricts some constitutional rights and allows security forces to search homes without a warrant.
President Maduro took the measure after three soldiers and a civilian were injured in an attack in San Antonio del Tachira near the border last month.
The 2,200km-long border (1,400 miles) between is porous and there has historically been a steady flow of people both ways. It is also a haven for smugglers, who make an easy profit buying subsidised goods cheaply in Venezuela and selling them at much higher prices in Colombia.

Funerals of dead protesters could act as further flashpoints for demonstrators emboldened by uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt that toppled long-ruling presidents.

The Macroeconomic Overview notes that the increase in production capacities and in basic exports, despite unfavorable prices at international commodity markets and weaker external demand, were instrumental in securing 4.4% year-on-year GDP growth in quarter one of 2016.
In April 2016, the economic activity index grew to 6.8% against the same period in 2015, securing a 6% growth for the first four months of 2016 in annual terms. According to the National Statistical Service of Armenia, economic activity index in January-May amounted to 5.5%.

The price of Brent crude collapsed from $115 in June to $45.19, the lowest in almost six years, in January due to oversupply. Since January, mounting signs of lower industry spending have helped prices move higher.
Apache Corp, a top U.S. shale oil producer, said on Thursday it would cut capital spending and its rig count in 2015 following the price collapse, keeping its output growth mostly flat.
Brent for April delivery was up 76 cents at $60.04 by 0917 GMT, after briefly gaining more than $1. The March contract expired overnight. U.S. crude was up 61 cents at $51.82.

The Prime Minister briefed the guests on the current tasks and the challenges ahead of Armenia and its newly formed government and described the steps to take for their solution. Among priority actions, he named the efforts towards mitigating the impact of increased commodity prices, improving and reforming tax and customs administrations, achieving higher efficiency in the fight against corruption, getting the opposition involved in the execution of the government program, as well as providing for possibly greater transparency and publicity in all these processes. The parties have also referred to Armenia-Turkey relations and the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The development of EU-Armenia cooperation under the European Neighborhood Policy and the continuation of efforts towards the implementation of the ENP Action Plan have been emphasized on either side.



The Prime Minister advised that the price problem is being discussed with the World Bank and the IMF currently in order to take remedial action as soon as possible.

The highest food inflation rates were in the Kyrgyz Republic (27 percent) and in Georgia (23 percent). Energy inflation is also the highest among the lower income countries of the region, World Bank and IMF experts said at the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings 2011.
Despite the nascent recovery, many ECA countries are still grappling with lower wages and higher unemployment resulting from the global crisis. If no countervailing measures are undertaken, and unemployment does not fall fast enough, the increases in food and energy prices could push 5.3 million more people across the region into poverty, with most of the higher poverty due to the food price increases.
Poverty could increase in some of the lower income countries of the region. Potential increases in poverty rates could reach 11 percentage points for the Kyrgyz Republic, 9 for Armenia and Georgia, 8 for Tajikistan, and around 5 percentage points for Moldova. Elevated food and energy prices will also put these countries’ external balances under strain, along with Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Montenegro, and hence increase their external financing needs.

The announcement made by Tachi evoked the predictable reaction of the EU, as one of the members of the international ""three"" on identifying the status of Kosovo, which replaced the UNO after the failure of the Ahtisaari plan. The truth is that at present moment the UNO is too concentrated on the Near East, to really take an interest in the Balkans and that's why is willing to solve this problem as soon as possible.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States call upon the Kosovo Albanians to refrain from one-sided declaration of independence, whereas Washington promises to recognize the independence of the country already in January. Russia's viewpoint is clear; it is against the separation from Serbia and suggests ""wide autonomy"" instead. Practically the world found itself in a diplomatic deadlock, which is fraught with inner tensions in the Balkans. The truth is that the EU special representative for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby is more optimistic about things. ""I hope that the declaration of independence of Kosovo will not become a destabilizing factor in the Balkans,"" he said also adding that in this case the disposition of the EU depends on the fact that the Kosovo problem is a special case. ""Every conflict has its own history, its specific character and every conflict needs an individual approach, respecting the international law. The resolution of the Kosovo problem must not have any influence on the resolution of other conflicts but perhaps it is inevitable that Kosovo will give birth to hopes or apprehensions for other unsolved problems. Nevertheless, the EU is always for the resolution of any kind of conflict exceptionally from point of view of international law,"" emphasized the Finnish diplomat. In his turn the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden Carl Bildt announced that Hashim Tachi must understand the difference between the announcements made by an oppositional politician and by responsible political figures. 

Several years ago Carl Bildt was the active mediator in the negotiations held over the issue of the status of Kosovo, which he called ""the most sensitive region in Europe, where any abrupt movement may be fatal"".

Turkish and Azerbaijani officials reportedly are seriously mulling the possibility of Armenian participation in the long-planned Nabucco pipeline project as part of a comprehensive Karabakh peace pact, EurasiaNet reports.



Turkey is leading efforts to energize the Karabakh peace process. Turkish, Armenian and Azerbaijani officials met in New York on September 26 to discuss the Karabakh issue and other security matters. That meeting kindled hopes that a settlement could be achieved by the end of 2008.



Although details of the recent discussions have been scarce, some experts believe that the three sides have probed a possible bargain under which Armenia would become part of the Nabucco pipeline plans, in return for a greater degree of flexibility concerning Yerevan's position on Karabakh.



Yerevan's willingness to modify its long-standing demand for Karabakh independence would appear to be the key as to whether this latest push for Karabakh peace can be successful. Azerbaijani officials seem willing to work with Armenia on the Nabucco project, if Yerevan shows sufficient flexibility on Karabakh. ""Of course, Azerbaijan has set political conditionality related to the Karabakh conflict on this [Nabucco] issue,"" Elhan Shahinoglu, the director of the Baku-based Atlas center for political research, said.



Turkish analyst Sinan Ogan, the chair of the Ankara-based TURKSAM think tank, said that the topic of Armenia's participation in the Nabucco project came up during US Vice President Dick Cheney's recent, controversial visit to Baku. ""There are serious plans to involve Armenia in this project. Turkey and Azerbaijan were against this idea at first, but now Armenia's participation seems realistic,"" Ogan said in comments broadcast September 19 on Voice of America radio.



Initial indicators are that the three sides did not make significant headway on the Karabakh issue during the September 26 meeting in New York.

According to the letter Azerbaijan has launched a fraudulent campaign aimed at misleading the international community and justifying its policy of using force or threat of force against the people of Nagorno Karabakh.
“The rehabilitation of the Stepanakert airport is the sovereign right of the NKR and pursues solely civilian and humanitarian objectives, including realization of such a basic human right as freedom of movement. Freedom of movement of the civilian population of the NKR alongside with other human rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other core international instruments have already been continuously and vehemently undermined by the ongoing Azerbaijani blockade. This stance of Azerbaijan is a clear manifestation of its upright disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms as a continuation of its policy of collective punishment of civilian population,” NKR Foreign Minister’s letter reads.
“The threats of Azerbaijan to shoot down civil aircrafts in particular, violates the provisions of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and runs counter to the commitments undertaken in the framework of the negotiation process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair states, to reject any threat or use of force against civil aircraft, pursue the matter through diplomatic steps, and refrain from politicizing the issue.
Such threats, along with the statements on the highest level declaring all Armenians of the world as enemy number one of Azerbaijan are a vivid example of the long-established anti-Armenian hysteria and xenophobia of the Azeri state policy. The pardon and nationwide glorification of Ramil Safarov, Azerbaijani officer, who was convicted to the life imprisonment in Hungary for perpetuating brutal hate crime, a manslaughter, is the most shocking yet just recent manifestation of this policy. In this context, my Government considers the steps taken by the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in particular declarations on undertaking “all necessary measures” in order to prevent the functioning of the Stepanakert Airport along with previous threats to shoot down civil planes as irresponsible and politically charged actions,” the letter ran.
Minister Mirzoyan called upon the UN Secretary General, the UN and its specialized agencies, as well as all peace-loving Member States to assist in the rehabilitation of the Stepanakert airport to ensure that the people of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic are able to exercise their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Sharmazanov said Sargsyan submitted resignation a month ago, however the President insisted that the PM should not leave the post unless the Constitutional Court rules on the controversial pension reform, according to Novosti Armenia.
In a Facebook post, Sargsyan said it was a well-considered decision while Sharmazanov said personal issues were involved as well.
Armenia's Constitutional Court declared controversial clauses to the law on cumulative pensions invalid on April 2. At a hearing on Wednesday, the court ruled that provisions imposing mandatory cumulative pension system are at conflict with the country's basic law. The court decision noted that the law fails to indicate requirements for those with minimum salaries of AMD 45000, with every citizen entitled to a salary no lower than a minimum one. According to the Constitutional Court, the government and parliament must protect the citizens’ right to ownership. The disputed provisions, which went into effect on January 1, obligated all employed citizens under 40 to allocate 5% of their monthly salaries to cumulative accounts, with the government to add another 5%.

Returning to a subject that had captivated him since the 1860s, the artist used the classical subject of bathers from the grand French tradition as a compositional tool for a completely new and free aesthetic. The masterful use of translucent patches of watercolour renders the human figures almost weightless – the nudes are fully embraced by nature. Adding to the rarity of the richly-composed and vibrant artwork, the triangular composition reveals a view of Montagne Sainte-Victoire. Thus, in such a small scale, Cézanne is able to perfectly capture the most important subjects and ideas that formed his artistic legacy. A generation of artists saw a new world of possibility in his innovative use of space and light and, in just a few square inches, the very DNA of Picasso’s inspiration for Cubism and his iconic Les Demoiselles d'Avignon can be found. Dating from the last period of his life, and appearing at auction for the first time in almost three decades, Baigneuses, La Montagne Sainte-Victoire au fond is estimated to bring £4 – 6 million as the cover-lot of Sotheby’s inaugural Actual Size sale on 21 June, Art Daily reports.
The illustrious provenance of this work further underpins its quality and desirability, having been included in two of the greatest single owner sales in Sotheby’s 273-year history. Its story began in the collection of Cézanne’s son, also named Paul, and found its way into the legendary collection of German industrialist Robert von Hirsch – who had assembled one of the world’s most significant collections encompassing Impressionist and Modern paintings, alongside Old Master and Medieval works of art. In June 1978, a series of seven sales of von Hirsch’s collection at Sotheby’s made history – with the extraordinary total making front-page news on most English newspapers – to this day it is considered to be one of the most successful auctions ever. It was in this sale that the work was bought by the British Rail Pension Fund for £140,000 ($259,000). In the mid-1970s, the British Rail Pension Fund made the bold decision to invest in art – perplexing their pensioners and stunning fund managers. The Impressionist collection formed 10% of the total amount and proved the strategy successful in April 1989 when twenty-five works acquired for £3.4 million sold at Sotheby’s for a combined total of £35.2 million.
A masterpiece in its own right, this work also relates closely to one of the three late Grandes baigneuses that Cézanne was working on at the time of his death, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Cézanne’s watercolours and drawings will be the subject of an extensive exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Basel from June until September 2017.
In June this year, to coincide with its flagship sales in London, Sotheby’s will stage a deceptively ‘small’ sale. Bringing together a range of works from across the 20th and 21st centuries, with occasional surprises from earlier moments, this first-of-its-kind sale will include a broad mix of exceptional paintings, sculptures and works on paper which share one common characteristic – each one will be no bigger than the size of the catalogue page on which it is illustrated, in ‘Actual Size’.
Thomas Bompard, Head of Sotheby’s London Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sales and Curator of Actual Size, said: “At just five by eight inches, this show-stopping watercolour has all the power and grandeur of a great Renaissance fresco. All of Cézanne's genius is right here: like a magician, he conjures form from nothing more than light and colour; and in this rare moment he brings together the two subjects he held dearest. It's a major tour de force on a miniature scale. It's the father of modernism at his best. And for many reasons, the perfect cover lot for Actual Size”.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

Asatryan also believes that the pension reforms have been failed in Armenia. “It had been decided to adopt all relevant laws in 2010, with voluntary and compulsory pension systems to start operating from 2011.

The Qatari Investment Authority (QIA) has been in competition with two Chinese insurance companies, Ping An and China Life, to buy the 656ft tower, which is London’s largest office building, from South Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS).
The tower has made – and lost – considerable sums for its owners in recent years.
In 2009 NPS bought it from HSBC for $1.3bn, which means that, on paper at least, the Korean firm has realized a profit of $500mln in only five years.
HSBC took the building over in 2008 after its owner, the Spanish property company Metrovacesa was hit by the financial crash. Metrovacesa bought it for $1.76bn in 2006.
HSBC has a 13-year lease on the building and an agreement that links rent increases to the UK retail prices index.
The deal is the third largest in the UK in recent years, behind Blackstone’s sale of 50% of the City of London’s Broadgate complex to Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund for $2.7bn, and Armenian billionaire Dikran Izmirlian’s sale of More London to St Martin, a state-owned Kuwaiti property company, for about the same amount.
The QIA already owns a number of London landmarks, including Harrods department store, the London Stock Exchange and the Shard tower at London Bridge.
The fate of the HSBC tower, which was designed by Foster + Partners and completed in 2002, contrasts sharply with the Gherkin tower in the City of London, which was designed by the same firm and built in 2004.
The owners of the Gherkin (its proper name is 30 St Mary Axe), IVG Immobilien, called in the receivers in April after it defaulted on bank loans.
The German company had bought the tower at the height of the property boom using a loan denominated in Swiss francs that appreciated by 60%.

Lee's control of the company, a special prosecutor said in a statement on Monday, March 6, Reuters reports.
In a statement detailing the findings of its investigation, the special prosecutor's office said the National Pension Service voted in favor of a merger of two Samsung Group affiliates in 2015, despite anticipating a 138.8 billion won ($119.87 million) loss.
""Samsung Group vice chairman Lee Jae-yong colluded with others including the corporate strategy office chief Choi Gee-sung to bribe the president and Choi Soon-sil with an aim to receive support for his succession by embezzling corporate funds,"" special prosecutor Park Young-soo told a televised news conference, referring to the Samsung chief's Korean name.
Park, Choi and Lee have all denied wrongdoing. Samsung Group did not immediately have comment, but has in the past denied it ever paid bribes or sought improper favors from Park.
The investigation looked into an influence-peddling scandal involving Park, who was impeached by parliament in December after accusations she had colluded with her long-time friend Choi to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back the president's policy initiatives.
The 65-year-old daughter of a former military strongman has had her powers suspended. The Constitutional Court will rule on whether to uphold parliament's December impeachment of Park. The court is expected to hand down its decision sometime in March.
Should it uphold the impeachment, Park would become the country's first democratically elected president to be thrown out of office and spark an election in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
Lee, a third-generation leader of the Samsung tech giant ""chaebol"", and four other executives, were last week charged with bribery and embezzlement over the corruption scandal.
Lee is accused of pledging 43 billion Korean won ($37.19 million) in bribes to a company and organizations backed by Park's confidant Choi to curry favor and cement his control of the conglomerate.

The newspaper said that while there was opposition to the deal in Germany's Chancellery, Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry, there was support for it within the Economy Ministry.
""The Saudi order could secure the future of German tank-makers Krauss-Maffei Wegman and Rheinmetall, which urgently need new markets because of the restructuring of the German army,"" said Bild am Sonntag.
A German government spokeswoman declined to comment.
Last year, Germany denied reports that it had agreed to export 270 Leopard tanks to Saudi Arabia. Exports of military equipment cannot be officially acknowledged as they are confidential and disclosure is punishable by a fine or jail.
Opposition lawmakers heaped pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel's government after reports it had cut a secret deal to sell the tanks, saying it contravened the country's export guidelines for military hardware.
Arms exports are a sensitive issue in Germany given its Nazi past as well as the role arms makers like Krupp played in feeding 19th and 20th century wars with exports to both sides of conflicts.

""In addition,"" the report continues, ""a small extension to an existing building appears to have been constructed.""
Critics of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran are likely to seize on this detail of the report.

""So there wouldn't be any IAEA or other restrictions on new construction at that site were they to occur,"" he said.

The communications equipment and other items are being funneled for now only to non-armed opposition groups, the U.S. officials said.
But the move nevertheless boosts Syria's beleaguered rebels, who saw their international support slide after Islamic militants seized bases near the Turkish border that had been under the authority of a key U.S.-backed leader.
It could also be seen as a U.S. reward to the opposition for its participation in ongoing peace talks with President Bashar Assad's government in Geneva.
The U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity, said the aid was being sent through Turkey into Syria, with the coordination of the Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council, led by Gen. Salim Idris, a secular-minded, Western-backed moderate.
They stressed that the halt in supplies last month was only a ""precautionary measure"" until the Obama administration could once again verify the security of aid packages, according to the AP.
Items taken in December from the Bab al-Hawa crossing between Syria and Turkey have since been returned, the officials said, and U.S.-supported rebel groups have taken steps to prevent future supplies from being diverted.
Direct, nonlethal U.S. assistance to armed Syrian rebel units could resume soon, U.S. officials said. They provided no indication about the status of lethal assistance such as body armor and ammunition.
Britain also suspended deliveries some six weeks ago and Turkey shut its side of the border as fears over the growing strength of extremist jihadis crystallized in the takeover of the warehouses and bases by the Islamic Front, a new alliance of six of the most powerful Islamic rebel groups in Syria.
It was a stark demonstration of how Idris's influence had diminished amid the rise of al Qaeda-affiliated militants flush with cash, weapons and battleground experience.
More than 100,000 people have died in Syria's civil war, now in its third year. Internationally brokered peace talks began last week in Switzerland, but have made little to no headway, with most of the discussions centered on improving access for humanitarian groups and potential prisoner releases.

Development of the AK-12 began in mid-2011. The new weapon retains the overall layout and features of the AK-74, in service with the Russian army since the 1970s, but features several modifications and ergonomic changes.
The new assault rifle has being developed as a basic platform for nearly 20 different modifications of the weapon. It could be adapted for cartridges varying from 5.45x39 mm to 7.62x51 NATO.
According to Izhmash designers, they “have adapted the weapon to modern combat requirements, having preserved Kalashnikov's unique qualities - simplicity, reliability and relatively low production cost.”
The rifle features three firing modes: single shot, three-shot burst and automatic fire. The muzzle of the AK-12 has been designed to shoot foreign-standard barrel-mounted grenades.
The weapon is also equipped with Picatinny rails to mount optical, and night sights, grenade launchers, target indicators and other special equipment.
The AK-12 has a folding stock, and a height-adjustable heelpiece. The weapon can be used by both left-handed and right-handed people, and can be easily handled with one hand.",no,N/A,,,,

The U.S. continues to render assistance to Armenia for formation of civil society and implementation of democratic reforms. As a co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, the U.S. promotes resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. However, the U.S. Embassy in Armenia has been functioning without Ambassador for 18 months already. PanARMENIAN.Net requested U.S. Charge d'Affairs Joseph Pennington to comment on the Armenian-American relations and development prospects.
What is the present level of Armenian-American relations? 

There is a historical aspect to it, with obviously deep cultural ties because of the Diaspora and there is, of course, also the political dimension of the relationshipand economics and trade and a business relationship as welland military relations, for that matter, through NATO. Of course all of those aspects of the relationship are important and our partnership in most of those areas is beyond question. And so I would say as a general comment, our relationship is very strong in the sense that we have cooperation across a broad range of issues. 

How would you describe the relationship in terms of political, economic developments? 

Obviously we believe that we have played a constructive role over the years, since the independence of Armenia, in Armenia's economic development and the development of democracy here. The U.S. government has allocated more than - or almost - 2 billion USD over the years in assistance to Armenia. And that continues today both in our ordinary bilateral assistance and also in the MCC Program. Of course the MCC program is also affected by political developments and reform. 

Is the suspension of MCC compact possible in Armenia? 

The short answer is yes, it is possible that there could be problems with the MCC program and Ambassador Danilovich has made that clear in letters to former President Kocharyan and President Sargsyan. And the reason for that is not because the United States is looking to reduce our support to Armenia or to punish Armenia is some way, but the reason is that the Millennium Challenge Program itself is based on an agreement between the U.S. government and the Armenian government that yes, the assistance will be provided, but also with the reforms in the democratic area. And the events around the election campaign, the election day, the recounts, the post-election situation that lead ultimately to violence and the state emergency - all of those things are things that called into question the current authorities' commitment to democratic reform. And so what we have said both privately to the government and publicly is that we want to continue the Millennium Challenge program because it will help hundreds of thousands of Armenians out in rural areas, but at the same time we can only do that if the authorities return Armenia to a democratic path and regain momentum on democratic development. 

Please speak about American-Armenian military cooperation both within the framework NATO and outside of it? 

Well, of course the most visible and well-known example of military cooperation is through the partnership program that Armenia has with NATO, which Armenia has made good progress on fulfilling the commitments under its purpose. There is also of course the cooperation and the contribution that Armenia has given on the ground in difficult places like Iraq and Kosovo which is tremendously appreciated by the United States. We specifically are very pleased that as of about a week ago, Armenian has doubled its commitment to troops on the ground in Kosovo. And at the same time, the United States military provides in a number of military areas assistance to Armenia whether it's for equipment, training, help with drafting strategic military documents and so on, civilization of the military. And so there are a lot of aspects to the military relationship which we think is developing well. 

Hearing on the nomination of the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia will start tomorrow? Will they be successful or not?

First of all, we are very pleased that we have a great nominee, Ambassador Yovanovitch. I think Armenia is very lucky that that appointment has been made. We look forward to her coming and she will do a fantastic job. Of course in our system, as you are aware, there is this Senate approval as required of the nomination and the process will start Thursday on the hearing. We are hopeful that the process will go without significant problem and that Senate will approve Ambassador Yovanovitch and that will happen quickly. We think Armenia deserves to have a fully represented U.S. mission here that includes an ambassador but of course the Senate has its own business to do and I can't predict the outcome, but we are hopeful that it will be positive and that we will have an ambassador soon. No one will be happier that I will be to see her to come. 

We are afraid that the story with Ambassador Hoagland will be repeated again.

I certainly hope not. I think it would be negative for both the United States and the U.S.-Armenian relationship but that is not in our hands, that's in the Senate's hands and we'll see how it comes out. 

Do you share the position of the Minsk Group as a Co-Chair country? 

Right, we have been through many years an active participant of the Minsk Group process and we see that process as the appropriate avenue. We were very pleased to see from statements through governments that the last meeting went well. And we hope that that meeting is something that can be built upon. We expect the co-chairs back in the region probably by the end of this month to start the next round of the process. But in our view, of course, there is no alternative. And we will continue working very hard with our partners. 

If Azerbaijan starts war, what will be the reactions of the United States? 

I am afraid that's just a hypothetical question that I can't really answer. But we would expect and hope that that hypothetical never comes to pass. 

Recently different ways of reconciliation have been observed on the public level between Turks and Armenians. Is it possible that these contacts might serve ground for further strengthening of the relationship? 

First of all, this is an extremely important issue in my view for both Turkey and Armenia for the future of both countries and for the stability in the region. I've worked now for many years of my career in both of those places and so I have a real personal interest in this issue. And we, you know the United States for a long time has supported increased cultural, social ties, the ties we call people-to-people contacts between Turks and Armenians. And just as an example, tomorrow night I am going to open a performance at Komitas Hall of the Bosporus Quartet of Istanbul. The Komitas Quartet performed in Istanbul last week. And it is one example. There are many projects like that that we support and will continue to support. We think that those kinds of contacts - conferences, exchanges, academic debates and so on, they help to break down barriers and ultimately help to push the political process forward. And we also continue to work at the levels of governments to try to encourage the two sides to take steps to overcome their differences. And we certainly hope that in the not-too-distant future there will be some progress at that level as well. 

You have worked in Turkey. How the treat Armenian? What is their attitude towards the events of 1915? 

It's a very interesting question. I first worked in Turkey from 1995-1998, so back 10-13 years ago, and I can say that the difference between those years and now in terms of this debate is very clear. I think there is a much greater willingness among many people in Turkey to talk more honestly about the past and look at those events more openly. And if you look in the Turkish media, you see a quite lively debate about Armenia and about Turkey and Armenia. And it's part of an overall opening in Turkey in terms of activating civil society and democratization. Of course, there are also problems, and we saw the convictions under article 301 in Turkey for a number of years and certainly there are still people who don't want to have this discussion and people who tragically were willing to resort to violence against Hrant Dink when he spoke about it. But I can tell you that I met with Hrant in the last week that I worked in Turkey back in 2006 and Hrant's approach was that the most important thing that we - all of us - Armenians, Turks and international community...Hrant was convinced that by improving that relationship, that would encourage a greater and more honest look at the past. And so that's the direction that we try to work in.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

One hundred and fifty-eight Russian senators thrust their support behind the permanent air force at the Syrian base in Khmeimim during the Wednesday, October 12 vote, with one senator abstaining.
“Russia’s Air Force group will be located in Syria only for defense purposes and does not target third countries,” Viktor Ozerov, chair of the Defense Committee in the Federation Council, told RIA Novosti after the vote.
Ozerov added the decision marks Russia’s “substantial input” into the international effort to stabilize the situation in Syria.
Last Friday the State Duma voted unanimously to ratify the treaty.
The treaty was signed on August 26, 2015 in Damascus and provides the legal grounds for the ongoing Russian operation in Syria.
According to the document, the Russian Air Force will act on the orders of its commander and in compliance with the Syrian authorities.
“Weapons, ammunition, equipment and materials necessary to perform the tasks of the Russian aviation group to ensure the safety and life of its personnel will be imported into Syria free of charge,” the documents says.
It adds that Russian personnel will be guaranteed immunity, as it would be the case with a diplomatic mission.
The official start of the Russian military operation in the Syrian Arab Republic was September 20, 2015, although construction works and relocation of military hardware to the Khmeimim airbase were apparent weeks before that.
The operation is logistically the most difficult that Russia has conducted in modern history, with dozens of ships transporting supplies across the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.
Russia deployed its warplanes and support troops to Syria in response to a request by Damascus. The stated goal was to prevent terrorist forces from overwhelming the Syrian Army, which would likely have resulted in massive purges of ethnic and religious minorities and turned the entire country into a hotbed of terrorism, potentially threatening Russia.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

One cannot call the geographical location of Armenia and the geopolitical situation in it successful, if the situation in the region suddenly gets out of control and there starts a war “all against all”. An option very pessimistic, but possible if Syria is split and Assad “leaves”. Following the fall of Assad, they will take on Iran, and Armenia will be caught not even between two fires, but in the flow of refugees from everywhere.
March 20, 2012
PanARMENIAN.Net - In our opinion in this case there would work the law of large numbers, i.e. roughly speaking there would win the one who would get most weapons and would regiment the largest number of soldiers. This does not include the various armed groups fighting on one side or another on the basis of religion, passions and simply money. As has been said, the war is between Sunnis and Shiites or, more generally, between the U.S. and Russia for hegemony on the vast territory from North Africa to Central Asia, or rather to China and India.

Our neighbors, namely Iran and Turkey, have huge armies, and just a slightest reason is enough for them to regiment over one million people on each side. And be there a will, a reason can always be found, especially when you consider the exorbitant ambitions of Turkey. Let us now compare the figures. Iranian armed forces consist of two independent agencies – the Army of the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Their total number reaches 523 thousand. Another 350,000 are registered in reserve, and 40-60 thousand people are employed by paramilitary agencies. In addition, there is the “Basij” Resistance Force, a volunteer paramilitary organization operating under the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which officially includes 12.6 million Iranians, including women and children.

Overall strength of the Turkish Armed Forces, excluding reservists, is 720,000 people. For full mobilization in wartime the military trained reserve of up to 90,000 people can also be used, including 38,000 reservists of the first stage.

Armies in the South Caucasus states are, naturally, less both in number and in technical equipment, which in a modern war plays a significant role, to say the least.

The overall strength of the Armed Forces of Georgia used to be 39,000 people in 2011. Mobilization forces - 140 thousand people. The Armed Forces of Azerbaijan comprise 66,940 men, of whom 56,840 the land force, 2200 the navy, 7900 the air force, and 210,000 people in reserve. The armed forces of Armenia, according to various estimates, comprise 50 to 70 thousand people, with another 210,000 people in reserve. Such are the quantitative indicators. However, it is not about the army or even the equipment. Much more important is the moral component, which is known to often break the course of military operations. A simple example is the national liberation war in Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended in victory of the people of Artsakh, despite the numerical superiority of Azerbaijan in manpower and equipment. Back in 1992, even the mujahideen mercenaries proved unable to save the Azerbaijani army.

In case of the most pessimistic forecast, the South Caucasus states will ""return"" into the empires – Ottoman, Persian or Russian. But this is an extreme case. Georgia has already started to drift to NATO, wittingly or unwittingly contributing to the revival of the Ottoman Empire within the borders of pre-World War I. Azerbaijan will be divided between Iran and Russia. As for Armenia, it is not clear what would be with it: too many countries are wishing to use the territory of the Armenian Republic for transit of energy resources, especially in light of the fact that the U.S. and Europe need new pipelines to carry energy from the Caspian Sea.

Meanwhile, according to public sources, the energy resources of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan) have inflated in recent years. In the 90s the U.S. estimated the Caspian Sea reserves to be 100-150 billion barrels. Now they are estimated to be less than half or even 50 billion. Proven oil reserves of the Caspian Sea range from 16 to 22 billion, which is comparable with the reserves of the United States (22 billion) and the North Sea (17 billion), and is 10-15 times less than all the reserves of the Middle East. Proven gas reserves of the Caspian Sea are 236-337 trillion cubic feet, comparable to U.S. reserves - 300. Turkmenistan ranks 11th in the world, with estimated 159 trillion cubic feet gas, Uzbekistan - 110, Kazakhstan - 88, Azerbaijan - 35. But even these supplies must be transported through a quiet region, in order to prevent terrorist attacks. Moreover, the pipeline should be as short as possible to reduce costs. An example of a costly and unnecessary pipeline is the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, which only confirms that politics does not always contribute to economy; everything is just the other way round.

In the twentieth century wars were fought for energy resources, and in our case there can’t be excluded local collisions for pipe. The region is too unstable, if we take into account not only the situation in connection with Iran's nuclear program, which can be as real as the weapon of mass destruction of Saddam Hussein that was never found, and there is no guarantee that it will ever be proved that Iran has a nuclear bomb. Far too dangerous is the presence of nuclear weapons in Pakistan and Israel. There is also Afghanistan torn by civil war. Not to mention the number of weapons that are available in the region. But all the above is not to say that a war is inevitable. The UN, U.S. and even the West in general had better not arm insurgents and adopt dangerous resolutions, but leave the Middle East and Central Asia in peace, instead. The world community, calling for peace (although yet in words only), will only benefit from this.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

But the alleged leak of the National Security Agency document by one of the tens of thousands of private contractors to U.S. spy agencies, barely one month after the report was written, became the newest embarrassment for the U.S. intelligence community.
Keen to crack down on a flood of leaks, almost immediately after the report was published, the Trump administration announced the arrest of intelligence contractor Reality Leigh Winner, 25, on charges of violating the espionage act.
""Releasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation's security and undermines public faith in government. People who are trusted with classified information and pledge to protect it must be held accountable when they violate that obligation,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement.
The NSA report was published Monday by The Intercept, an online news website which focuses on national security issues. It depicted a hacking operation tied closely to Moscow's GRU intelligence directorate that targeted private U.S. companies providing voter registration services and equipment to local governments.
The operation, which potentially threatened the integrity of the U.S. vote, went on for months, until just days before the November 8 election, according to the document.
The NSA did not conclude whether the hackers had any effect on the outcome, The Intercept said. But U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly said vote tallies were not affected in the election, in which President Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in a shock upset.
The Intercept said the NSA document was dated May 5, and did not say how they acquired it. But barely an hour after its report appeared, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Winner, an employee of a national security contractor in Augusta, Georgia, for leaking top secret information to ""an online news outlet"".
While neither the information leaked or the outlet were identified in the arrest documents, the information was also described as a report dated May 5. Intelligence officials have confirmed to U.S. media that Winner's case was linked to The Intercept.

“Karabakh has never resorted to similar actions,” he said.

The blast appeared to be the latest in an escalating campaign of gun and bomb attacks by militants on ethnic Hazaras in Quetta because they belong to Pakistan's Shi'ite minority.

Mir Zubair, Quetta's police chief, said a suicide bomber riding a bicycle had detonated his explosives when he was stopped at a barrier in the Hazara Town district, a Hazara enclave on the western edge of the city.

""The dead included nine women, a girl and a 14-year-old boy,"" Zubair told reporters.

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a militant group which has carried out many gun and bomb attacks on Hazaras in Quetta, said it was behind the bombing. A spokesman for the group called the Express News television channel to make the claim.

The group is aligned with the Takfiri Deobandi school of Islam, which sees Shi'ites as infidels.

Lashkar has intensified its campaign in Quetta this year.

They will hand the information and IP addresses of these people over to her while other cases like this continue around the world.,"When Nicola Brookes posted a message of support on Facebook about her favorite contestant on The X Factor talent competition, she found herself the victim of incessant and constant torment from anonymous cyberbullies. But rather than take the abuse sitting down, Brookes decided to fight, taking her assailants to court. And she won.

In her suit, Brookes claimed to have been the victim of a number of slanderous, malicious attacks. Her attackers created a page on the social network that branded the Brighton, U.K. woman as a drug dealer and a pedophile. The court ruled that Facebook must turn over the names, email addresses, and IP information of the trolls who tormented her.

For its part, Facebook is not expected to fight the court order. The company will comply as soon as it is officially served papers by the court, explaining in a statement that, ""we respect our legal obligations and work with law enforcement to ensure that such people are brought to justice.""

Brooks, who filed the suit after having trouble getting the police to take her problems seriously, appears to be satisfied with the court's ruling. ""I want them exposed,"" said Brookes. ""They exposed me and they invaded my life. I didn't ask for it. They wanted a reaction from me and now they have got it.""

It is produced by Jason Reitman.","A trailer for Jason Reitman‘s next film, “Men, Women & Children”, hit the web, TheWrap said.

The “Juno” and “Up in the Air” director is coming off the bummer bust of his adaptation of the book “Labor Day,” which mixed crime and melancholy into a period piece starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet, who played a woman entirely disconnected from the world. This time around, Reitman presents a more contemporary setting, with cell phones and technology causing so much interconnection that people are miserable all over again.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Adam Sandler likes hookers, his wife Rosemarie DeWitt likes at least one other man, “Short Term 12” star Kaitlyn Dever feels left out, Jennifer Garner is mopey, “Fault in Our Stars” breakout Ansel Elgort isn't sure how to text, and all in all, it's tough living in the suburbs.

Below is the synopsis of the film, which is adapted from a book written by Chad Kultgen and debuts at the Toronto Film Festival:

“Men, Women & Children” follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose – some tragic, some hopeful – as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.

Lavrov continues to believe Russia helps them and he along with the Russians argue the EU is partially to cause the instability.,"The profound and pervasive crisis in Ukraine is a matter of grave concern for Russia, the country’s Foreign Minister said in a piece published by the Guardian.

“We understand perfectly well the position of a country which became independent just over 20 years ago and still faces complex tasks in constructing a sovereign state. Among them is the search for a balance of interests among its various regions, the peoples of which have different historical and cultural roots, speak different languages and have different perspectives on their past and present, and their country's future place in the world,” Lavrov said.

“Given these circumstances, the role of external forces should have been to help Ukrainians protect the foundations of civil peace and sustainable development, which are still fragile. Russia has done more than any other country to support the independent Ukrainian state, including for many years subsidizing its economy through low energy prices. Last November, at the outset of the current crisis, we supported Kiev's wish for urgent consultations between Ukraine, Russia and the EU to discuss harmonizing the integration process. Brussels flatly rejected it. This stand reflected the unproductive and dangerous line the EU and U.S. have been taking for a long time. They have been trying to compel Ukraine to make a painful choice between east and west, further aggravating internal differences,” he said.

Ukraine's realities notwithstanding, massive support was provided to political movements promoting western influence, and it was done in direct breach of the Ukrainian constitution. This is what happened in 2004, when President Viktor Yushchenko won an unconstitutional third round of elections introduced under EU pressure. This time round, power in Kiev was seized undemocratically, through violent street protests conducted with the direct participation of ministers and other officials from the U.S. and EU countries, according to the Russian minister.

“Assertions that Russia has undermined efforts to strengthen partnerships on the European continent do not correspond to the facts. On the contrary, our country has steadily promoted a system of equal and indivisible security in the Euro-Atlantic area. We proposed signing a treaty to that effect, and advocated the creation of a common economic and human space from the Atlantic to the Pacific which would also be open to post-Soviet countries,” he said.

“In the meantime, western states, despite their repeated assurances to the contrary, have carried out successive waves of NATO enlargement, moved the alliance's military infrastructure eastward and begun to implement antimissile defense plans. The EU's Eastern Partnership program is designed to bind the so-called focus states tightly to itself, shutting down the possibility of co-operation with Russia. Attempts by those who staged the secession of Kosovo from Serbia and of Mayotte from the Comoros to question the free will of Crimeans cannot be viewed as anything but a flagrant display of double standards. No less troubling is the pretence of not noticing that the main danger for the future of Ukraine is the spread of chaos by extremists and neo-Nazis,” Lavrov said.

“Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilization in Ukraine. We are firmly convinced that this can be achieved through, among other steps: real constitutional reform, which would ensure the legitimate rights of all Ukrainian regions and respond to demands from its south-eastern region to make Russian the state's second official language; firm guarantees on Ukraine's non-aligned status to be enshrined in its laws, thus ensuring its role as a connecting link in an indivisible European security architecture; and urgent measures to halt activity by illegal armed formations of the Right Sector and other ultra-nationalist groups,” he said.

“We are not imposing anything on anyone, we just see that if it is not done, Ukraine will continue to spiral into crisis with unpredictable consequences. We stand ready to join international efforts aimed at achieving these goals. We support the appeal by foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland to implement the February 21 agreement. Their proposal – to hold Russia-EU talks with the participation of Ukraine and other Eastern Partnership states about the consequences of EU association agreements – corresponds to our position. The world of today is not a junior school where teachers assign punishments at will. Belligerent statements such as those heard at the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on April 1 do not match demands for a de-escalation. De-escalation should begin with rhetoric.

In the book, Balakian writes about learning what his family and ancestors experienced with the Turkish government's extermination of more than 1 million Armenians in 1915, including many of his relatives.

The 55th edition of Critics’ Week will kick off on May 12 with Justine Triet’s “In Bed With Victoria,” a light-hearted, frank and contemporary comedy about a young single mother (played by Virginie Efira) trying to find the balance between her career and her love life. According to Critics’ Week artistic director Charles Tesson, this sophomore offering from the Cesar-nominated director of “Age of Panic” (which opened in the ACID section in 2013) underscores a willingness to shake up the sidebar and marks a change in tone from the typically serious-minded movies that constitute the rest of the section.

The Critics’ Week selection committee sifted through 1,100 feature-length submissions in order to come up with the final 10, which include six feature debuts and four sophomore outings.

Addressing the absence of features from the American continent at Critics’ Week (after last year’s four entries), Tesson explained his disappointment with trends he saw at this year’s Sundance. “After launching films such as ‘Take Shelter’ and ‘It Follows,’ it’s possible that we’ve raised the bar too high for American movies, and we were more inspired by movies coming from France, Southern Europe, Asia and the Middle-East that allow us to explore uncharted territories,” said Tesson.

The selection entails various films that touch on current issues in a cinematic and original way, for instance Mehmet Can Mertoglu’s “Album,” about deep-rooted prejudice in Turkey, Vatche Boulghourjian’s “Tramontane” about a blind man on the trail of his origins in post-war Lebanon, and Kesavada Rajagopal’s “Yellow Bird,” an unusual portrait of Singapore torn by conflicts between Chinese and Indian communities.

Tesson said the French directors of this year’s lineup, notably Julia Ducournau with “Raw,” Jean-Christophe Meurisse with “Apnee” and Justine Triet with “In Bed with Victoria” are bold and innovative in their own ways. “Apnee,” for instance, is an omnibus feature laced with surreal, ferocious humor looking at today’s French society.

Closing night will consist of three short films from actresses making their directorial debuts: Sandrine Kiberlain’s “Smile,” Laetitia Casta’s “En moi” and Chloe Sevigny’s “Kitty” — the latter being the lone American to be found in a lineup that is framed by female talent.

Tesson said “all three shorts work well together as if they dialogued with each other,” sharing the themes of acting, womanhood and transformation.

The competition boasts just one other distaff-directed feature, the cannibalism-themed “Raw” from French helmer Julia Ducournau, who won a Critics’ Week prize for her short “Junior” in 2011. Her latest centers on a 16-year-old (Garance Marillier) who makes a radical break from her family’s vegetarian ways after sampling flesh during her first day at veterinary school.

A symbol of its 50+5 edition, Critics’ Week will play the shorts of two filmmakers who were discovered at the Cannes sidebar: Cesar Agusto Acevedo with “Los Pasos de agua” and Nadav Lapid with “From the Diary of a Wedding Photographer.”

The 2012 report on anti-Semitism indicated that the confluence of extreme rightwing political movements and Islamic radicalism have been responsible for a new wave of anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe.

Based on data collected by the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at Tel Aviv University, Edelstein noted that “the main conclusion emerging from the document... is that compared to 2011, there was an escalation in violent incidents against Jews around the world.”

While the claimed surge in anti-Semitic incidents is connected to incitement against Israel, the report admitted, it also claimed that there was no direct correlation between any specific actions or policies taken by the State of Israel and the rising violence.

The worst increase in anti- Semitism was seen in Western Europe, according to the report, which listed a number of incidents in France and Germany, including the bombing of a grocery store in Sarcelles, France and the shooting deaths of four Jews at the Otsar HaTorah religious school in Toulouse.

Many synagogues in France are now surrounded by high concrete walls and receive special police security details on major holidays. It is also common for Jews in many French cities to remove their kippot for safety reasons when walking outside.

The report said France was the leading country for anti-Semitic incidents with 114 reported in 2011, followed closely by the UK with 105. Canada and Australia reported 68 and 30, respectively.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

The pay cable network has optioned the book, published last fall, for the comedy project, which will be produced by Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Prods. under the company’s deal at HBO. Kramer will write the script and executive produce.

These Things Happen is set in present day Manhattan and focuses on two couples – one gay, one straight. They share a 15-year-old son, who lives on the upper East Side with his mother and doctor stepfather. Trying to get to know his impressive, distant father better, he moves in for a semester with him and his long-time partner who forms an instant friendship with the boy.

“What’s it like to be a 15-year-old boy living in New York City and have your best friend come out as gay? In These Things Happen, award-winning television writer, director, and producer and first-time novelist Richard Kramer has provided a smart, funny, and insightful exploration. Wesley and his oldest and closest friend Theo are growing up and attending private school in the city. Their days are filled with college coaches (you need an edge to get into Brown), soccer practice, homework, and hormones. Wesley is currently living with his father, a well-known and respected gay activist, and his father’s boyfriend George, a former theater actor and co-owner of the restaurant above which they live. (“I’m not a very queenie queen,” declares George.)

Tenth grade appears to be going swimmingly, and Theo has just won the race for class president. Theo surprises everyone, including himself, when he announces, at the end of his acceptance speech, that he is gay and sets the true motion of the novel rolling. As Wesley tries to deal with this new reality and figure out how to have a relationship with important and unavailable father, everyone else in his life has to evaluate what Theo’s revelation means. When an act of violence turns up the emotional volume, the results are often not pretty, even for these educated, well-meaning people.

Although the first pages might give the impression of a light story and a quick read, These Things Happen is neither. We experience the action from the point of view of each main character in their distinctive and often charming voices as they stumble their way through a difficult situation and find their way back towards each other. They are a very introspective bunch, which sometimes hindered the story for me and made reading more difficult.

“Memoria” is the second film in Monterey’s release lineup produced by the Art of Elysium and Rabbit Bandini Productions, following “Yosemite.” All of the funds from these films go to the Art of Elysium, a non-profit organization which supports and encourages bringing the arts to hospitalized youth, elders and the homeless community.

They hope the US will be a neutral mediator in Armenian Turkey relations,"Developments in the Near East can change the balance of forces in the region and influence on Armenia's relations with Turkey and Iran. The main player in the region is the U.S., which is interested in stability in the Near East and Caucasus. This power's wish to push Russia from the South Caucasus, specifically from Armenia, is also an important factor. Professor of international relations and politics of the Universidad de San Andrés in Buenos Aires, Dr Khachik Ter-Ghukassian comments to PanARMENIAN.Net on the ongoing events in the region and their possible impact on Armenia.
The international community attaches big importance to the events taking place in the Neat East. How do you assess the current situation?

The Near East is of great interest for Washington. It specifically refers to the Caucasus. The U.S. is perfectly aware that war with Iran will redouble instability in the region while Washington needs ""an arc of stability"" from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. First of all, it concerns oil. The U.S. stands for cooperation but the situation is tensed, if not explosive. Although, Washington has intentions to improve relations with Iran. 

However, certain difficulties may cause internal developments in the Caucasus. It's quite possible that the map of the Near East may change. Anyway, there are some preconditions for it. The U.S. plans a ""mild"" division of Iraq with further formation of independent Kurdistan. At the same time I should stress that U.S. presence in Iraq doesn't alleviate tension. Unfortunately, the Arab world lacks either political or intellectual force capable to change the situation.

Normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations becomes more urgent for the United States. Can Washington have its will?

At the moment Turkey's foreign policy is targeted at Northern Iraq and improvement of relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan, what includes development of communications and military-strategic partnership. If Turkey's succeeds in realizing its plans Armenia will be isolated from the world. Curiously enough, such state of things is not convenient for the U.S. which insists on opening of the Armenian-Turkish border. However, normalization of relations without preconditions is a dangerous tendency. Turkey doesn't open the border proceeding from political reasons: the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the Armenian Genocide and absence of fixed border with Armenia. The only legal basis for demarcation of borders is the Sevr Treaty. No agreement signed after Sevr, namely the Kars and Moscow treaties, do not have juridical effect, since the signatory powers stopped their existence as elements of international law. The Sevr Treaty was signed August 10, 1920. Borders with independent Armenia had to be marked by a neutral mediator, namely the United States, according to it. 

At that we should not forget that Turkey has always been the biggest danger for the Armenian people. This opinion should be shared by the whole nation, both in Armenia and Diaspora. On the other hand, opening of borders can tell on Armenia's economy. Georgia, where the local industry was destroyed because of the abundant flow of cheap Turkish goods, can serve as an example. Certainly, Armenian economy can't compete with the Turkish, but we will have an outlet to the world, at least. Although, we are not ready to make a reality of the scenario we will be offered.

Iran and Armenia enjoy lasting and friendly ties. How would you comment on them?

If the United States collides with Turkey over Northern Iraq and simultaneously improves relations with Iran, it will be the best scenario for Armenia. Actually, under circumstances Russia's presence as a security guarantor for Armenia will lose urgency. We should strengthen relations with Iran. 

Iran is a minority in the Islamic world, since it practices Shi'ism. This state is the potential regional power. Will Washington have a political force to hold a dialogue with Iran as equals? This is the core of the problem. How the balance will be maintained between the Sunnis (al Qaeda) and Shiites? How the Lebanese problem will be resolved. These are questions that need exact answers. Under any circumstances, the Armenia-Iran relations should be apart any shocks in the region.

220 members of the House of Representatives have supported the Armenian Genocide Resolution. Do you think it will be put on vote?

The U.S. government will use the H.Res.106 as the main took of pressure on Turkey. Struggle between Democrats and Republicans as well as the presidential elections in the United States may speed up or, on the contrary, protract the decision. If Washington is really interested in normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations it will press on Turkey with this Resolution. As to the opinion, that passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution is necessary for the Armenian community of the U.S., I am convinced that opposing Armenia and Diaspora in the Genocide issue is dangerous and immoral.

Argentina is among the states that recognized the Armenian Genocide. How efficient are the activities of the Armenian community of Argentina?

Argentina is the second, after France, state where the Armenian Genocide is recognized on the legislative level. The history of the Genocide is a compulsory subject in schools of Buenos Aires. The Hay Dat Argentinean Office has organized a special textbook. It also holds seminars for school teachers.

I would like to note that Venezuela, which is far enough from the major states of South America, has also recognized the Armenian Genocide. In the 1980-ies Armenians of Argentina and other South American states started integration into in the society. We have become a part of the countries, which gave us shelter. We should proceed on this way basing on the example of the Armenian community of France. 

I should also mention that the first sitting of the South American Parliament will take place July 21. Three states - Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay - have agreed on forming the structure with the capital in Montevideo. Our work will become more coordinated",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/details/224275/,The story of Judo,28-Oct-16,World,N/A,Today is world Judo day. It looks at how Jigoro Kano creates Juro.,"The World Judo Day is the birthday of Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo. Today, more than 20 million people practice judo around the world on a daily basis. The IJF has 200 national member federations and five continental unions.

The takenouchi-ryu martial art system founded in 1532 is considered the beginning of Japan’s Jujitsu forms. Judo was derived from Jujitsu, the art for either attacking others or defending oneself with nothing but one’s own body.

In 1882, Jigoro Kano made a comprehensive study of the ancient self-defense forms and integrated the best of these forms into a sport which is known as Kodokan Judo. The term Kodokan breaks down into ko (lecture, study, method), do (way or path), and kan (hall or place). Thus it means “a place to study the way”. Similarly judo breaks down into ju (gentle) and do (way or path) or “the gentle way”.



Jigoro Kano was born in 1860 to a sake-brewing family in the town of Mikage, Japan. However, Kano's father was an adopted son and he did not go into the family business. Instead, he worked as a lay priest and as a senior clerk for a shipping line. Kano's father was a great believer in the power of education, and he provided Jigoro, his third son, with an excellent education. Kano's mother died when the boy was nine years old, and his father moved the family to Tokyo. The young Kano was enrolled in private schools, and had his own English language tutor. In 1874 he was sent to a private school run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills.

Standing 1,57m but weighing only 41kg, the youth was the object of daily tyranny and bullying by older and stronger boys. Tired of classmates’ mockery, he strived for physical strength. It was then that he became interested in jujutsu, a martial art he once had heard about.

In 1875, Kano's first attempt to be admitted for jujutsu training was rejected. After learning that many former jujutsu practitioners became osteopaths to earn a living, Kano found a clinic run by Sadanosuke Yagi, who really practiced jujutsu in the past. However, the youth’s request for instruction was refused. Yagi, in turn, referred him to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu was itself a combination of two older schools: the Yoshin-ryu and Shin no Shindo-ryu.

Fukuda's training method consisted mostly of the student taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the mechanics of the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.



Kano had trouble defeating Fukushima Kanekichi, who was one of his seniors at the school. Therefore, Kano started trying unfamiliar techniques on his rival. He first tried techniques from sumo. When these did not help, he studied more, and tried a technique (""fireman's carry"") that he learned from a book on western wrestling. This moment gave a start to his career.

At the age of 22, Kano became an instructor and opened a dojo of his own in rented premises. Using the money he earned, he prepared a 12-mat dojo which he called the ""Kodokan"". He also changed his school from ""jujutsu"" to ""Judo"". While gathering students and teaching Judo, he also began to incorporate the principles of body, mind, and character development into his Judo philosophy.



The categorization of Kodokan Judo was completed about 1887. The Kodokan had three broad aims: physical education, contest proficiency and mental training.

Proceeding with the organization of the Kodokan and enacting the regulations of Judo, Prof. Kano became the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee in 1909 and worked for the spread of Judo world-wide. Judo became an official event in the Olympic Games of Tokyo in 1964, backed by Judo fans and sport promoters all over the world.

Jigoro Kano attained a doctorate degree in Judo, a degree equivalent to the twelfth dan, awarded to the originator of Judo only. He constantly worked to ensure the development of athletics and Japanese sport in general, and as a result is often called the ”Father of Japanese Sports”. In 1935, he was awarded the Asahi prize for his outstanding contribution to the organizing of sport in Japan during his lifetime.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

A visit by company representatives turned into a surprise for the 52-year-old homeowner Hayk Baghdasaryan and his family.

The foundation of the Bagdasaryans’ house was laid 20 years ago when they were full of hope that finishing construction is not a major problem. The homeowner has been able to build only the walls and a concrete ceiling so far.

Throughout two decades, Hayk’s family - his wife and the three adult sons - had to live at Hayk’s paternal house, then rented the neighbor’s half-damaged house. The elder son, Argishti, now serves in the army in Martakert, while the two sons go to school.

The organization monitors society to help prevent human rights abuses and corruption as the states separate.,"The European Union has approved a civilian police and justice mission to help enforce the rule of law in Kosovo, which is poised to declare independence from Serbia. The 2,000-strong mission will begin deploying to the region from next week. 

 The U.S. and most EU states are preparing to recognize Kosovo quickly, but Serbia and Russia strongly oppose the move, which is widely expected on Sunday. 
 
 Earlier, Kosovo's PM sought to reassure the province's Serbian minority that it would not face discrimination. 
 
 Speaking to reporters in Kosovo's capital Pristina, Hashim Thaci pledged that the rights of all communities, including Serbs, would be guaranteed. He said no citizen of an independent Kosovo should feel discriminated against. ""In Kosovo, there will be security for all citizens. The government is committed to looking forward to the future and overcoming the sad past."" 
 
 The EU waited diplomatically until Serbia's pro-Western President Boris Tadic was sworn into office on Friday before giving the final green light for the deployment of the mission.
 
 The decision was formalized by a so-called ""silent procedure"", under which members of the 27-nation bloc had until midnight on Friday to voice objections. 
 
 The 2,000 EU police and customs officers, judges and prosecutors are tasked with helping to prevent human rights abuses and ensure that Kosovo's fragile institutions are free from political interference. 
 
 Crucially, the mission will be able to intervene in sensitive areas such as fighting corruption and organized crime and catching war crime suspects. 
 
 
 
 While Germany and Italy are the biggest contributors, all EU members except for tiny Malta will take part, as well as non-EU countries like the United States, Turkey and Croatia.

 ""I want to announce the results after the full count and to inform the Montenegrin public that I achieved a winning result with 51.3 percent of votes to 49.7 percent,"" Vujanovic said.

 Lekic compared his rival's claim to a ""coup d'etat.""
 
 Lekic's Democratic Front said it would contest the election, claiming fraud by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, (DPS).
 
 The head of the state election commission, Ivan Kalezic, dismissed the allegations by Lekic and his party. However, the election commission has made no announcement of a winner, nor made clear when it would do so. That despite the fact only some 500,000 people were eligible to vote.

 ""The press is so free in Turkey that one can insult, slander, defame, make racist statements and commit hate crimes that are not tolerated even in democratic countries.""

 Turkey was the world’s top jailer of journalists in 2012 and 2013, ahead of Iran and China, according to the international Committee to Protect Journalists, before improving to tenth place this year.
 
 Erdogan’s comments came less than two weeks after police raids on opposition media allegedly linked to Erdogan’s arch-foe Fethullah Gulen prompted a furious reaction from the European Union.
 
 Erdogan has blamed Gulen for concocting stunning corruption allegations that emerged last year concerning ministers and his own inner circle that also touched his own son Bilal.
 
 The remarks also coincided with the release pending trial of a 16-year-old schoolboy who was controversially arrested on charges of insulting Erdogan by accusing him of being the ""chief of corruption.""
 
 But Erdogan said: ""You cannot insult them (his family) like this in any other country. There is no limit to the insults (we receive). You cannot run such headlines in Europe or the U.S.""
 
 ""Europeans accuse us as if such things never happen in their countries. No one raises their voice when journalists are detained in Europe.""
 
 He launched another bitter attack on the European Union, the latest episode in a bitter row that erupted with the EU’s criticism of the raids on opposition media.

Mr Basescu faces allegations of encroaching on the prime minister's role and violating citizens' rights, BBC News reported.
 
 If parliament approves the move, he will face suspension and a national poll on his impeachment.
 
 The president is in conflict with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who heads the Social Liberal Union (USL), which has a majority in parliament.
 
 The European Commission voiced concern about the political turmoil on Friday, July 6. Romania joined the EU in 2007 but Brussels has demanded more reforms to stamp out official corruption.
 
 Mr Ponta, who came to power in May, says Mr Basescu has too much influence over Romania's Constitutional Court, which is due to consider new impeachment legislation.
 
 The leftist USL party asked parliament to hold an extraordinary meeting to suspend Mr Basescu.
 
 Mr Ponta himself is currently under pressure to resign over allegations of plagiarism regarding a doctoral thesis he wrote.
 
 President Basescu has accused him of trying to impeach him as a way of taking control of state institutions.
 
 The president has suffered a slump in his popularity since pushing through tough austerity measures demanded by international lenders in 2010.
 
 The political rivalry has stalled decision-making processes in Romania at a time when it is finalising agreements on an IMF-backed aid package for its economy.
 
 The European Commission says it is ""concerned about current developments in Romania, especially regarding actions that appear to reduce the effective powers of independent institutions like the Constitutional Court"".
 
 ""The rule of law, the democratic checks and balances and the independence of the judiciary are cornerstones of European democracy... Government policy and political action must respect these principles and values.""
 
 The statement said recent developments in Romania ""may be putting at risk the progress made over the years"".

 The report expressed concern that two controversial laws passed in Parliament in the aftermath of the corruption investigation, which erupted with a wave of detentions on Dec. 17, “are taking Turkey away from its path towards the fulfillment of the Copenhagen criteria.”
 
 The new laws, one on the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the other on the regulation of the Internet, have also faced severe criticism at home, with detractors arguing the laws are meant to expand government control over judicial appointments and Internet content at the expense of freedoms and the principle of separation of powers.
 
 The report, written by Dutch Christian Democrat parliamentarian Ria Oomen-Ruijten, and several amendments to the report were approved with 475 votes for to 153 against, with 43 abstentions, in Strasbourg.
 
 Six of the 24 proposed amendments were approved in Wednesday's vote.
 
 ""Turkey has embarked on reform for the benefit of its own citizens. Recent developments in the area of fundamental freedoms, independence of the judiciary, freedom of expression and others are however a cause of grave concern for us. We now need a serious, constructive dialogue with Turkey on these subjects and Turkey needs to show true commitment to its European aspirations and to the values upon which the EU is founded,"" said Turkey rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten, according to an EP press release issued on Wednesday.
 
 Speaking during debate before the resolution's approval on Tuesday in Strasbourg, European Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighborhood Policy Stefan Füle said the Turkish government's way of handling the corruption probe is a serious cause for concern.
 
 “Unfortunately, as I said, there have also been reasons for serious concern. They relate first and foremost to the government's response to the recent corruption allegations, in particular the adoption of legislation which affects the functioning of the judiciary and freedom of expression,” Füle said, according to Today's Zaman.
 
 The EP report expresses concerns “at the recent developments in Turkey with regard to allegations of high-level corruption; regrets the removal of the prosecutors and police officers in charge of the original investigations, as this goes against the fundamental principle of an independent judiciary and deeply affects the prospects of credible investigations; considers regrettable the serious breakdown of trust between the government, the judiciary, the police, and the media; urges the Government of Turkey, therefore, to show full commitment to democratic principles and refrain from any further interference in the investigation and prosecution of corruption.”
 
 The resolution on the report says the Internet law “introduces excessive controls on, and monitoring of, internet access and has the potential to significantly impact on free expression, investigative journalism, democratic scrutiny and access to politically diverse information over the internet” and calls on Turkey to revise the law in line with European standards on media freedoms and freedom of expression.
 
 The resolution also criticizes Turkey for “excessive violence” by the police against protesters in last summer's Gezi Park protests.

 UEFA's determination to protect football from the scourge of match-fixing and to punish those found guilty has been emphasized at the European governing body's inaugural regional Integrity Officers seminar in Skopje.
 
 According to UEFA official website, integrity officers from the national associations of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia joined with UEFA in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's capital to look at the progress of the campaign against match-fixing, examine work being done in the various countries and consider strategies to pursue these efforts into the future.

 Transparency International looked at firms from the 10 largest arms exporting nations including the UK, U.S., Russia, Germany, France and China.
 
 The 129 firms it studied are worth more than $10tn (£6tn) and are responsible for over 90% of global arms sales.
 
 The study analyses what the biggest defense companies around the world do, or fail to do, to prevent corruption.
 
 Transparency International rates them both on the amount of information publicly available about how they tackle corruption, but also - for the 34 companies who submitted answers - on their internal ethics and compliance methods.
 
 The companies - with a combined revenue of more than £300bn - are graded from A to F, with A representing the most extensive evidence of firms' anti-corruption systems.
 
 Only one firm, the American Fluor Corporation, gets an A overall, while the British defence giant, BAE Systems, rates a B in both categories.
 
 he European aerospace company EADS rates a C for the information it makes public on its anti-corruption practices, while British firms Serco group and Qinetiq each get a B in that category. French company Dassault aviation rates a D, for limited information, while 47 companies from countries ranging from China and Russia to Pakistan rate an F, for putting up little or no evidence of the anti-corruption systems they may have in place.
 
 The Transparency International Defense Companies anti-corruption index 2012 finds that 85% of defense industry leaders are not speaking up enough about the importance of ethics and preventing corruption.
 
 It also says that only 10% of companies have good disclosure of what they do to stop it, although Transparency says that's better than a decade ago.

Egyptian officials have accused the UK of hiding stolen wealth and breaching international anti-corruption accords.,"The UK government is failing in its commitment to freeze assets of the regime of former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, a BBC investigation has found.
 
 Publicly available documents reveal property and companies linked to key figures in the Mubarak circle that have been unaffected by sanctions.
 
 Egyptian officials accuse the UK of hiding stolen wealth and breaching international anti-corruption accords. The UK says it is doing as much as it can to trace the funds.
 
 Reports that President Hosni Mubarak and his inner circle stole tens of billions of dollars helped fuel the revolution which overthrew him on February 11 last year.
 
 Three days later, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague told parliament the UK would co-operate with an Egyptian government request to freeze the assets of several former officials. But it was a further 37 days before Britain and other EU states applied the sanctions - a period when Egypt says the accused officials were able to move their money elsewhere.
 
 About £85m ($135m) of assets belonging to Mubarak, his wife, two sons, and 15 other Egyptians have now been frozen in the UK. But the BBC says its investigation found assets that have apparently been missed.
 
 The publicly accessible Companies House register reveals that one of those named on the sanctions list, Naglaa al-Ghazaerly, wife of the former housing minister, was able to register a company in her own name in London in November 2011, seven months after her assets were ordered to be frozen.
 
 Another similar document shows that a London investment company, Medinvest Associates, co-founded by Mubarak's younger son Gamal, and still belonging to a Cypriot firm he helped run, continued operating until it dissolved itself, voluntarily, in February this year - 11 months after sanctions were imposed.
 
 Meanwhile there is no indication on Land Registry documents of any freeze on the large house worth between £8m and £10m in Wilton Place, off Knightsbridge in London, that was Gamal Mubarak's UK home for many years until the Egyptian revolution.
 
 He listed the house as his address as recently as 2010, when it appears on the birth certificate of his daughter Farida.
 
 The house is registered to a company in the tax haven of Panama. But in international practice, sanctions should apply to any assets of which the named individual is the ""beneficial owner"" - the person who enjoys the benefit of them, even if the title is in another name.
 
 Britain has accepted official requests from Egypt for legal assistance to help trace and freeze assets. But Egypt says the UK is asking for more information before it can proceed further - information Egypt says it does not have.
 
 The Foreign Office says it has passed all information received from the BBC to relevant authorities, but cannot comment further on individual cases.

Azerbaijan has not receieved positive publicity though all the publications referred to pursue the same goal, that Ilham Aliyev change the situation in the country, hold normal elections and cause few problems, yet he still falls to the same road of violence and corruption","Or it will – depending on what decision the senators will make. And it’s not about the Armenian lobby, to which Azerbaijani media often refers, but it’s about the diplomat himself, who, according to an observer of The Washington Post, Fred Hiatt, put the “special” interests above national ones. Though Hiatt writes that the Department of State recalls Bryza, who has “served with distinction”, the article says nothing about the role of Bryza in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement, although it was his behavior in this area that led to blocking his appointment. Bryza had to face the practical classic cumulative effect: one shouldn’t speak so sharply and unequivocally against the two national problems of the Armenian nation - Genocide and Artsakh - and then wonder why such a brilliant career has to be ruined.
 
 Just a couple of days later The New York Times published the article “Frozen in Time” by Frank Jacobs about Cyprus and Karabakh conflicts. We’ll still revert to Jacobs, but the column in The Washington Post generates certain thoughts. Not once in the current year did in WikiLeaks appear shorthand records from Baku, which did not add pluses to the Aliyev regime. Dispersal of demonstrators and detentions of opposition members is unlikely to help Aliyev remain a “democrat” in the eyes of his American friends. There is one more circumstance to be taken into account: the U.S. considered the situation and realized that in the event she invades Iran, Baku cannot be relied on, and therefore she should deal shortly with Aliyev. Moreover, the U.S. has a reliable ally in the person of Mikhail Saakashvili, who will provide Georgian airfields for the U.S. Air Force bases. According to Hiatt, and it is very important, no U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan will be perceived as a neutral person and he will be given to understand that he is the representative of interests of the Armenian lobby, regardless of what the ambassador really thinks of the Karabakh conflict and the Armenian Genocide.
 
 As for the article in the blog of Frank Jacobs in The New York Times, it quite clearly defines the Cyprus and Karabakh conflicts. In the part devoted to the Karabakh conflict, Jacobs believes that the conflict has a time frame:1988-1994. Proceeding from this logic, what happened afterwards and is happening between Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan now is nothing but an attempt of Baku to receive compensation for the lost war. The journalist calls the NKR a de facto republic. In fact, it is the first time Karabakh has been called this way in the American press. The article, among other things, contains one interesting point: Jacobs suggests that the international community recognize Cyprus and Nagorno-Karabakh as political reality of the XXI century. A controversial suggestion, indeed. Hardly will Turkey and Azerbaijan agree to such recognition, but the mere fact that it has been voiced, gives us some hope.
 
 All of these publications to be followed by others pursue one and the same goal - to make Ilham Aliyev change the situation in the country, hold normal elections and little shake his fists. The region and the U.S. would prefer that he behaved more appropriately. But, most likely, Aliyev piously believes that he did everything rightfully and so continues walking the same road of violence and corruption. Obviously, Baku drew no lesson from the sad example of the Arab regimes, but she’d better do so. Ilham Aliyev is different from Gaddafi or Mubarak only in that he was made a head of state by his father. He did not have to win the power and here lies his weakness, which is used by all those who want to overthrow him. Washington knows it better than anyone and following her stick and carrot policy, she has so far been manipulating Azerbaijan. But if and when it comes to sticking, neither oil or gas, nor the millions will save Aliyev. Millions, by the way, have saved no one so far.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/politics/details/42717/,Democracy in Azerbaijan surrenders oil pressure,10/16/08,Azerbaijan,N/A,The Azerbaijani economy almost fully depends on crude oil but the distribution of oil resources and any kind of democratic reforms are unfeasible in Azerbaijan currently. There are many cases of suggested law violation during the voting process of the Presidential Elections.,"For absence of necessity let us leave out the reports and assessments of international observers on «fair and democratic elections in stable Azerbaijan». In fact, the international community recognized the domination of oil over democracy, putting as a foundation-stone, as usual, the right of the strongest and the richest. In the held elections the six opponents of Aliyev were just an accompaniment necessary for the normal course of elections. At the time of the Presidential Elections of Armenia our country could offer nothing of this sort; that was why the elections had the results they had. However, this is not what we are going to discuss. The only problem of the Azerbaijani authorities was the delivery of voters to the polling stations, a task they managed successfully. There was no election rush and everything proceeded steadily, properly, and quite characteristic of Europe. However, they were especially the European observers that «did not notice» the electoral boycott imposed by opposition parties. It turns out that no opposition exists in Azerbaijan. Most probably, it is indeed so. With totalitarianism in the country, opposition is at best allowed to hold one minor piquet, after which no one can even think of opposing the authorities. 
 
 As a number of media sources inform, the Azerbaijani opposition that boycotted the elections observed serious cases of law violation during the voting process of the Presidential Elections. The Center for Cooperation of Opposition (CCO), whose representatives watched the election process in different regions of the country, has this fact mentioned in its latest statement. The Center includes the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan, the ""Musavat"" party, the Civil Development Party, the Liberal Party, and the Public Forum ""In the name of Azerbaijan"", who had all boycotted the elections.
 
 As the CCO statement says, in some of the polling stations ballot-papers were not counted at the presence of observers before the voting began. In a number of cases ballot-papers were provided without an ID card. The openings of some ballot boxes did not meet international norms, which allowed several ballots to be dropped at a time. At the polling stations of the Divichinskiy and Surakhanskiy districts the method of ""carousel"" was used, i.e. one and the same person voted several times in different polling stations. The method was actively applied after midday so that by 3:00 p.m. they would be able to report 50% of participation in the elections, the CCO observers believe. According to official data 53% of voters had taken part in the elections by 3:00 p.m. In majority of regions autobuses and taxis carried voters to polling stations under the control of executive structures. The malls ""Sharg"" and ""Bollug"" were closed and the sellers were made to go voting. A similar case could also be observed in the local fair ad in other shopping centers of Ganja. 
 
 ""At the time of Heydar Aliyev the Azerbaijani budget was about USD 1 billion against today's USD 10 billion, but all the petrodollars are now spent on satisfying the appetite of the Aliyev family and on projects that give the impression of economic development. Ten years ago TV channels regularly invited opposition representatives to interviews, whereas today they never do it. There were several serious oppositional publications ten years ago, while we have only a couple of them left today. Ten years ago attack on a journalist was considered a serious offense, while journalists are imprisoned for their articles today. Journalists have been killed, arrested and assaulted recently,"" says Ex-Speaker of Parliament Isa Gambar, who was a Presidential candidate in 2003 and, according to official data, got 12% of votes. 
 
 For the past years the number of influential economic groups has decreased, whereas corruption has gained force in Azerbaijan. In the Transparency International rating Azerbaijan has the 158th standing, falling behind of its neighbours Georgia (67th standing) and Armenia (109th standing). Every day the Azeri media ""boasts"" such headlines as ""Hanged Himself"", ""Slaughtered"", ""Committed Suicide"", not to mention hundreds of cases of trafficking and narcobusiness. 
 
 The flattered Azerbaijani economy almost fully depends on crude oil, which formed 97 per cent of national export for the first half of the current year. Distribution of oil resources is out of the question; everything sinks in the Aliyev clan. Any kind of democratic reforms are unfeasible in Azerbaijan.
 
 Be that as it may, Azerbaijan is condemned to govern the clan for another 5 years and then Then anyone else from the clan may become the President of Azerbaijan, for instance Mehriban, the wife of Ilham Aliyev or Aliyev's son Heydar II. However, all this is possible in one case only - if ten years later Azerbaijani oil resources do not expire.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,

 Sharif and his children are accused of graft in the ongoing case which has captivated Pakistan and threatened to topple the prime minister after the Panama Papers leak last year linked the family to offshore businesses.
 
 The Supreme Court issued a split ruling calling for a joint investigation team of anti-corruption officials along with the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Military Intelligence to probe the claims and issue a report within 60 days.
 
 ""A thorough investigation is required,"" Justice Asif Saeed Khosa told the court, presenting the 540-page written judgement which opens with the epigraph that launches Mario Puzo's 1969 novel ""The Godfather"": ""Behind every great fortune there is a crime"".
 
 Two of the five judges went further than the ruling, branding Sharif ""dishonest"" and saying he should be disqualified, but they were outnumbered.
 
 The court has disqualified leaders before, holding former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in contempt in 2012 for refusing to re-open corruption investigations into then president Asif Ali Zardari, resulting in his disqualification.
 
 Government supporters could be seen celebrating the judgement with sweets outside the court in Islamabad, where around 1,500 police commandos and riot forces had been deployed ahead of the highly anticipated decision.
 
 ""We will cooperate fully with the investigation, and seek to clear whatever doubts are left,"" defence minister Khawaja Asif told AFP.
 
 Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, whose Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party has spearheaded the push against Sharif, called on the prime minister to resign until the investigation is completed.
 
 ""Whatever explanations they gave inside the Supreme Court about their source of income have been exposed as lies,"" Khan told reporters in the wake of the judgement Thursday.

 Mohammad Reza Rahimi, a top aide to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was convicted by Iran’s supreme court last month and sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a 10bn rial ($300,000) fine. The court also ordered Rahimi to pay compensation equivalent to some $800,000.
 
 IRNA said police agents took Rahimi from his residence Sunday and brought him to Evin prison, north of the capital Tehran.
 
 The semiofficial Fars news agency said Rahimi was convicted of “acquiring wealth through illicit methods.”
 
 A local court had initially sentenced Rahimi to 15 years but the supreme court reduced the term to five years and three months.
 
 Rahimi, who once served as the head of an anti-corruption agency and received the medal of honour from Ahmadinejad, is the highest-ranking former Iranian government official to have been convicted and jailed in Iran’s history.
 
 Ahmadinejad had claimed he led “the cleanest government in Iran’s history” but his opponents had long accused his government of massive corruption.
 
 Ahmadinejad’s successor, moderate President Hassan Rouhani, criticised widespread corruption in the country in unusually blunt terms in December, saying that bribes once paid secretly are now being paid openly and vowed to fight the phenomenon.
 
 Iran is in the middle of a 20-year plan to decentralize and privatize its economy. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, has repeatedly warned officials against using the transition program as a chance to enrich themselves.
 
 In May last year, Iran executed billionaire businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi, convicted of being at the heart of a $2.6bn state bank scam. It was the largest fraud case since the Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",no,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,
