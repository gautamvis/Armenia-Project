These men were there to train Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrian rebels.","Three U.S. military trainers have been shot dead in an exchange of fire at an air base in Jordan, a U.S. official says, according to BBC News.
One was killed at the base and two others died later in hospital.
They were in vehicles approaching the gate of a military training centre at al-Jafr air base when they came under small-arms fire, the official added.
An earlier statement from the Jordanian military said the car they were in failed to stop at the gate and was fired upon by security forces.
""A total of three U.S. service members died today in the incident in Jordan,"" the official said.
""Initial reports were that one was killed, two injured. The two injured service members were transported to a hospital in Amman, where they died.""
The Pentagon and the White House said they would work with Jordan to determine exactly what had happened.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. personnel were part of an ""ongoing"" training mission.
""The United States is interested in getting to the bottom of what occurred,"" he said.
AFP news agency quoted a U.S. defence official as saying it was a ""green on blue"" incident, a military term for when friendly forces attack U.S. personnel.
""But we can't say for the moment if it was a deliberate"" act to kill U.S. personnel or ""some kind of misunderstanding,"" the official told the news agency.
The incident happened around midday local time (10:00 GMT).
Jordan is a close ally of the U.S. and a member of the U.S. -led coalition fighting the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in Syria and Iraq.
U.S. forces have trained a small group of Syrian rebels in Jordan as well as Iraqi and Palestinian security forces.

These civilians do not have food or any other supplies. A US led coalition is helping the assault on Mosul.,"Iraqi forces slowed their advance on Tuesday, July 4 through the last streets in Mosul controlled by Islamic State where militants and civilians are packed in densely together, a commander said, according to Reuters.
While Iraqi commanders predicted final victory in Mosul this week, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced they had begun an assault on Islamic State's Syrian redoubt in the Old City of Raqqa.
The Iraqi military has pushed insurgents into a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters beside the Tigris river in Mosul; but the resistance has been fierce.
The Rapid Response Division, an elite Interior Ministry unit, called in air strikes just 50 meters away from their targets, and the fighting got close enough at one point for the militants to toss a hand grenade at the troops.
It was from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque that, three years ago, leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a ""caliphate"" over parts of Iraq and Syria. Forces retook the mosque on Thursday, prompting Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to declare an end to the group's ""state of falsehood"".
The number of Islamic State militants fighting in Mosul, by far the biggest city it has ever controlled, has dwindled from thousands at the start of the U.S.-backed offensive more than eight months ago to a couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military.
A commander from the Rapid Response Division estimated more than 10,000 civilians remained trapped inside the area under militant control, including people brought from other areas as human shields.
They are trapped with little food, water or medicine amid the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways, according to residents who have managed to escape.
""The presence of civilians has affected the troops' advance a lot. The directions from the commander-in-chief of the armed forces are to advance slowly to preserve civilians' lives and this is what we are doing,"" the officer said on state TV without being named.
""The area is small but the advance today is very good, relatively.""
He said the progress had also been slowed by a high number of improvised explosives planted in streets and buildings.

This is in response to the failed military coup in Turkey, and after more than 40,000 members have been arrested and 100,000 fired.","The trial of more than 40 Turkish soldiers accused of attempting to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during last year's failed coup started on Monday, February 20, with prosecutors seeking life sentences, according to the indictment obtained by Reuters.
Under tight security, the defendants were bussed in to a courthouse in the southwestern city of Mugla, not far from the luxury resort where Erdogan and his family narrowly escaped the soldiers, fleeing in a helicopter shortly before their hotel was attacked.
More than 240 people were killed during the July 15 failed coup, when a group of rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, warplanes and helicopters, attacking parliament and attempting to overthrow the government.
On Monday, prosecutors in Mugla charged 47 suspects, almost all of them soldiers, with multiple charges including attempting to assassinate the president, breaching the constitution and membership of an armed terrorist organization, according to the indictment.
Turkey says the coup was orchestrated by a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The cleric, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.
Since the failed coup, more than 40,000 people have been arrested and more than 100,000 have been sacked or suspended from the military, civil service and private sector.
Turkey launched its first criminal trial related to the coup in December and more trials are expected.
It was not immediately clear how the suspects would plead in the case. One of the lawyers said they were due to begin their testimony later in the day.

He was originally sentenced to 20 years for his war crimes against humanity working for Stalin, where estimated 2 million people were killed, imprisioned, deported, etc.","A 90-year-old Stalin-era prison commander faced the rest of his life in jail on Wednesday, Feb 10, after Romania's top court dismissed his last appeal against a 20-year jail term for murder and crimes against humanity, Reuters reports.
Alexandru Visinescu was convicted in July of direct involvement in the deaths of 12 inmates, the first case of its kind since the collapse of Nicolae Ceausescu's dictatorship in 1989.
The pensioner, who did not attend the hearing, was waiting in his downtown Bucharest apartment on Wednesday for police to pick up and take him to jail, witnesses said.
He was accused of subjecting inmates to beatings and starvation, and denying them medical treatment and heating, during his time in charge of the institution from 1956 to 1963.
The last survivor of the jail where Visinescu worked, Valentin Cristea, 85, told Reuters he did not want to comment on the case but added: ""I'm now old and sick ... What can I say? The justice system has done its duty.""
Cristea said he had spent six years in the jail on the outskirts of the small town of Ramnicu Sarat, 150 km (94 miles) east of Bucharest for disclosing state secrets to an anti-communist group. He said he lost 20 kg (44 pounds) during his detention.
Earlier in the legal proceedings, which stretched over two years, Visinescu had described himself as a victim of the system who only followed orders, stating at one point: ""I have no regrets, I have no regrets"".
According to the Institute for Investigation of Communist Crimes (IICCMER), up to 2 million people are estimated were killed, imprisoned, deported, relocated or otherwise victimized between 1945 and 1989.
About half a million people including peasants, politicians, priests, doctors, officers, land owners and merchants were jailed in the early 1960s after hastily assembled trials and a fifth of them perished in prisons such as Ramnicu Sarat.
Visinescu, who has been living on a special military pension, will likely go to the municipal prison, a police source said, adding he would likely become the country's oldest inmate.
Former IICCMER head Andrei Muraru said: ""This is a precedent proving political crimes before 1989 can be punished.""",no,N/A

Secretary Clinton’s stroll down Northern Avenue on a beautiful summer evening symbolized the open and spontaneous exchange that must occur between the people and their government,” she said.
“Over the last several years the Armenian government has registered admirable progress in combating the heinous crime of human trafficking. It has demonstrated its commitment to global security, sending troops to Afghanistan and strengthening Armenia's export control regime. Restrictions on freedom of assembly have been relaxed. Citizens detained for actions related to the March 1, 2008 post-election events have been amnestied or granted early release,”
The ambassador went on to say, “More challenges lie ahead, however, and the United States is committed to helping Armenia reach its full potential. The U.S. is determined to facilitate a peaceful solution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. We continue to support Armenia-Turkey reconciliation, both here and in Ankara.

A government cannot increase pensions' amount during reforms, as huge funds are required for their implementation, Hakobyan told a press conference.
According to him, the reforms in Armenia will refer to any working citizen below 40, who will be obliged to pay 5% of his incomes, while another 5% will be added by the state. And various funds controlled by the Central Bank will be managing these sums. A person will have the opportunity to follow on-line the management of his savings and change the managing fund, if there is a necessity in it.
Hakobyan added that as per the current legislation, pensions are paid only in Armenia. And in case of pensioner's absence, his pension can be received by a person having a relevant power of attorney with one-year term. However, if a pensioner is absent from the country for over 10 years, he will be able to receive his pension for only three years upon return. The parliament member noted that it is offered to make such amendments to the legislation, under which people will have the opportunity to receive their pensions both in Armenia and abroad.

They estimate over 3.5-4 Germans consume marijuana and regulations on it do not influence recreation al use, so the government proposes focusing on preventing youths from underage smoking of marijuana.","Germany’s socialist Left party is calling an expert hearing on “legalizing cannabis through the introduction of cannabis clubs” in the German parliament on Wednesday, January 25. The idea has met widespread rejection.
The Left party’s proposal is to allow Germans to open exclusive cannabis clubs, where members will be able to grow marijuana plants. They also recommend that consumers be allowed to own 30 grams of the drug for personal consumption – double the current limit.
The proposal was put together by Frank Tempel, former director of an anti-drug group that worked with police in the eastern German state of Thuringia. Tempel, who is now the Left party’s advisor on drug policy, believes there needs to be a sea-change in the state’s attitude to drugs. “A cannabis ban is the legal model that has the least acceptance,” he said.
He estimates that between 3.5 and 4 million Germans consume cannabis, and that the ban has no influence on the decision to take the drug. The German Cannabis Association (DHV) says there are around 100,000 cannabis-related criminal cases every year.
Tempel believes that the ban actually encourages drug abuse, because it curtails public education. He says the state should prioritize prevention, youth protection and controlling the drug market over criminalization, which is why young people would not be allowed in the proposed cannabis clubs.
The Left party proposal also suggests that local health ministries and public order offices would be able to cooperate with the clubs, DPA reported.",no,N/A

This is part of ISIS's continuous attacks on historical sites and artifacts.,"Islamic State militants have destroyed Palmyra's ancient temple of Baalshamin, Syrian officials and activists said, according to BBC News.
Syria's head of antiquities was quoted as saying the temple was blown up on Sunday, Aug 23. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that it happened one month ago.
IS took control of Palmyra in May, sparking fears the group might demolish the UNESCO World Heritage site. The group has also destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq.
IS ""placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baalshamin today [Sunday] and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple,"" Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim told AFP.
""The cella (inner area of the temple) was destroyed and the columns around collapsed,"" he said.
Residents who had fled from Palmyra also said IS had planted explosives at the temple, although they had done it about one month ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Palmyra is famed for its well-preserved Greco-Roman ruins. The temple built nearly 2,000 years ago was primarily a Roman era artefact. It was dedicated to the Phoenician god of storms and fertilizing rains.
Last month, IS published photos of militants destroying what it said were artefacts looted at Palmyra.
A week ago, it emerged that the archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades had been beheaded by the militant group. Abdulkarim said the 81-year-old had refused to tell IS where some treasures had been hidden to try and save them.
The group has also published photos of what they said was the destruction of two Islamic shrines near Palmyra, which they described as ""manifestations of polytheism"".
The modern city of Palmyra - known locally as Tadmur - is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor. Nearby, the monumental ruins of the ancient city rise out of the desert. UNESCO and others consider the site one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world.

Both versions of the portable display feature the same 1600 x 900 resolution, with full support for pen-based input, which also covers handwriting with 256-degrees of pressure sensitivity. The wired version is tipped to cost $349 while the wireless is priced at $449.
Lenovo also showcased its new ThinkPad Helix at CES 2013. This Ultrabook is powered by an Intel Core vPro processor and features a full HD 11.6-inch display. The machine offers multiple storage and memory capacity options, along with five button click pad and optional 4G broadband. Plus, the 11.6-inch screen can be flipped around, turning the device into something akin to a tablet.
The Helix - which supports NFC technology - is expected to be available in February with an $1499 starting price. Odds are this machine will be available on mobile networks with a subsidy, significantly reducing the cost in exchange for a long-term contract.",no,N/A

This is after Tunisian's uprising three years ago; the people hope to create a full democracy in the face of the instability. ,"Tunisia's Islamist Prime Minister Ali Larayedh resigned on Thursday, Jan 9, to make way for a caretaker government in an agreement with secular opponents to complete the country's transition to democracy, according to Reuters.
Three years after its uprising against autocrat Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia is in the final stages of establishing a full democracy before new elections that would be a rare bright spot in an unstable region.
Tunisia's new premier, technocrat Mehdi Jomaa, must tackle subsidy cuts sought by international lenders to curb the small North African country's deficit and also confront a growing threat from Islamist militants.
Illustrating the continued fragility, troops in the southern city of Tatouine fired into the air and police used tear gas on Thursday to disperse protests over economic hardship.
To end months of political crisis, Larayedh's moderate Islamist party Ennahda agreed late last year to a deal to hand over to an independent cabinet led by Jomaa, who will govern until the election.
""I have just handed my resignation to the president,"" Larayedh told reporters. ""The president will appoint the new prime minister, Mehdi Jomaa, shortly and he will present his new cabinet in the next few days.""
One of the most secular countries in the Arab world, Tunisia has struggled with divisions over the role of Islam and the rise of Islamist radicals since the uprising in 2011 that inspired other revolts in the region.

The decision to fund infrastructure for 1,600 units at Ramat Shlomo settlement, situated on land expropriated from Palestinians, was taken on Sunday, August 25 evening during a meeting of the Jerusalem municipality finance committee.
At the same meeting, the municipality decided to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and Israel’s tourism ministry in allocating a total of £3.6m to the City of David National Park, an archaeological site that dovish Israelis view as the spearhead of an effort to transform the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem into a Jewish area.
Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for the PLO, said that plans to expand Ramat Shlomo “are a continuation of Israel’s policy of carrying out a flagrant ethnic cleansing of East Jerusalem, are a total disregard of US Secretary of State John Kerry’s initiative and a direct blow to peace.” An official in Netanyahu’s office disputed this. He claimed that Ramat Shlomo would be under Israeli rule in any peace agreement.
“It is time we had a more sensible discussion about building in Jerusalem,” he said.
Yonatan Mizrachi, head of the Emek Shaveh organisation of dovish Israeli archaeologists, criticised the City of David move. “The funding means that the government views this as part of Israel…” he said. “There is a gap between what Israel is saying, that ‘we’re negotiating’, and what it is doing.

The headline new feature is the overdue implementation of bookmarks into the browser, BetaNews reports.
It’s also joined by the first Linux beta build since Opera relaunched last year, plus offers a redesigned Start page, integrated PDF viewer and support for web notifications direct from the Windows or Mac desktop.
By far the most significant feature has to be added support for bookmarks, which has been the number one feature request from users since the new Chromium-based version of Opera debuted back in July 2013.
Users can now add bookmarks via the heart button to the right of the main Address bar -- once clicked, users get a choice of images, plus the opportunity to file the bookmark directly into a folder (new or existing). Sadly, Opera has still to implement an import option for quickly transferring bookmarks from other platforms, BetaNews says.
Existing bookmarks can be accessed from the Bookmark Manager, accessible via the Opera menu or by pressing [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [B]. Users browse by folder using the left-hand pane, with that folder’s bookmarks displayed on the right, either as a simple list or as a grid with the associated image used to maximum effect.
Other changes in version 25 are note-worthy by themselves too. The Start page has been redesigned to use tiles instead of screenshots, inspired by Coast, Opera’s iPad and iPhone browser.

In recent years, Switzerland has been actively filled by very wealthy citizens, originally from Kazakhstan. Many of them have chosen this country as a place for their permanent location, not only for the love of the nature beauty, but because of the neutrality of the state. Most of them choose Switzerland as a second home in a means of escape from prosecution in his homeland.
April 12, 2013
PanARMENIAN.Net - One of the most prominent citizens of Kazakhstan, who found refuge on the shores of Lake Geneva - Victor Khrapunov and his family. Until the recent past (before 2008) Khrapunov was mayor of the largest city of Kazakhstan - Almaty, for 7 years, after that he was appointed as a governor of a region of the country, sat in a chair the Minister of Emergency Situations. He left Kazakhstan in spring, 2008.

But it is worth noting that he chose Switzerland not only by chance - he was associated with it for many years. His wife, Leila, a successful business-woman in the distant 90's (when her husband, by the way, sat in the chairs of the Deputy Mayor of Almaty, the Minister of Energy and Electrification of Kazakhstan and Minister of Energy and Natural Resources) had established trade relations with Switzerland. She engaged in importing Swiss goods of the highest quality to Kazakhstan. The children of Victor Khrapunov, Ilyas and Elvira, studied at Geneva. Here, both of them started a successful career. Ilyas Khrapunov today heads the company «Swiss Development Group», which, allegedly, was founded in 2007. The company is engaged in major construction.

Today, in Switzerland Khrapunov is known as very rich people. According to the Swiss magazine «Bilan», Viktor Khrapunov in 2009 was part of a list of three hundred richest people of Switzerland.

But according to the criminal case materials, very meticulously described in the Kazakh media, the main capital was accumulated by Khrapunov while he was a mayor of Almaty city. At home he is accused of receiving large bribes, money laundering, fraud, organizing crime and abuse of power. Well, in general, the entire list, which is traditionally presented to almost all former officials.

The main fault of Khrapunov, which is known for everyone in Kazakhstan- sale of land in unique foothills of the Zailiyskiy Alatau (near Almaty). This area is called the second Switzerland: magnificent mountains, perennial Tien Shan spruce, excellent slopes for downhill skiing. Near Almaty, incidentally, there is the highest ice skating rink in the world - Medeo, a unique ski resort Shymbulak. Victor Khrapunov easily sold the land situated around the coast of almost all small rivers in and around the city deriving them from the register under the ""economic needs"". And the majority of these lands fall under the prohibited category, as they were in the water protection area.

Even after the departure to Switzerland and the appearance of a criminal case in the homeland, Khrapunov began actively claiming that he was ""the initiator of important reforms, he has devoted his career to the development of Kazakhstan"" (from the materials of his site.) And all the illegal construction in protected areas - order from above. ""

However, in one interview Khrapunov blurted out that he signed up all the documents so that no one quarreled. At the same time he purchased a house for himself: ""The Director of ski resort told me that I could make out the purchase of the house ... I signed a contract, the house was completely constructed, and on building construction there were issued all the documents in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan. So I became the legal owner of the house in the area of the ski resort Shymbulak, which was later sold. ""(Over 5 million - auth.) By the way, this house was built in the same restricted area, building permit was signed personally by Khrapunov).

Or another example. A nephew of Khrapunov had bought a recreation area from Khrapunov for a symbolic price, it is located on four acres of land, which was derived from the national park ""Medeo"".",no,N/A

Jack Reed said",4/30/07,USA,,"Senators and Representatives joined Armenians around the world this week in commemorating the 92nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in statements on the floors of their respective chambers of Congress, reported the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) 



A major theme in their remarks was the importance of helping to end U.S. complicity in Turkey's continued campaign of Genocide denial by passing the Armenian Genocide Resolution (S.Res.106 and H.Res.106). Several called specifically for decisive U.S. and international action to end the genocide currently taking place in Darfur, noting that Turkey's ability to commit genocide with impunity has set a dangerous precedent that has encouraged other genocides.



Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said, ""In order for democracy and human rights to flourish, we must not support efforts to rewrite and deny history. In the United States, we strive to make human rights a fundamental component of our democracy. It is long overdue for our nation to demand that the truth be told. We must recognize the Armenian genocide in the name of democracy, fairness and human rights ... It is important that we recognize the Armenian genocide while its survivors are still with us to tell their stories. We must recognize the genocide for the survivors. We must recognize the genocide because it is the right thing to do. We must recognize the Armenian genocide to help shed light on the darkness and move toward a more humane world.""



Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said, ""California is home to many of the descendants of the genocide's survivors, who immigrated to the United States and, over the course of a few decades, built strong and vibrant communities. Working closely with the Armenian - American community over my many years in public service, I know how alive and painful this issue continues to be for many Armenian Americans... Let there be no mistake. The ongoing genocide in Darfur, carried out by the Government of Sudan and its Janjaweed militias, traces its roots to the silence and quiescence of the international community during previous episodes of genocide and ethnic cleansing, including the Armenian genocide.""



Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) said, ""Today, as a proud supporter of S. Res 106, legislation officially recognizing the Armenian genocide, I urge the President to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the U.S. record relating to the Armenian genocide. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated over 50 years after the Armenian genocide that: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere... Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.' The time has come to officially recognize the Armenian genocide... Menk panav chenk mornar. We will never forget."" 



Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) said, ""Mr. Speaker, if America is going to live up to the standards we set for ourselves, and continue to lead the world in affirming human rights everywhere, we need to finally stand up and recognize the tragic events that began in 1915 for what they were: the systematic elimination of a people... And the fact of the matter is that when some of my colleagues say to me, 'Well, why do you need to bring up something that occurred 92 years ago,' I say, 'Because by denying this, the Turkish Government continues to perpetrate genocide or oppression of its minorities.'""



Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said, ""Opponents take issue with the timing of the [Genocide] resolution and argue that Turkey is making progress with recognizing the dark chapters of its history. This claim lost all credibility when Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's Nobel Prize winning author was brought up on charges for 'insulting Turkishness' for alluding to the genocide, and Turkish Armenian publisher Hrant Dink was gunned down outside his office in Istanbul earlier this year. Yet some opponents go even further, such as a former Ambassador to Turkey who argued that the time may never be right for America to comment ""on another's history or morality. ''Such a ludicrous policy would condemn Congress to silence on a host of human rights abuses around the world. After more than ninety years and with only a few survivors left, if the time is not right now to recognize the Armenian Genocide, when will it be?""



Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) said, ""I have always supported the Armenian community. In 2003, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and to plant a tree at the Genocide memorial. We must never forget the horrors that took place 92 years ago. Let us never forget the 1.5 million Armenians who perished in 1915 and 1916. We know such mass murder is not a tragedy from a distant past, but a continuation of the failing to recognize these barbaric acts before they are executed.""



Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-MA) said, ""The writer Milan Kundera once wrote that 'The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.' There are those that would deny the Armenian Genocide... In commemorating the Armenian Genocide we collectively engage in that struggle of memory against forgetting... to reaffirm our commitment to prevent such things from ever happening again, and to strive towards making a better future for the Armenian people.""",no,N/A

16 years in a row on May 8-9 the Azeri press is filled with articles about ""the occupied Shushi"". Every year officials and ""simple citizens"" announce, that ""the day when the occupied Azeri city will be regained back is not far."" The strange thing is though nobody says how and who is going to ""liberate"" Shushi. Most probably it will be realized by the very Afghan mojakheds with their leader Shamil Basaev who disgracefully escaped the Armenian Army. As for ""the native Azeri city"", our neighbors should finally read the historical chronicles.
May 8, 2008
PanARMENIAN.Net - They insist that the ancient Armenian fortress Shushi was given to the murderer of the peaceful Armenian population Persian khan Panakh, in 1752 by the help of the traitor Varanda Shakhnazar. Melik Shahnazar was later executed for the betrayal; however the fortress remained with the Persians. Having won the status of a city in 1857, Shushi increasingly developed and by 60's of XIX century became one of the spiritual centers of the Caucasus. Later on socio-political thought and scientific-cultural elite of the Armenians in the Caucasus developed here. The increasing number of the population of the city is a proof of the tangible growth of the socio-economic and cultural aspect of life. In 1850 12724 people lived in Shushi, in the 90's of the XIX century already 34.000 people dwelled in the city, in 1916 the number of the inhabitants of Shushi became 43.000, and in 1920 there were 60.000 people residing in the city of Shushi. The absolute majority of the population; i.e. 47.000, were Armenians (the numbers are taken from the respective numbers given by the ""Caucasian Calendar""). 

Till 1920 150 books were published in Shushi. Since 70's of the XIX century till 1921 22 magazines and journals were published in Shushi, 2 of which were in the Russian Language, and the other 22 were in Armenian. In the second half of the XIX century in the city of Shushi a number of Islamic religious and other buildings were built. Among these buildings are particularly the Upper and Lower Mosques which have survived up to present day. The Mosques stand for the memory of the Persian architecture, yet the present Azeri authorities say that they belong to them, exactly like the entire inheritance of the Persian Empire, which has remained after its breakdown. 

In March of 1920 the Turkish-Azeri troops burnt and robbed the Armenian part of Shushi, which occupied more than the half of the territory of the city. In three days the number of the population of the city decreased. 30.000 out of 47.000 Armenian population of Shushi became the victims of the formed gangs. 

Then it was the year of 1988. The war unleashed by Azerbaijan against the people of Artsakh turned the ancient Armenian city to a convenient strategic position for opening fires on Stepanakert. More than 15.000 shells were released towards Stepanakert. In the result of the bombarding thousands people of Stepanakert died and were injured, industrial enterprises and administrative offices, the infrastructure of the city were destroyed and 19 thousand people (27%) were left without shelter. Out of the created situation on May 8 the troops of Karabakh initiated an offense of the fire positions and military bases, situated in Shushi and in its outskirts. By the morning of May 9 of 1992 the city of Shushi was liberated by the help of the NKR self-defense troops. ",no,N/A

However, the bank said recent reforms unveiled by China were likely to help it achieve ""more sustainable and inclusive"" growth in the long term.
The Chinese government set out an ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda in November last year, aimed at overhauling its economy over the next decade.
These include reforming the financial and services sectors as well as the big state-owned enterprises.
""If implemented, the reforms will have a profound impact on China's land, labour, and capital markets, and enhance the long-term sustainability of its economic growth,"" the bank said in its latest report.
""Some reforms, including efforts to reduce regulatory and administrative burdens, reform taxation, and make more land available for commercial activities, are also likely to support growth in the short term.""
The bank also cut its growth outlook for Thailand. It predicts that the Thai economy will expand by 3% this year, down from its earlier projection of 4.5% growth.
It said that ""implementation delays and political uncertainties have been the major contributor"" to the slowdown.
A series of anti-government protests in recent months have stoked fears of political uncertainty in the country and its impact on the Thai economy.
The World Bank added: ""The expiry of the car tax rebate scheme, rising levels of household debt, falling commodity incomes, arrears in government subsidy payments to rice farmers, and crumbling consumer sentiment in the face of political instability all crimped consumption"".

The orders come as Trump prepares for his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Florida, where trade issues promise to be a major source of tension. China was the biggest contributor to the $734 billion U.S. goods trade deficit last year, and the meeting ""will be a very difficult one,"" Trump said in a tweet.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters that one of the orders directs his department and the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct a major review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits.

The pirates said they had abandoned the UAE-owned MT Royal Grace, which was seized off Oman last March. The European Union's anti-piracy taskforce said one of its warships patrolling off Somalia had provided food, water and medical assistance to the ship's crew.
""We got off the vessel late last night. We happily divided the cash among ourselves,"" a pirate who identified himself only as Ismail told Reuters by telephone.
Civil war after the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 left Somalia without effective central government and full of weapons. The turmoil opened the doors for piracy to flourish in the Gulf of Aden and deeper into the Indian Ocean.
Said Mohamed Rage, minister of ports and anti-piracy for Puntland - a region in northeast Somalia - confirmed the ransom and the release of the Panama-registered vessel.
It was not clear what cargo the tanker was carrying or who paid to free the vessel, but typically ship owners and the owners of cargo pay ransoms through insurance policies.
In 2011, Somali pirates preying on the waterways linking Europe with Africa and Asia netted $160 million and cost the world economy about $7 billion, according to U.S.-based think tank the One Earth Future foundation.
But the number of successful pirate attacks has since fallen dramatically as international navies have stepped up patrols to protect marine traffic and struck at pirate bases on the Somali coast, prompted by soaring shipping costs, including insurance.
Shipping firms have also increasingly deployed armed guards and laid out razor wire on their vessels to deter attacks.

The weather system affects a huge swathe of the country, from Arkansas in the south to Massachusetts in the north-east. Supermarkets ran out of food amid a rush for supplies before the first snowflakes fell on Friday.
Washington's mayor, Muriel Bowser, said this was a major storm with ""life and death implications"".
The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that the worst of the snow would fall in the Washington area from the early hours of Saturday to the early afternoon, with winds of more than 50mph (80kph).
In a warning at 02:17 (07:17 GMT), NWS tweeted that an ""intense snow band"" was moving through the area.
A webcam of Washington's National Mall showed the ""near-whiteout conditions"" the NWS warned of.
Residents in the capital and surrounding suburbs in Virginia and Maryland have been warned the snowfall could eclipse the district's record of 28in that fell during a two-day period in 1922.
As the weather system approached the country's most populous city, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to be ready.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate, returned from the campaign trail in New Hampshire to take charge of snow preparation.

“Nearly 50 centimeters of snow has fallen on Mount Shingal, endangering the lives of the refugees there,” said Mahma Khalil, Shingal’s (Sinjar) mayor.
Khalil explained that nearly 9,000 families have been suffering the bad winter weather in Shingal and its surroundings. They need fuel, food, clothes and electricity, he said.
He called on the government and international organizations to assist the suffering families.
He noted that the Baghdad’s migration minister had provided each family with a barrel of oil, but it is not enough to fight the cold weather of winter, Khalil said.
He went on to explain that “at least 3,000 families live under tents and 5,040 families in the complexes suffering lack of electricity.”
Shingal, which is a predominantly Yezidi town, was captured by ISIS in August 2014 and liberated by Kurdish forces in November 2015.

A day after pro-government forces captured the strategic al-Shuqeef hill north of the city, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported fierce fighting in areas near the hill and in the Bustan al-Basha neighborhood.
The two sides also clashed in Aleppo's southern Sheikh Saeed neighborhood.
The government's attempt to penetrate Aleppo's opposition-held eastern side has been accompanied by a relentless campaign of airstrikes by Russian and Syrian warplanes.
President Bashar Assad's forces are depending on the Russia bombardment and Iran-backed militias for support.
A spokesman for the Nour el-Din el-Zinki rebel faction told The Associated Press that foreign fighters were actively participating in the government's ground campaign. He said rebels could identify Lebanese and Iraqi militias by their flags.
An airstrike, meanwhile, targeted a rebel headquarters near the central city of Hama, killing at least six militants, the Observatory said. It was a setback for the rebel campaign to advance on the government-controlled city.
The U.N.'s humanitarian chief, Stephen O'Brien, reported that eastern Aleppo's health system has been ""all but obliterated"" by shelling and bombardment.
""Medical facilities are being hit one by one,"" O'Brien said in a statement that called for a 48-hour humanitarian pause to the fighting each week. The U.N. estimates 275,000 people are trapped by the government siege.
""We are in a race against time to protect and save civilians in eastern Aleppo city. They need our urgent action to bring an end to their living hell,"" O'Brien said.
One of Aleppo's largest hospitals, located in the eastern Sakhour neighborhood, was knocked out of service Saturday by the airstrikes, doctors and activists reported.
The Syrian military command said in a statement on state media that government forces would guarantee gunmen safe passage out of opposition-held neighborhoods.
Russia announced a month ago that the Syrian government would give safe passage to civilians wanting to leave eastern Aleppo. Few have accepted the offer.
The U.N. says at least 320 civilians have been killed since the government announced its offensive Sept. 22.
The European Union offered to help evacuate patients in Aleppo's hospitals and deliver food, water and medical aid to besieged eastern districts.
In a statement, EU foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini urged international players to unite to make the aid effort work ""for the sake of humanity and the political future of Syria.""
The EU is mobilizing $25 million in emergency aid and offering to move patients to other medical facilities, including in Europe, if needed.

Over drinks and food, Hakan Kivanc, Turkey's consul-general in Dusseldorf, allegedly told a dinner party of fellow Turks that Germans had Nazi blood and were treating Turks as the Nazis had treated Jews. German conservatives were furious at the remarks. 



A written response by the German Foreign Ministry to federal legislators said that Turkey had suspended Kivanc from the post on Monday 'with immediate effect.' It was not made public till Thursday. 



Christian Democratic supporters of Chancellor Angela Merkel had asked a question in parliament about what the government was going to do about Kivanc, who represented Turkey in Dusseldorf, capital of the state of North Rhine Westphalia. 



Two witnesses made affidavits about the remarks at a private lunch on February 22. Kivanc himself denied the accusations. 



The German Foreign Ministry later spoke to senior Ankara officials about the controversy, which divided Turkish immigrant groups in Germany. Turkish newspapers charged that he had been smeared by legislators who oppose Turkey's desire to join the European Union. 



Kivanc, who was meeting non-Muslim minority Turks, was quoted as saying that if Germans had their way, they would tattoo a 'T' on everyone from Turkey and do to them what the Nazis did to the Jews. 



If you cut open a German, Kivanc was alleged to have said, the spilled blood would be brown, the colour associated with Nazis.

""The launch was seen as testing its capability for short-range missiles. It seemed to be conducted on a military-unit level, not at a national level,"" a military source within the South Korean government told Yonhap. It remains unclear whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un ordered the tests.
The missiles were reportedly KN-02 mobile missiles, which are launched from the back of SCUD-like trucks and have the shortest range of all North Korean missiles.
They are a domestic variant of the Syrian ‘Scarab A’ missile, and have a range of 120-140km. They are usually used to take out large building targets, and can carry a small, tactical, nuclear load.
The news comes just one day after Kim Jong-Un oversaw a live-fire artillery drill near the disputed Yellow Sea border with South Korea, as the South's prime minister visited the area.
North Korea has threatened to unleash a second Korean War - backed by nuclear weapons - in response to UN sanctions imposed after its third atomic test in February and joint South Korea-US military maneuvers, which began last Monday.

Pyongyang's state media said Friday it had informed Seoul that the North will try to send the relatives through the border village of Panmunjom but did not say when.

Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a last remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city. They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
""The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations,"" Darwish said, adding militant sleeper cells in the city were still a threat.
The SDF, with heavy air support from a U.S.-led coalition, said last week they had taken almost complete control of Manbij, where a small number of IS fighters had been holed up.
The SDF's offensive, which began at the end of May, aims to remove Islamic State from areas it controls along the Turkish border.
The Manbij operation in which U.S. special forces have played a significant role on the ground marks the most ambitious advance by a group allied to Washington in Syria since the United States launched its military campaign against Islamic State two years ago.
Manbij's loss to the militants is a big blow as it is of strategic importance, serving as a conduit for transit of foreign jihadists and provisions coming from the Turkish border.
Earlier the alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters grouped in the SDF said Friday's operation was ""the last operation and the last assault.""
Darwish said earlier roughly 100 Islamic State fighters were left in the city center using civilians as human shields, some of whom were killed trying to flee.
Reuters pictures showed residents being released from an Islamic State-held neighborhood on Friday and being welcomed by SDF forces.
Kurdish sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria's five-year-old conflict, later said around 500 cars had left Manbij carrying Islamic State members and civilians. They were heading northeast towards Jarablus, a town under Islamic State control on the Turkish border, the Observatory said.
The convoy carried the final Islamic State members leaving the city, under an agreement between the fighting parties that would not be announced officially, Kurdish sources and the monitor said, marking the end of the operation.
The SDF's campaign quickly captured the countryside surrounding Manbij, but slowed once fighting entered the city. The SDF said it had been avoiding a large-scale assault inside Manbij out of concern for civilians.
Dozens of civilians, including children and women from Manbij who had fled the city at the height of the aerial strikes, were killed in suspected U.S. coalition air strikes last month, residents and monitors said.
U.S. officials have said once the Manbij operation is completed, it would create the conditions to move on the militant group's de facto capital of Raqqa. U.S. officials anticipate a tough battle.",no,N/A

Emilio Lozoya, touted as a possible pick for foreign minister, saidPena Nieto's administration would try to boost efforts to tackle money laundering and propose trans-border infrastructure projects to help create jobs, cut business costs and increase security.
""Today Mexico is investing a bit less than 1 percent of gross domestic product (in security) which is low and clearly not enough to confront this problem,"" Lozoya told Reuters in an interview. ""Investment on security needs to double at least.""
He said U.S. financial aid, while welcome, was small in relation to Mexico's security spending, particularly ""when the end consumer of narcotics is in the United States"".
Pena Nieto proposes focusing efforts on projects that straddle the U.S.-Mexico border such as tunnels and high-tech border crossings, which would create jobs, boost security and promote economic development, Lozoya said.
He said there was also scope for cooperation to fight money laundering and that the United States could help Mexico by stopping automatic weapons from crossing the border and feeding drug gang violence.
""There is a lot that can be done to combat money laundering in particular,"" Lozoya said. ""We are not getting the results that we want. ... The United States can make an additional effort to reduce the flow of arms from there into Mexico.""

Border,N/A,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/interviews/43109/,If Turkey succeeds Armenia will be isolated from the world,7/16/06,Turkey,,"Developments in the Near East can change the balance of forces in the region and influence on Armenia's relations with Turkey and Iran. The main player in the region is the U.S., which is interested in stability in the Near East and Caucasus. This power's wish to push Russia from the South Caucasus, specifically from Armenia, is also an important factor. Professor of international relations and politics of the Universidad de San Andrés in Buenos Aires, Dr Khachik Ter-Ghukassian comments to PanARMENIAN.Net on the ongoing events in the region and their possible impact on Armenia.
The international community attaches big importance to the events taking place in the Neat East. How do you assess the current situation?

The Near East is of great interest for Washington. It specifically refers to the Caucasus. The U.S. is perfectly aware that war with Iran will redouble instability in the region while Washington needs ""an arc of stability"" from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. First of all, it concerns oil. The U.S. stands for cooperation but the situation is tensed, if not explosive. Although, Washington has intentions to improve relations with Iran. 

However, certain difficulties may cause internal developments in the Caucasus. It's quite possible that the map of the Near East may change. Anyway, there are some preconditions for it. The U.S. plans a ""mild"" division of Iraq with further formation of independent Kurdistan. At the same time I should stress that U.S. presence in Iraq doesn't alleviate tension. Unfortunately, the Arab world lacks either political or intellectual force capable to change the situation.

Normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations becomes more urgent for the United States. Can Washington have its will?

At the moment Turkey's foreign policy is targeted at Northern Iraq and improvement of relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan, what includes development of communications and military-strategic partnership. If Turkey's succeeds in realizing its plans Armenia will be isolated from the world. Curiously enough, such state of things is not convenient for the U.S. which insists on opening of the Armenian-Turkish border. However, normalization of relations without preconditions is a dangerous tendency. Turkey doesn't open the border proceeding from political reasons: the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the Armenian Genocide and absence of fixed border with Armenia. The only legal basis for demarcation of borders is the Sevr Treaty. No agreement signed after Sevr, namely the Kars and Moscow treaties, do not have juridical effect, since the signatory powers stopped their existence as elements of international law. The Sevr Treaty was signed August 10, 1920. Borders with independent Armenia had to be marked by a neutral mediator, namely the United States, according to it. 

At that we should not forget that Turkey has always been the biggest danger for the Armenian people. This opinion should be shared by the whole nation, both in Armenia and Diaspora. On the other hand, opening of borders can tell on Armenia's economy. Georgia, where the local industry was destroyed because of the abundant flow of cheap Turkish goods, can serve as an example. Certainly, Armenian economy can't compete with the Turkish, but we will have an outlet to the world, at least. Although, we are not ready to make a reality of the scenario we will be offered.

Iran and Armenia enjoy lasting and friendly ties. How would you comment on them?

If the United States collides with Turkey over Northern Iraq and simultaneously improves relations with Iran, it will be the best scenario for Armenia. Actually, under circumstances Russia's presence as a security guarantor for Armenia will lose urgency. We should strengthen relations with Iran. 

Iran is a minority in the Islamic world, since it practices Shi'ism. This state is the potential regional power. Will Washington have a political force to hold a dialogue with Iran as equals? This is the core of the problem. How the balance will be maintained between the Sunnis (al Qaeda) and Shiites? How the Lebanese problem will be resolved. These are questions that need exact answers. Under any circumstances, the Armenia-Iran relations should be apart any shocks in the region.

220 members of the House of Representatives have supported the Armenian Genocide Resolution. Do you think it will be put on vote?

The U.S. government will use the H.Res.106 as the main took of pressure on Turkey. Struggle between Democrats and Republicans as well as the presidential elections in the United States may speed up or, on the contrary, protract the decision. If Washington is really interested in normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations it will press on Turkey with this Resolution. As to the opinion, that passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution is necessary for the Armenian community of the U.S., I am convinced that opposing Armenia and Diaspora in the Genocide issue is dangerous and immoral.

Argentina is among the states that recognized the Armenian Genocide. How efficient are the activities of the Armenian community of Argentina?

Argentina is the second, after France, state where the Armenian Genocide is recognized on the legislative level. The history of the Genocide is a compulsory subject in schools of Buenos Aires. The Hay Dat Argentinean Office has organized a special textbook. It also holds seminars for school teachers.

I would like to note that Venezuela, which is far enough from the major states of South America, has also recognized the Armenian Genocide. In the 1980-ies Armenians of Argentina and other South American states started integration into in the society. We have become a part of the countries, which gave us shelter. We should proceed on this way basing on the example of the Armenian community of France. 

I should also mention that the first sitting of the South American Parliament will take place July 21. Three states - Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay - have agreed on forming the structure with the capital in Montevideo. Our work will become more coordinated.",no,N/A

The President's proposal of $18,360,000 in Economic Support Funds for Armenia in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 would, if approved by Congress, represent a record low in such aid since Armenia's independence. The White House's proposal for Armenia is over $2 million less than FY 2014's actual economic aid allocation, and less than half of the $40 million requested in a Congressional Armenian Caucus letter and ANCA Congressional testimony submitted last year.
""The White House must match its relentless reductions in aid to Armenia with an equally energetic effort to substantially increase bilateral trade and investment between our two nations,"" stated ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian. ""It's not too late for President Obama, who came into office promising to grow U.S.-Armenia economic relations, to negotiate a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, put in place a badly-needed new Tax Treaty, and organize targeted trade missions promoting cooperation in IT, health care, education, tourism and other key sectors of Armenia's economy.""
The White House's proposal did, however, maintain parity in terms of appropriated military aid, with International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance set at $600,000 and Foreign Military Finance (FMF) at $1,700,000.

The Committee’s specialists predict some activation in the Armenian real estate market but decrease in prices is unlikely in the near future.
May 8, 2010
PanARMENIAN.Net - The construction industry has had a huge share in the GDP structure in recent years, and the country’s economic growth has been secured due to its development. Thus, it is not strange that the global financial-economic crisis has affected the Armenian real estate market since August 2008. The number of transactions conducted during this period decreased by 10.6% as compared with August of 2007. The prices for real estate have started going down and 1.8% decrease was recorded in August as compared with July 2008.

The situation in the real estate market has started improving since September 2009: growth has been recorded both in the number of deals and in prices for real estate. Thus, 6.1% growth was recorded in deals made in September as compared with August 2009, while prices increased by 0.8% and 0.6% in Yerevan and regions respectively. 36,499 transactions were made in the first quarter of 2010 that is 24.3% lower as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and 27.9% higher as compared with the first quarter of 2009. Kotayk and Ararat regions were the most active in the market, these regions’ share in the total number of deals totaled 13.6% and 8.4% respectively. Meanwhile 32.2% of the transactions were made in Yerevan. Some positive trends are observed in the real estate market throughout Armenia. For example, 49.8% of the entire transactions were made in regions in 2001, while this figure amounted to 58.2% in 2004 and 67.8% in the first quarter of 2010.

The market price for 1 square meter in apartment buildings increased by 2.6% in Yerevan and by 1.5% in other cities of the republic in the first quarter of 2009. Meanwhile the highest prices for apartments in Yerevan are continuously recorded in Kentron (Center) district – AMD 470,600 per square meter, while the lowest prices are in Nubarashen district – AMD 143,300 per square meter. Meanwhile, the average price for apartments in Yerevan totaled 271,400 per square meter as of the first quarter of 2010. The prices per square meter in other districts of Yerevan are as follows: Arabkir – AMD 373,900, Kanaker-Zeytun – AMD 283,500, Nor Nork – AMD 234,800, Avan – AMD 235,900, Erebuni – AMD 248,000, Davitashen – AMD 270,300, Ajapnyak – AMD 239,300, Malatsia-Sebastia – AMD 236,700.

As for the regions, the highest prices for real estate were recorded in Kotayk and Armavir regions, amounting to AMD 160,000 per square meter in Abovian and AMD 156,900 - in Etchmiadzin. Relatively low prices were recorded in Tavush, Gegharkunik and Lori regions of Armenia.

2.9% growth was recorded in prices for private houses in Yerevan and Armenia’s regions, totaling 281,100 per square meter in Yerevan on an average. Again, the highest and lowest prices were recorded in Kentron and Nubarashen districts of Yerevan – AMD 484,200 and AMD 147,000 respectively.

Today, Armenia’s financial market faces the challenge of “long-term money” that can be tackled through decrease in interest rates for mortgage loans. The Armenian government has initiated two programs – National Mortgage Company UCO and Affordable Housing for Young Families – to facilitate the mortgage lending. In addition, it has provided state guarantees to construction companies to overcome this difficult period. Thus, some growth has been recorded in mortgage lending since the beginning of this year. It should be noted that the interest rates considerably decreased in 2009, making 8.5-13% against 16-20% two years ago. Population displays greater interest and, hopefully, the market will become even more active by the end of this year.

Three of them are in Apure state. The others are in the state of Zulia, parts of which had already been placed under a state of emergency.
The move is part of a crackdown on crime near the border, where smugglers and guerrilla groups are active. The crackdown has heightened tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.
The president did not say if border posts in Apure would also be closed as they have been in the states of Tachira and Zulia.
Under the Venezuelan constitution, a state of emergency can be declared if the security of the country, its citizens or its institutions are at risk. It temporarily restricts some constitutional rights and allows security forces to search homes without a warrant.
President Maduro took the measure after three soldiers and a civilian were injured in an attack in San Antonio del Tachira near the border last month.
The 2,200km-long border (1,400 miles) between is porous and there has historically been a steady flow of people both ways. It is also a haven for smugglers, who make an easy profit buying subsidised goods cheaply in Venezuela and selling them at much higher prices in Colombia.
The Venezuelan government estimates that up to 40% of goods it subsidises are lost to smuggling, exacerbating shortages of key products.",no,N/A

Violence has spread from Tunisia and Egypt to Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and Djibouti, presenting the United States with the dilemma of maintaining stability in the oil-rich region while upholding the right to demonstrate for democratic change.
Protests in Libya's second city of Benghazi on Feb 18 against Gaddafi's four decades in power were unprecedented with Amnesty International saying 46 people had been killed in a three-day crackdown.
Funerals of dead protesters could act as further flashpoints for demonstrators emboldened by uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt that toppled long-ruling presidents.
Analysts say a key difference between Libya and Egypt is that Gaddafi has oil cash to smooth over social problems. Gaddafi is also respected in much of the country, though less so in the Cyrenaica region around Benghazi.
""For sure there is no national uprising,"" said Noman Benotman, a former opposition Libyan Islamist who is based in Britain but is currently in Tripoli. ""I don't think Libya is comparable to Egypt or Tunisia. Gaddafi would fight to the very last moment,"" he said by telephone from the Libyan capital.

A strong euro tends to result in higher oil prices by making crude priced in dollars cheaper for traders using currencies other than the greenback.

According to EDB’s latest Macroeconomic Overview, the economic growth in Armenia in the first quarter of 2016 was higher than expected. The Macroeconomic Overview notes that the increase in production capacities and in basic exports, despite unfavorable prices at international commodity markets and weaker external demand, were instrumental in securing 4.4% year-on-year GDP growth in quarter one of 2016.
In April 2016, the economic activity index grew to 6.8% against the same period in 2015, securing a 6% growth for the first four months of 2016 in annual terms. According to the National Statistical Service of Armenia, economic activity index in January-May amounted to 5.5%.
""Despite an increase in public and private sector salaries, the recession in the Russian Federation will hold back recovery in consumer demand due to the reduction of factor incomes and remittances,"" the EDB says.
According to EDB analysts, weak domestic demand, the growth in mining industry output and increase in exports will remain the main drivers of economic expansion in Armenia in 2016.
EDB also says the lowering of the refinancing rate in May 2016 to 7.75% by Armenian central bank was aimed at supporting domestic demand, along with measures taken by the government to encourage investments and lending.
In the medium term perspective the revitalization of domestic demand and the implementation of infrastructure projects are expected to push economic growth up to 4.2% in 2017 and 4.1% in 2018, according to EDB.

The price of Brent crude collapsed from $115 in June to $45.19, the lowest in almost six years, in January due to oversupply. Since January, mounting signs of lower industry spending have helped prices move higher.
Apache Corp, a top U.S. shale oil producer, said on Thursday it would cut capital spending and its rig count in 2015 following the price collapse, keeping its output growth mostly flat.
Brent for April delivery was up 76 cents at $60.04 by 0917 GMT, after briefly gaining more than $1. The March contract expired overnight. U.S. crude was up 61 cents at $51.82.
""During the last weeks, crude oil rebounded driven by improved market sentiment and by expectations that low prices will lead to lower supply growth in 2015,"" said Daniela Corsini, analyst at Intesa Sanpaolo, in a report.
Besides Apache's update, Royal Dutch Shell's chief executive said on Thursday supply might not be able to keep up with growing demand as companies reduce budgets, and France's Total announced investment and job cuts.
Still, analysts at JBC Energy in Vienna pointed out in reference to Apache's moves that spending cuts can easily be reversed.

Despite the nascent recovery, many ECA countries are still grappling with lower wages and higher unemployment resulting from the global crisis. If no countervailing measures are undertaken, and unemployment does not fall fast enough, the increases in food and energy prices could push 5.3 million more people across the region into poverty, with most of the higher poverty due to the food price increases.
Poverty could increase in some of the lower income countries of the region. Potential increases in poverty rates could reach 11 percentage points for the Kyrgyz Republic, 9 for Armenia and Georgia, 8 for Tajikistan, and around 5 percentage points for Moldova.

The ANC is calling for active protests, what its representative describe as “the guarantee of victory.” Social Democrat Hunchakian party chairperson Lyudmila Sargsyan believes that protests may grow into social revolts.

The leader of the winning Democratic Party in the parliamentary elections in Kosovo Hashim Tachi announced that right after December 10 the authorities of the country will proclaim its independence. The announcement made by Tachi evoked the predictable reaction of the EU, as one of the members of the international ""three"" on identifying the status of Kosovo, which replaced the UNO after the failure of the Ahtisaari plan. The truth is that at present moment the UNO is too concentrated on the Near East, to really take an interest in the Balkans and that's why is willing to solve this problem as soon as possible.
November 20, 2007
PanARMENIAN.Net - The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States call upon the Kosovo Albanians to refrain from one-sided declaration of independence, whereas Washington promises to recognize the independence of the country already in January. Russia's viewpoint is clear; it is against the separation from Serbia and suggests ""wide autonomy"" instead. Practically the world found itself in a diplomatic deadlock, which is fraught with inner tensions in the Balkans. The truth is that the EU special representative for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby is more optimistic about things. ""I hope that the declaration of independence of Kosovo will not become a destabilizing factor in the Balkans,"" he said also adding that in this case the disposition of the EU depends on the fact that the Kosovo problem is a special case. ""Every conflict has its own history, its specific character and every conflict needs an individual approach, respecting the international law. The resolution of the Kosovo problem must not have any influence on the resolution of other conflicts but perhaps it is inevitable that Kosovo will give birth to hopes or apprehensions for other unsolved problems. Nevertheless, the EU is always for the resolution of any kind of conflict exceptionally from point of view of international law,"" emphasized the Finnish diplomat. In his turn the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden Carl Bildt announced that Hashim Tachi must understand the difference between the announcements made by an oppositional politician and by responsible political figures. 

Several years ago Carl Bildt was the active mediator in the negotiations held over the issue of the status of Kosovo, which he called ""the most sensitive region in Europe, where any abrupt movement may be fatal"". The EU representatives and the UN Administration in Kosovo say that Tachi most probably will put the declaration of independence off till a more suitable period, to achieve a maximum support abroad. ""Tachi will take an advantageous position, but he will do nothing unless Washington and the EU key Member States give him the permission. He very carefully follows America's advice. And they choose mid January,"" quotes the British The Guardian the words of a UN official, working in the capital of Kosovo Pristina. ",no,N/A

Turkish and Azerbaijani officials reportedly are seriously mulling the possibility of Armenian participation in the long-planned Nabucco pipeline project as part of a comprehensive Karabakh peace pact, EurasiaNet reports.



Turkey is leading efforts to energize the Karabakh peace process. Turkish, Armenian and Azerbaijani officials met in New York on September 26 to discuss the Karabakh issue and other security matters. That meeting kindled hopes that a settlement could be achieved by the end of 2008.



Although details of the recent discussions have been scarce, some experts believe that the three sides have probed a possible bargain under which Armenia would become part of the Nabucco pipeline plans, in return for a greater degree of flexibility concerning Yerevan's position on Karabakh.



Yerevan's willingness to modify its long-standing demand for Karabakh independence would appear to be the key as to whether this latest push for Karabakh peace can be successful. Azerbaijani officials seem willing to work with Armenia on the Nabucco project, if Yerevan shows sufficient flexibility on Karabakh. ""Of course, Azerbaijan has set political conditionality related to the Karabakh conflict on this [Nabucco] issue,"" Elhan Shahinoglu, the director of the Baku-based Atlas center for political research, said.



Turkish analyst Sinan Ogan, the chair of the Ankara-based TURKSAM think tank, said that the topic of Armenia's participation in the Nabucco project came up during US Vice President Dick Cheney's recent, controversial visit to Baku. ""There are serious plans to involve Armenia in this project. Turkey and Azerbaijan were against this idea at first, but now Armenia's participation seems realistic,"" Ogan said in comments broadcast September 19 on Voice of America radio.



Initial indicators are that the three sides did not make significant headway on the Karabakh issue during the September 26 meeting in New York. On September 28, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan flatly admitted that 'there are no concrete results yet,"" according to a report distributed by the RIA-Novosti news agency.

According to the letter Azerbaijan has launched a fraudulent campaign aimed at misleading the international community and justifying its policy of using force or threat of force against the people of Nagorno Karabakh.
“The rehabilitation of the Stepanakert airport is the sovereign right of the NKR and pursues solely civilian and humanitarian objectives, including realization of such a basic human right as freedom of movement. Freedom of movement of the civilian population of the NKR alongside with other human rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other core international instruments have already been continuously and vehemently undermined by the ongoing Azerbaijani blockade. This stance of Azerbaijan is a clear manifestation of its upright disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms as a continuation of its policy of collective punishment of civilian population,” NKR Foreign Minister’s letter reads.
“The threats of Azerbaijan to shoot down civil aircrafts in particular, violates the provisions of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and runs counter to the commitments undertaken in the framework of the negotiation process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair states, to reject any threat or use of force against civil aircraft, pursue the matter through diplomatic steps, and refrain from politicizing the issue.
Such threats, along with the statements on the highest level declaring all Armenians of the world as enemy number one of Azerbaijan are a vivid example of the long-established anti-Armenian hysteria and xenophobia of the Azeri state policy. The pardon and nationwide glorification of Ramil Safarov, Azerbaijani officer, who was convicted to the life imprisonment in Hungary for perpetuating brutal hate crime, a manslaughter, is the most shocking yet just recent manifestation of this policy. In this context, my Government considers the steps taken by the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in particular declarations on undertaking “all necessary measures” in order to prevent the functioning of the Stepanakert Airport along with previous threats to shoot down civil planes as irresponsible and politically charged actions,” the letter ran.
Minister Mirzoyan called upon the UN Secretary General, the UN and its specialized agencies, as well as all peace-loving Member States to assist in the rehabilitation of the Stepanakert airport to ensure that the people of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic are able to exercise their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.

In a Facebook post, Sargsyan said it was a well-considered decision while Sharmazanov said personal issues were involved as well.
Armenia's Constitutional Court declared controversial clauses to the law on cumulative pensions invalid on April 2. At a hearing on Wednesday, the court ruled that provisions imposing mandatory cumulative pension system are at conflict with the country's basic law.

According to the Constitutional Court, the government and parliament must protect the citizens’ right to ownership.

Pension,N/A,http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/241583/,Cézanne masterpiece to lead “Actual Size” sale,6/9/17,UK,,"At the turn of the century, Paul Cézanne’s revolutionary works began the process of the fragmentation of reality in art that opened the door to modernism. Returning to a subject that had captivated him since the 1860s, the artist used the classical subject of bathers from the grand French tradition as a compositional tool for a completely new and free aesthetic. The masterful use of translucent patches of watercolour renders the human figures almost weightless – the nudes are fully embraced by nature. Adding to the rarity of the richly-composed and vibrant artwork, the triangular composition reveals a view of Montagne Sainte-Victoire. Thus, in such a small scale, Cézanne is able to perfectly capture the most important subjects and ideas that formed his artistic legacy. A generation of artists saw a new world of possibility in his innovative use of space and light and, in just a few square inches, the very DNA of Picasso’s inspiration for Cubism and his iconic Les Demoiselles d'Avignon can be found. Dating from the last period of his life, and appearing at auction for the first time in almost three decades, Baigneuses, La Montagne Sainte-Victoire au fond is estimated to bring £4 – 6 million as the cover-lot of Sotheby’s inaugural Actual Size sale on 21 June, Art Daily reports.
The illustrious provenance of this work further underpins its quality and desirability, having been included in two of the greatest single owner sales in Sotheby’s 273-year history. Its story began in the collection of Cézanne’s son, also named Paul, and found its way into the legendary collection of German industrialist Robert von Hirsch – who had assembled one of the world’s most significant collections encompassing Impressionist and Modern paintings, alongside Old Master and Medieval works of art. In June 1978, a series of seven sales of von Hirsch’s collection at Sotheby’s made history – with the extraordinary total making front-page news on most English newspapers – to this day it is considered to be one of the most successful auctions ever. It was in this sale that the work was bought by the British Rail Pension Fund for £140,000 ($259,000). In the mid-1970s, the British Rail Pension Fund made the bold decision to invest in art – perplexing their pensioners and stunning fund managers. The Impressionist collection formed 10% of the total amount and proved the strategy successful in April 1989 when twenty-five works acquired for £3.4 million sold at Sotheby’s for a combined total of £35.2 million.
A masterpiece in its own right, this work also relates closely to one of the three late Grandes baigneuses that Cézanne was working on at the time of his death, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Cézanne’s watercolours and drawings will be the subject of an extensive exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Basel from June until September 2017.
In June this year, to coincide with its flagship sales in London, Sotheby’s will stage a deceptively ‘small’ sale. Bringing together a range of works from across the 20th and 21st centuries, with occasional surprises from earlier moments, this first-of-its-kind sale will include a broad mix of exceptional paintings, sculptures and works on paper which share one common characteristic – each one will be no bigger than the size of the catalogue page on which it is illustrated, in ‘Actual Size’.
Thomas Bompard, Head of Sotheby’s London Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sales and Curator of Actual Size, said: “At just five by eight inches, this show-stopping watercolour has all the power and grandeur of a great Renaissance fresco. All of Cézanne's genius is right here: like a magician, he conjures form from nothing more than light and colour; and in this rare moment he brings together the two subjects he held dearest. It's a major tour de force on a miniature scale. It's the father of modernism at his best. And for many reasons, the perfect cover lot for Actual Size”.",no,N/A

The Qatari Investment Authority (QIA) has been in competition with two Chinese insurance companies, Ping An and China Life, to buy the 656ft tower, which is London’s largest office building, from South Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS).
The tower has made – and lost – considerable sums for its owners in recent years.
In 2009 NPS bought it from HSBC for $1.3bn, which means that, on paper at least, the Korean firm has realized a profit of $500mln in only five years.
HSBC took the building over in 2008 after its owner, the Spanish property company Metrovacesa was hit by the financial crash. Metrovacesa bought it for $1.76bn in 2006.
HSBC has a 13-year lease on the building and an agreement that links rent increases to the UK retail prices index.
The deal is the third largest in the UK in recent years, behind Blackstone’s sale of 50% of the City of London’s Broadgate complex to Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund for $2.7bn, and Armenian billionaire Dikran Izmirlian’s sale of More London to St Martin, a state-owned Kuwaiti property company, for about the same amount.
The QIA already owns a number of London landmarks, including Harrods department store, the London Stock Exchange and the Shard tower at London Bridge.
The fate of the HSBC tower, which was designed by Foster + Partners and completed in 2002, contrasts sharply with the Gherkin tower in the City of London, which was designed by the same firm and built in 2004.
The owners of the Gherkin (its proper name is 30 St Mary Axe), IVG Immobilien, called in the receivers in April after it defaulted on bank loans.

Park, Choi and Lee have all denied wrongdoing. Samsung Group did not immediately have comment, but has in the past denied it ever paid bribes or sought improper favors from Park.
The investigation looked into an influence-peddling scandal involving Park, who was impeached by parliament in December after accusations she had colluded with her long-time friend Choi to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back the president's policy initiatives.
The 65-year-old daughter of a former military strongman has had her powers suspended. The Constitutional Court will rule on whether to uphold parliament's December impeachment of Park. The court is expected to hand down its decision sometime in March.
Should it uphold the impeachment, Park would become the country's first democratically elected president to be thrown out of office and spark an election in Asia's fourth-largest economy.

The document -- part of the agency's routine review of Iran's program -- states that the IAEA ""has continued to observe, through satellite imagery, the presence of vehicles, equipment and probable construction materials.""
""In addition,"" the report continues, ""a small extension to an existing building appears to have been constructed.""
Critics of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran are likely to seize on this detail of the report.
Speaking to reporters, State Department spokesman John Kirby would not address the content of the leaked document, a copy of which was obtained by CNN and other news outlets, but remarked that the U.S. views Parchin as ""a conventional military site, not a nuclear site.""
""So there wouldn't be any IAEA or other restrictions on new construction at that site were they to occur,"" he said.
A senior U.S. intelligence official acknowledged the presence of heavy construction equipment earlier this month, but told CNN such activity could not conceal the presence of radioactive material.
""The (International Atomic Energy Agency) is familiar with sanitization efforts and the international community has confidence in the IAEA's technical expertise,"" the official said at the time.
But the IAEA report comes amid renewed scrutiny with regard to the Parchin site after it was revealed that Iranian inspectors would be taking an active role in IAEA-monitored inspections there.
""Allowing the Iranians to inspect their own nuclear sites, particularly a notorious military site, is like allowing the inmates to run the jail,"" Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham said of the arrangement, according to CNN.
Apart from the observation of construction activity at Parchin, the IAEA's report reflects a number of positive steps Iran has taken to comply with its obligations under the nuclear deal and the interim nuclear deal that preceded it.
Iran has provided the IAEA with access to declared facilities and has complied with enrichment restrictions.

The communications equipment and other items are being funneled for now only to non-armed opposition groups, the U.S. officials said.
But the move nevertheless boosts Syria's beleaguered rebels, who saw their international support slide after Islamic militants seized bases near the Turkish border that had been under the authority of a key U.S.-backed leader.
It could also be seen as a U.S. reward to the opposition for its participation in ongoing peace talks with President Bashar Assad's government in Geneva.
The U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity, said the aid was being sent through Turkey into Syria, with the coordination of the Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council, led by Gen. Salim Idris, a secular-minded, Western-backed moderate.
They stressed that the halt in supplies last month was only a ""precautionary measure"" until the Obama administration could once again verify the security of aid packages, according to the AP.
Items taken in December from the Bab al-Hawa crossing between Syria and Turkey have since been returned, the officials said, and U.S.-supported rebel groups have taken steps to prevent future supplies from being diverted.
Direct, nonlethal U.S. assistance to armed Syrian rebel units could resume soon, U.S. officials said. They provided no indication about the status of lethal assistance such as body armor and ammunition.
Britain also suspended deliveries some six weeks ago and Turkey shut its side of the border as fears over the growing strength of extremist jihadis crystallized in the takeover of the warehouses and bases by the Islamic Front, a new alliance of six of the most powerful Islamic rebel groups in Syria.
It was a stark demonstration of how Idris's influence had diminished amid the rise of al Qaeda-affiliated militants flush with cash, weapons and battleground experience.
More than 100,000 people have died in Syria's civil war, now in its third year. Internationally brokered peace talks began last week in Switzerland, but have made little to no headway, with most of the discussions centered on improving access for humanitarian groups and potential prisoner releases.
Syria's fractured opposition movement has been losing ground militarily for several months as rebel factions turn their guns against each other, undermining the battle to oust Assad.
The U.S. officials said they resumed deliveries of a range of goods to civilian actors in Syria as early as late December. These included ambulances, garbage trucks, generators, food baskets, school supplies and office equipment.
The officials the aid is going to local and provincial councils and civil society groups, and the United States is confident the deliveries are reaching their intended recipients. They stressed U.S. support for the ""moderate armed and unarmed opposition remains steadfast.""",no,N/A

“In the interests of the Defense Ministry, Izhmash is working on the modernization of the AK-74 and AK-100 assault rifles in service with the Russian army, as well as developing a [new] standard assault rifle on the AK-12 platform which will undergo state acceptance trials in June 2013,” Izhmash’s chief designer, Vladimir Zlobin said on Monday, April 29.
If the trials are successful, the new assault rifle will be put in production and will be adopted as a service weapon for the military.
Development of the AK-12 began in mid-2011. The new weapon retains the overall layout and features of the AK-74, in service with the Russian army since the 1970s, but features several modifications and ergonomic changes.
The new assault rifle has being developed as a basic platform for nearly 20 different modifications of the weapon. It could be adapted for cartridges varying from 5.45x39 mm to 7.62x51 NATO.
According to Izhmash designers, they “have adapted the weapon to modern combat requirements, having preserved Kalashnikov's unique qualities - simplicity, reliability and relatively low production cost.”
The rifle features three firing modes: single shot, three-shot burst and automatic fire. The muzzle of the AK-12 has been designed to shoot foreign-standard barrel-mounted grenades.
The weapon is also equipped with Picatinny rails to mount optical, and night sights, grenade launchers, target indicators and other special equipment.

The U.S. continues to render assistance to Armenia for formation of civil society and implementation of democratic reforms. As a co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, the U.S. promotes resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. However, the U.S. Embassy in Armenia has been functioning without Ambassador for 18 months already. PanARMENIAN.Net requested U.S. Charge d'Affairs Joseph Pennington to comment on the Armenian-American relations and development prospects.
What is the present level of Armenian-American relations? 

There is a historical aspect to it, with obviously deep cultural ties because of the Diaspora and there is, of course, also the political dimension of the relationshipand economics and trade and a business relationship as welland military relations, for that matter, through NATO. Of course all of those aspects of the relationship are important and our partnership in most of those areas is beyond question. And so I would say as a general comment, our relationship is very strong in the sense that we have cooperation across a broad range of issues. 

How would you describe the relationship in terms of political, economic developments? 

Obviously we believe that we have played a constructive role over the years, since the independence of Armenia, in Armenia's economic development and the development of democracy here. The U.S. government has allocated more than - or almost - 2 billion USD over the years in assistance to Armenia. And that continues today both in our ordinary bilateral assistance and also in the MCC Program. Of course the MCC program is also affected by political developments and reform. 

Is the suspension of MCC compact possible in Armenia? 

The short answer is yes, it is possible that there could be problems with the MCC program and Ambassador Danilovich has made that clear in letters to former President Kocharyan and President Sargsyan. And the reason for that is not because the United States is looking to reduce our support to Armenia or to punish Armenia is some way, but the reason is that the Millennium Challenge Program itself is based on an agreement between the U.S. government and the Armenian government that yes, the assistance will be provided, but also with the reforms in the democratic area. And the events around the election campaign, the election day, the recounts, the post-election situation that lead ultimately to violence and the state emergency - all of those things are things that called into question the current authorities' commitment to democratic reform. And so what we have said both privately to the government and publicly is that we want to continue the Millennium Challenge program because it will help hundreds of thousands of Armenians out in rural areas, but at the same time we can only do that if the authorities return Armenia to a democratic path and regain momentum on democratic development. 

Please speak about American-Armenian military cooperation both within the framework NATO and outside of it? 

Well, of course the most visible and well-known example of military cooperation is through the partnership program that Armenia has with NATO, which Armenia has made good progress on fulfilling the commitments under its purpose. There is also of course the cooperation and the contribution that Armenia has given on the ground in difficult places like Iraq and Kosovo which is tremendously appreciated by the United States. We specifically are very pleased that as of about a week ago, Armenian has doubled its commitment to troops on the ground in Kosovo. And at the same time, the United States military provides in a number of military areas assistance to Armenia whether it's for equipment, training, help with drafting strategic military documents and so on, civilization of the military. And so there are a lot of aspects to the military relationship which we think is developing well. 

Hearing on the nomination of the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia will start tomorrow? Will they be successful or not?

First of all, we are very pleased that we have a great nominee, Ambassador Yovanovitch. I think Armenia is very lucky that that appointment has been made. We look forward to her coming and she will do a fantastic job. Of course in our system, as you are aware, there is this Senate approval as required of the nomination and the process will start Thursday on the hearing. We are hopeful that the process will go without significant problem and that Senate will approve Ambassador Yovanovitch and that will happen quickly. We think Armenia deserves to have a fully represented U.S. mission here that includes an ambassador but of course the Senate has its own business to do and I can't predict the outcome, but we are hopeful that it will be positive and that we will have an ambassador soon. No one will be happier that I will be to see her to come. 

We are afraid that the story with Ambassador Hoagland will be repeated again.

I certainly hope not. I think it would be negative for both the United States and the U.S.-Armenian relationship but that is not in our hands, that's in the Senate's hands and we'll see how it comes out. 

Do you share the position of the Minsk Group as a Co-Chair country? 

Right, we have been through many years an active participant of the Minsk Group process and we see that process as the appropriate avenue. We were very pleased to see from statements through governments that the last meeting went well. And we hope that that meeting is something that can be built upon. We expect the co-chairs back in the region probably by the end of this month to start the next round of the process. But in our view, of course, there is no alternative. And we will continue working very hard with our partners. 

If Azerbaijan starts war, what will be the reactions of the United States? 

I am afraid that's just a hypothetical question that I can't really answer. But we would expect and hope that that hypothetical never comes to pass. 

Recently different ways of reconciliation have been observed on the public level between Turks and Armenians. Is it possible that these contacts might serve ground for further strengthening of the relationship? 

First of all, this is an extremely important issue in my view for both Turkey and Armenia for the future of both countries and for the stability in the region. I've worked now for many years of my career in both of those places and so I have a real personal interest in this issue. And we, you know the United States for a long time has supported increased cultural, social ties, the ties we call people-to-people contacts between Turks and Armenians. And just as an example, tomorrow night I am going to open a performance at Komitas Hall of the Bosporus Quartet of Istanbul. The Komitas Quartet performed in Istanbul last week. And it is one example. There are many projects like that that we support and will continue to support. We think that those kinds of contacts - conferences, exchanges, academic debates and so on, they help to break down barriers and ultimately help to push the political process forward. And we also continue to work at the levels of governments to try to encourage the two sides to take steps to overcome their differences. And we certainly hope that in the not-too-distant future there will be some progress at that level as well. 

You have worked in Turkey. How the treat Armenian? What is their attitude towards the events of 1915? 

It's a very interesting question. I first worked in Turkey from 1995-1998, so back 10-13 years ago, and I can say that the difference between those years and now in terms of this debate is very clear. I think there is a much greater willingness among many people in Turkey to talk more honestly about the past and look at those events more openly. And if you look in the Turkish media, you see a quite lively debate about Armenia and about Turkey and Armenia. And it's part of an overall opening in Turkey in terms of activating civil society and democratization. Of course, there are also problems, and we saw the convictions under article 301 in Turkey for a number of years and certainly there are still people who don't want to have this discussion and people who tragically were willing to resort to violence against Hrant Dink when he spoke about it. But I can tell you that I met with Hrant in the last week that I worked in Turkey back in 2006 and Hrant's approach was that the most important thing that we - all of us - Armenians, Turks and international community...Hrant was convinced that by improving that relationship, that would encourage a greater and more honest look at the past. And so that's the direction that we try to work in.",no,N/A

Ozerov added the decision marks Russia’s “substantial input” into the international effort to stabilize the situation in Syria.

The official start of the Russian military operation in the Syrian Arab Republic was September 20, 2015, although construction works and relocation of military hardware to the Khmeimim airbase were apparent weeks before that.
The operation is logistically the most difficult that Russia has conducted in modern history, with dozens of ships transporting supplies across the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

In the Iranian Presidential Elections, the first stage of which is on June 12, main opponents are current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the latter supported by reformers and, what is quite important, by the youth up to 30 years old, who form 60% of the country's population. The elections in Iran are not so much important for the country itself. The vital point is whether the country will be able to join the world-wide system of values, which it has been refusing for 30 years already.
June 12, 2009
PanARMENIAN.Net - However, it's worth mentioning that these 30 years were not lost. After Ayatollah Khomeini came to power, Iran that was on the verge of collapse, developed into a strong and prosperous country, presently pretending to the position of the regional power. The nuclear ambitions of Iran played an important role in achieving this, although it is yet unknown whether they are real or it is simply a game with the muscles of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one of the participants in the assault on the American Embassy in 1979. They say Ahmadinejad lives in an old house of his, drives an ordinary car and is in no way like a president of a regional power. Nevertheless, he was able to win the previous elections and now has all the chances to duplicate the success, of course if he is really agreeable to the western partners. And here the complicacies begin. In the issue of Iran, the USA and Europe have opposite positions, to say nothing of Russia that has her own interests in the region and holds age-long ties with the Persian Empire. For Europe, Iran is important as the supplier of alternative energy and Teheran knows it well. For the USA, she is an ""Empire of Evil"" or something closest to it. But the Obama Administration is far from Rice and Cheney, who managed to convince the world that Iran must be punished for her nuclear program. There is one more important detail in the difference of approaches of Europe and the USA towards the future of Iran - the ocean. America is rather far and the problem of energy security of Europe doesn't worry her much. Or, better to say, it worries her but from purely imperial points of views. The same is true about Russia, but she is nearer and therefore - more dangerous.

""To me, this election is basically a referendum on President Ahmadinejad,"" says Nasser Hadian, Political science professor at Tehran University. In order to gain victory the current President used all the existing resources. The official media outlets, television and majority of newspapers are under his control. He travels through the Iranian province, where majority of his electorate lives. But his opponent is strong too. Fifty-four per cent of Iranians are ready to vote for former Prime Minister of Iran Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Let us note that he used to be the prime minister of the country for 8 hardest years - during the Iran-Iraq war. In 1988 Iran signed cease-fire, reached through the UN mediation. A year later Ayatollah Khamenei replaced late Ayatollah Khomeini in the position of the Spiritual Leader of Iran. The posts of the President and the Prime Minister were combined into one. President of the country became Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mousavi had to leave political life. After former President Khatami declared his unwillingness to participate in the coming elections, Mousavi announced his candidacy. And today he is the main rival for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Both Khatami and Mousavi are ethnic Azerbaijanis, but in a wider sense this makes no difference; any President of Iran will carry out the policy, which is advantageous to his country. The only matter is whether he will be able to carry it out and whether both internal and external forces will let him do it. Quite possibly Iran enters a new phase that was once interrupted after the withdrawal of Khatami, one of the first reformers. But, who knows, the positions of Ahmadinejad are rather strong too. On the other hand, Mousavi has promised to make the country more democratic. For instance he intends to repeal the order in which the standards of Moslem morals are controlled by the special police of dispositions; he is also ready to change the role of woman in the society.
