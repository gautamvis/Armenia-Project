At least 28 killed in Pakistani bomber attack",7/1/13,"Quetta, Pakistan",N/A,"28 people were killed by a suicide bomber in Quetta, Pakistan. The bomber was orchestrated by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, who continue attacking the ethnic Shi'ite minority known as the Hazara and is affiliated with Takfiri Deobandi school of Islam who see Shi'ites as infidels.","At least 28 people were killed and dozens wounded in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta on Sunday, June 30 when a suicide bomber attacked a largely Shi'ite Muslim neighborhood, police said, according to Reuters.

The blast appeared to be the latest in an escalating campaign of gun and bomb attacks by militants on ethnic Hazaras in Quetta because they belong to Pakistan's Shi'ite minority.

Mir Zubair, Quetta's police chief, said a suicide bomber riding a bicycle had detonated his explosives when he was stopped at a barrier in the Hazara Town district, a Hazara enclave on the western edge of the city.

""The dead included nine women, a girl and a 14-year-old boy,"" Zubair told reporters.

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a militant group which has carried out many gun and bomb attacks on Hazaras in Quetta, said it was behind the bombing. A spokesman for the group called the Express News television channel to make the claim.

The group is aligned with the Takfiri Deobandi school of Islam, which sees Shi'ites as infidels.

Lashkar has intensified its campaign in Quetta this year. Earlier this month, it claimed responsibility for an attack in which a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying women students in Quetta and then gunmen stormed a hospital treating survivors. More than 20 people were killed from various ethnic groups.",No

They will hand the information and IP addresses of these people over to her while other cases like this continue around the world.,"When Nicola Brookes posted a message of support on Facebook about her favorite contestant on The X Factor talent competition, she found herself the victim of incessant and constant torment from anonymous cyberbullies. But rather than take the abuse sitting down, Brookes decided to fight, taking her assailants to court. And she won.

In her suit, Brookes claimed to have been the victim of a number of slanderous, malicious attacks. Her attackers created a page on the social network that branded the Brighton, U.K. woman as a drug dealer and a pedophile. The court ruled that Facebook must turn over the names, email addresses, and IP information of the trolls who tormented her.

For its part, Facebook is not expected to fight the court order. The company will comply as soon as it is officially served papers by the court, explaining in a statement that, ""we respect our legal obligations and work with law enforcement to ensure that such people are brought to justice.""

Brooks, who filed the suit after having trouble getting the police to take her problems seriously, appears to be satisfied with the court's ruling. ""I want them exposed,"" said Brookes. ""They exposed me and they invaded my life. I didn't ask for it. They wanted a reaction from me and now they have got it.""

This is not the first court case involving a victim suing a cyberbully — a Georgia teenager filed a lawsuit against her Facebook attackers after the girl's school and police failed to help. Previous courts here in the U.S. have similarly stripped internet users of their anonymity in response to criminal threats, Today in Tech reported, citing The Guardian.

It is produced by Jason Reitman."," A trailer for Jason Reitman‘s next film, “Men, Women & Children”, hit the web, TheWrap said.

The “Juno” and “Up in the Air” director is coming off the bummer bust of his adaptation of the book “Labor Day,” which mixed crime and melancholy into a period piece starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet, who played a woman entirely disconnected from the world. This time around, Reitman presents a more contemporary setting, with cell phones and technology causing so much interconnection that people are miserable all over again.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Adam Sandler likes hookers, his wife Rosemarie DeWitt likes at least one other man, “Short Term 12” star Kaitlyn Dever feels left out, Jennifer Garner is mopey, “Fault in Our Stars” breakout Ansel Elgort isn't sure how to text, and all in all, it's tough living in the suburbs.

Below is the synopsis of the film, which is adapted from a book written by Chad Kultgen and debuts at the Toronto Film Festival:

“Men, Women & Children” follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose – some tragic, some hopeful – as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.

http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/177760/,Ukraine may spiral into crisis with unpredictable consequences: Lavrov,4/8/2014,Ukraine,N/A,Ukraine continues to have instability between Russia and the EU. Lavrov continues to believe Russia helps them and he along with the Russians argue the EU is partially to cause the instability.,"The profound and pervasive crisis in Ukraine is a matter of grave concern for Russia, the country’s Foreign Minister said in a piece published by the Guardian.

“We understand perfectly well the position of a country which became independent just over 20 years ago and still faces complex tasks in constructing a sovereign state. Among them is the search for a balance of interests among its various regions, the peoples of which have different historical and cultural roots, speak different languages and have different perspectives on their past and present, and their country's future place in the world,” Lavrov said.

“Given these circumstances, the role of external forces should have been to help Ukrainians protect the foundations of civil peace and sustainable development, which are still fragile. Russia has done more than any other country to support the independent Ukrainian state, including for many years subsidizing its economy through low energy prices. Last November, at the outset of the current crisis, we supported Kiev's wish for urgent consultations between Ukraine, Russia and the EU to discuss harmonizing the integration process. Brussels flatly rejected it. This stand reflected the unproductive and dangerous line the EU and U.S. have been taking for a long time. They have been trying to compel Ukraine to make a painful choice between east and west, further aggravating internal differences,” he said.

Ukraine's realities notwithstanding, massive support was provided to political movements promoting western influence, and it was done in direct breach of the Ukrainian constitution. This is what happened in 2004, when President Viktor Yushchenko won an unconstitutional third round of elections introduced under EU pressure. This time round, power in Kiev was seized undemocratically, through violent street protests conducted with the direct participation of ministers and other officials from the U.S. and EU countries, according to the Russian minister.

“Assertions that Russia has undermined efforts to strengthen partnerships on the European continent do not correspond to the facts. On the contrary, our country has steadily promoted a system of equal and indivisible security in the Euro-Atlantic area. We proposed signing a treaty to that effect, and advocated the creation of a common economic and human space from the Atlantic to the Pacific which would also be open to post-Soviet countries,” he said.

“In the meantime, western states, despite their repeated assurances to the contrary, have carried out successive waves of NATO enlargement, moved the alliance's military infrastructure eastward and begun to implement antimissile defense plans. The EU's Eastern Partnership program is designed to bind the so-called focus states tightly to itself, shutting down the possibility of co-operation with Russia. Attempts by those who staged the secession of Kosovo from Serbia and of Mayotte from the Comoros to question the free will of Crimeans cannot be viewed as anything but a flagrant display of double standards. No less troubling is the pretence of not noticing that the main danger for the future of Ukraine is the spread of chaos by extremists and neo-Nazis,” Lavrov said.

“Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilization in Ukraine. We are firmly convinced that this can be achieved through, among other steps: real constitutional reform, which would ensure the legitimate rights of all Ukrainian regions and respond to demands from its south-eastern region to make Russian the state's second official language; firm guarantees on Ukraine's non-aligned status to be enshrined in its laws, thus ensuring its role as a connecting link in an indivisible European security architecture; and urgent measures to halt activity by illegal armed formations of the Right Sector and other ultra-nationalist groups,” he said.

“We are not imposing anything on anyone, we just see that if it is not done, Ukraine will continue to spiral into crisis with unpredictable consequences. We stand ready to join international efforts aimed at achieving these goals. We support the appeal by foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland to implement the February 21 agreement. Their proposal – to hold Russia-EU talks with the participation of Ukraine and other Eastern Partnership states about the consequences of EU association agreements – corresponds to our position. The world of today is not a junior school where teachers assign punishments at will. Belligerent statements such as those heard at the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on April 1 do not match demands for a de-escalation. De-escalation should begin with rhetoric. It is time to stop the groundless whipping-up of tension, and to return to serious common work,” the Russian Foreign Minister concluded.",No

Mercedsunstar.com reports that UC Merced will award the prize to Balakian during an evening ceremony April 12. He'll give a public speech the next day.

The Spendlove Prize, established through a gift from Sherrie Spendlove in honor of her parents, lifelong Merced residents Alice and Clifford Spendlove, honors one person each year. Previous honorees include former President Jimmy Carter and Merced native Charles Ogletree, a professor of law and executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard University.

Balakian is the author of the memoir ""Black Dog of Fate,"" which won the PEN/Albrand Prize for memoir and a New York Times Notable Book.

In the book, Balakian writes about learning what his family and ancestors experienced with the Turkish government's extermination of more than 1 million Armenians in 1915, including many of his relatives. The massacre led to the creation of the word ""genocide"" and served as a template for Nazi Germany's Holocaust.

A humanities professor at Colgate University in New Jersey, Balakian is the recipient of many awards and prizes and civic citations, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, the Emily Clark Balch Prize for poetry from the Virginia Quarterly Review. He has appeared widely on national television and radio programs including ""60 Minutes,"" ""ABC World News Tonight,"" ""Charlie Rose"" and ""Fresh Air.""

Foreign editions of his work have appeared in a dozen languages including Arabic, French, Dutch, Hebrew, Greek and Turkish.

http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/210499/,Cannes Critics’ Week rolls out 2016 lineup,4/18/2016,"Cannes, France",N/A,Cannes' movies list has been released.There are no Americans. ,"There are no American features to be found in Critics’ Week at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, as the parallel section dedicated to first and second films will privilege European productions — alongside movies from countries as far-flung as Turkey, Lebanon, Cambodia and Singapore, Variety reports.

The 55th edition of Critics’ Week will kick off on May 12 with Justine Triet’s “In Bed With Victoria,” a light-hearted, frank and contemporary comedy about a young single mother (played by Virginie Efira) trying to find the balance between her career and her love life. According to Critics’ Week artistic director Charles Tesson, this sophomore offering from the Cesar-nominated director of “Age of Panic” (which opened in the ACID section in 2013) underscores a willingness to shake up the sidebar and marks a change in tone from the typically serious-minded movies that constitute the rest of the section.

The Critics’ Week selection committee sifted through 1,100 feature-length submissions in order to come up with the final 10, which include six feature debuts and four sophomore outings.

Addressing the absence of features from the American continent at Critics’ Week (after last year’s four entries), Tesson explained his disappointment with trends he saw at this year’s Sundance. “After launching films such as ‘Take Shelter’ and ‘It Follows,’ it’s possible that we’ve raised the bar too high for American movies, and we were more inspired by movies coming from France, Southern Europe, Asia and the Middle-East that allow us to explore uncharted territories,” said Tesson.

The selection entails various films that touch on current issues in a cinematic and original way, for instance Mehmet Can Mertoglu’s “Album,” about deep-rooted prejudice in Turkey, Vatche Boulghourjian’s “Tramontane” about a blind man on the trail of his origins in post-war Lebanon, and Kesavada Rajagopal’s “Yellow Bird,” an unusual portrait of Singapore torn by conflicts between Chinese and Indian communities.

Tesson said the French directors of this year’s lineup, notably Julia Ducournau with “Raw,” Jean-Christophe Meurisse with “Apnee” and Justine Triet with “In Bed with Victoria” are bold and innovative in their own ways. “Apnee,” for instance, is an omnibus feature laced with surreal, ferocious humor looking at today’s French society.

Closing night will consist of three short films from actresses making their directorial debuts: Sandrine Kiberlain’s “Smile,” Laetitia Casta’s “En moi” and Chloe Sevigny’s “Kitty” — the latter being the lone American to be found in a lineup that is framed by female talent.

Tesson said “all three shorts work well together as if they dialogued with each other,” sharing the themes of acting, womanhood and transformation.

The competition boasts just one other distaff-directed feature, the cannibalism-themed “Raw” from French helmer Julia Ducournau, who won a Critics’ Week prize for her short “Junior” in 2011. Her latest centers on a 16-year-old (Garance Marillier) who makes a radical break from her family’s vegetarian ways after sampling flesh during her first day at veterinary school.

A symbol of its 50+5 edition, Critics’ Week will play the shorts of two filmmakers who were discovered at the Cannes sidebar: Cesar Agusto Acevedo with “Los Pasos de agua” and Nadav Lapid with “From the Diary of a Wedding Photographer.”

The 2012 report on anti-Semitism indicated that the confluence of extreme rightwing political movements and Islamic radicalism have been responsible for a new wave of anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe.

Based on data collected by the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at Tel Aviv University, Edelstein noted that “the main conclusion emerging from the document... is that compared to 2011, there was an escalation in violent incidents against Jews around the world.”

While the claimed surge in anti-Semitic incidents is connected to incitement against Israel, the report admitted, it also claimed that there was no direct correlation between any specific actions or policies taken by the State of Israel and the rising violence.

The worst increase in anti- Semitism was seen in Western Europe, according to the report, which listed a number of incidents in France and Germany, including the bombing of a grocery store in Sarcelles, France and the shooting deaths of four Jews at the Otsar HaTorah religious school in Toulouse.

Many synagogues in France are now surrounded by high concrete walls and receive special police security details on major holidays. It is also common for Jews in many French cities to remove their kippot for safety reasons when walking outside.

The report said France was the leading country for anti-Semitic incidents with 114 reported in 2011, followed closely by the UK with 105. Canada and Australia reported 68 and 30, respectively.",No

The pay cable network has optioned the book, published last fall, for the comedy project, which will be produced by Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Prods. under the company’s deal at HBO. Kramer will write the script and executive produce.

These Things Happen is set in present day Manhattan and focuses on two couples – one gay, one straight. They share a 15-year-old son, who lives on the upper East Side with his mother and doctor stepfather. Trying to get to know his impressive, distant father better, he moves in for a semester with him and his long-time partner who forms an instant friendship with the boy.

“What’s it like to be a 15-year-old boy living in New York City and have your best friend come out as gay? In These Things Happen, award-winning television writer, director, and producer and first-time novelist Richard Kramer has provided a smart, funny, and insightful exploration. Wesley and his oldest and closest friend Theo are growing up and attending private school in the city. Their days are filled with college coaches (you need an edge to get into Brown), soccer practice, homework, and hormones. Wesley is currently living with his father, a well-known and respected gay activist, and his father’s boyfriend George, a former theater actor and co-owner of the restaurant above which they live. (“I’m not a very queenie queen,” declares George.)

Tenth grade appears to be going swimmingly, and Theo has just won the race for class president. Theo surprises everyone, including himself, when he announces, at the end of his acceptance speech, that he is gay and sets the true motion of the novel rolling. As Wesley tries to deal with this new reality and figure out how to have a relationship with important and unavailable father, everyone else in his life has to evaluate what Theo’s revelation means. When an act of violence turns up the emotional volume, the results are often not pretty, even for these educated, well-meaning people.

Although the first pages might give the impression of a light story and a quick read, These Things Happen is neither. We experience the action from the point of view of each main character in their distinctive and often charming voices as they stumble their way through a difficult situation and find their way back towards each other. They are a very introspective bunch, which sometimes hindered the story for me and made reading more difficult. The end result, however, is still a touching coming-of-age story and moving portrait of where our society is in its acceptance, and lack thereof,” a review published at BC said.",No

http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/interviews/43109/,If Turkey succeeds Armenia will be isolated from the world,7/16/2007,Armenia and Turkey,N/A,If Turkey continues its current foreign policy goals Armenia will be isolated because of its relations with Iran. They hope the US will be a neutral mediator in Armenian Turkey relations,"Developments in the Near East can change the balance of forces in the region and influence on Armenia's relations with Turkey and Iran. The main player in the region is the U.S., which is interested in stability in the Near East and Caucasus. This power's wish to push Russia from the South Caucasus, specifically from Armenia, is also an important factor. Professor of international relations and politics of the Universidad de San Andrés in Buenos Aires, Dr Khachik Ter-Ghukassian comments to PanARMENIAN.Net on the ongoing events in the region and their possible impact on Armenia.
The international community attaches big importance to the events taking place in the Neat East. How do you assess the current situation?

The Near East is of great interest for Washington. It specifically refers to the Caucasus. The U.S. is perfectly aware that war with Iran will redouble instability in the region while Washington needs ""an arc of stability"" from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. First of all, it concerns oil. The U.S. stands for cooperation but the situation is tensed, if not explosive. Although, Washington has intentions to improve relations with Iran. 

However, certain difficulties may cause internal developments in the Caucasus. It's quite possible that the map of the Near East may change. Anyway, there are some preconditions for it. The U.S. plans a ""mild"" division of Iraq with further formation of independent Kurdistan. At the same time I should stress that U.S. presence in Iraq doesn't alleviate tension. Unfortunately, the Arab world lacks either political or intellectual force capable to change the situation.

Normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations becomes more urgent for the United States. Can Washington have its will?

At the moment Turkey's foreign policy is targeted at Northern Iraq and improvement of relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan, what includes development of communications and military-strategic partnership. If Turkey's succeeds in realizing its plans Armenia will be isolated from the world. Curiously enough, such state of things is not convenient for the U.S. which insists on opening of the Armenian-Turkish border. However, normalization of relations without preconditions is a dangerous tendency. Turkey doesn't open the border proceeding from political reasons: the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the Armenian Genocide and absence of fixed border with Armenia. The only legal basis for demarcation of borders is the Sevr Treaty. No agreement signed after Sevr, namely the Kars and Moscow treaties, do not have juridical effect, since the signatory powers stopped their existence as elements of international law. The Sevr Treaty was signed August 10, 1920. Borders with independent Armenia had to be marked by a neutral mediator, namely the United States, according to it. 

At that we should not forget that Turkey has always been the biggest danger for the Armenian people. This opinion should be shared by the whole nation, both in Armenia and Diaspora. On the other hand, opening of borders can tell on Armenia's economy. Georgia, where the local industry was destroyed because of the abundant flow of cheap Turkish goods, can serve as an example. Certainly, Armenian economy can't compete with the Turkish, but we will have an outlet to the world, at least. Although, we are not ready to make a reality of the scenario we will be offered.

Iran and Armenia enjoy lasting and friendly ties. How would you comment on them?

If the United States collides with Turkey over Northern Iraq and simultaneously improves relations with Iran, it will be the best scenario for Armenia. Actually, under circumstances Russia's presence as a security guarantor for Armenia will lose urgency. We should strengthen relations with Iran. 

Iran is a minority in the Islamic world, since it practices Shi'ism. This state is the potential regional power. Will Washington have a political force to hold a dialogue with Iran as equals? This is the core of the problem. How the balance will be maintained between the Sunnis (al Qaeda) and Shiites? How the Lebanese problem will be resolved. These are questions that need exact answers. Under any circumstances, the Armenia-Iran relations should be apart any shocks in the region.

220 members of the House of Representatives have supported the Armenian Genocide Resolution. Do you think it will be put on vote?

The U.S. government will use the H.Res.106 as the main took of pressure on Turkey. Struggle between Democrats and Republicans as well as the presidential elections in the United States may speed up or, on the contrary, protract the decision. If Washington is really interested in normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations it will press on Turkey with this Resolution. As to the opinion, that passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution is necessary for the Armenian community of the U.S., I am convinced that opposing Armenia and Diaspora in the Genocide issue is dangerous and immoral.

Argentina is among the states that recognized the Armenian Genocide. How efficient are the activities of the Armenian community of Argentina?

Argentina is the second, after France, state where the Armenian Genocide is recognized on the legislative level. The history of the Genocide is a compulsory subject in schools of Buenos Aires. The Hay Dat Argentinean Office has organized a special textbook. It also holds seminars for school teachers.

I would like to note that Venezuela, which is far enough from the major states of South America, has also recognized the Armenian Genocide. In the 1980-ies Armenians of Argentina and other South American states started integration into in the society. We have become a part of the countries, which gave us shelter. We should proceed on this way basing on the example of the Armenian community of France. 

I should also mention that the first sitting of the South American Parliament will take place July 21. Three states - Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay - have agreed on forming the structure with the capital in Montevideo. Our work will become more coordinated","Yes"

A total of four Wheel employees, including cofounders Paul Boukadakis and Chris Shaheen, will join the Tinder team in West Hollywood. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Wheel has raised a total of $3.2 million in VC funding to date, according to Pitchbook.

In an interview with Business Insider, Boukadakis said that discussions with Tinder began a few months ago when he showed the Wheel app to Tinder chairman Sean Rad.

""What we were doing with content was all about connecting a young demographic around creating content together,"" he said. ""There was a lot of synergy with what we were doing and what they were doing.""

Boukadakis, who will be Tinder's VP of Special Initiatives, said that Wheel was designed to “lower the barrier for entry to content creation” and ""make connecting more comfortable.""

Rather than facilitating messages between two people, Wheel collects videos around specific themes, like holidays or school trips, that can be added to by others. When the app was in beta last summer, high schoolers created a themed video story for Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonations that eventually caught the attention of Schwarzenegger himself, who then posted to the story.

http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/details/224275/,The story of Judo,"October 28, 2016",Not applicable,N/A,Today is world Judo day. It looks at how Jigoro Kano creates Juro.,"The World Judo Day is the birthday of Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo. Today, more than 20 million people practice judo around the world on a daily basis. The IJF has 200 national member federations and five continental unions.

The takenouchi-ryu martial art system founded in 1532 is considered the beginning of Japan’s Jujitsu forms. Judo was derived from Jujitsu, the art for either attacking others or defending oneself with nothing but one’s own body.

In 1882, Jigoro Kano made a comprehensive study of the ancient self-defense forms and integrated the best of these forms into a sport which is known as Kodokan Judo. The term Kodokan breaks down into ko (lecture, study, method), do (way or path), and kan (hall or place). Thus it means “a place to study the way”. Similarly judo breaks down into ju (gentle) and do (way or path) or “the gentle way”.



Jigoro Kano was born in 1860 to a sake-brewing family in the town of Mikage, Japan. However, Kano's father was an adopted son and he did not go into the family business. Instead, he worked as a lay priest and as a senior clerk for a shipping line. Kano's father was a great believer in the power of education, and he provided Jigoro, his third son, with an excellent education. Kano's mother died when the boy was nine years old, and his father moved the family to Tokyo. The young Kano was enrolled in private schools, and had his own English language tutor. In 1874 he was sent to a private school run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills.

Standing 1,57m but weighing only 41kg, the youth was the object of daily tyranny and bullying by older and stronger boys. Tired of classmates’ mockery, he strived for physical strength. It was then that he became interested in jujutsu, a martial art he once had heard about.

In 1875, Kano's first attempt to be admitted for jujutsu training was rejected. After learning that many former jujutsu practitioners became osteopaths to earn a living, Kano found a clinic run by Sadanosuke Yagi, who really practiced jujutsu in the past. However, the youth’s request for instruction was refused. Yagi, in turn, referred him to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'yo-ryu was itself a combination of two older schools: the Yoshin-ryu and Shin no Shindo-ryu.

Fukuda's training method consisted mostly of the student taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the mechanics of the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.



Kano had trouble defeating Fukushima Kanekichi, who was one of his seniors at the school. Therefore, Kano started trying unfamiliar techniques on his rival. He first tried techniques from sumo. When these did not help, he studied more, and tried a technique (""fireman's carry"") that he learned from a book on western wrestling. This moment gave a start to his career.

At the age of 22, Kano became an instructor and opened a dojo of his own in rented premises. Using the money he earned, he prepared a 12-mat dojo which he called the ""Kodokan"". He also changed his school from ""jujutsu"" to ""Judo"". While gathering students and teaching Judo, he also began to incorporate the principles of body, mind, and character development into his Judo philosophy.



The categorization of Kodokan Judo was completed about 1887. The Kodokan had three broad aims: physical education, contest proficiency and mental training.

Proceeding with the organization of the Kodokan and enacting the regulations of Judo, Prof. Kano became the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee in 1909 and worked for the spread of Judo world-wide. Judo became an official event in the Olympic Games of Tokyo in 1964, backed by Judo fans and sport promoters all over the world.

Jigoro Kano attained a doctorate degree in Judo, a degree equivalent to the twelfth dan, awarded to the originator of Judo only. He constantly worked to ensure the development of athletics and Japanese sport in general, and as a result is often called the ”Father of Japanese Sports”. In 1935, he was awarded the Asahi prize for his outstanding contribution to the organizing of sport in Japan during his lifetime.",No

A visit by company representatives turned into a surprise for the 52-year-old homeowner Hayk Baghdasaryan and his family.

The foundation of the Bagdasaryans’ house was laid 20 years ago when they were full of hope that finishing construction is not a major problem. The homeowner has been able to build only the walls and a concrete ceiling so far.

Throughout two decades, Hayk’s family - his wife and the three adult sons - had to live at Hayk’s paternal house, then rented the neighbor’s half-damaged house. The elder son, Argishti, now serves in the army in Martakert, while the two sons go to school.

The partnering organizations promised that the construction of the half-built house will be finished by the end of the year.

“My happiness is endless. We have not had any good news for so long. My entire family, my wife, my sons and I have worked hard to finish the construction of our half-built house, but to no avail. We could only meet our everyday needs,” said the father of the family, Hayk.

“The housing project supports low income families in building and renovating their houses.
