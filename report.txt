Objective: write software to automate the process of scraping web articles relating to governmental distribution of public goods in Armenia. Categorize these articles according to the provided labels (ex. education related, army related, etc.) or mark them as irrelevant. Also attempt to parse metadata from the article, such as topic, date, etc.


Tools:
Python 2.7.15 - Libraries used: sklearn(SVM implementation), pandas(parsing CSV data), numpy(format data s.t. it can be used with sklearn), bs4, requests, selenium
Chromedriver

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done so far:

	Obtain data from Jane in form of excel sheet with article info, text, label

	Find a way to preprocess text

	Determine a machine learning method that would work well in this process - bag of words model Linear SVM classifier

	Use school dataset to begin with 

	Given articles returned using the 'school' keyword, write linear classifier to predict only whether the article is relevant to schools or not

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:

	classify articles based on all labels, instead of just relevancy

	scrape data from armenpress

	run trained classifier on this data to determine relevant articles

	find accuracy

	optimize

	repeat process for russian articles

	repeat process for armenian articles
